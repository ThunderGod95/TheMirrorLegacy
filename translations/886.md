# Chapter 886: Forged

Li Ximing made his decision. The three cultivators before him nodded in agreement. He passed medicinal pills to Li Jiangqian, then gestured for Li Jianglong and Li Jiangxia to choose their dharma artifacts.

The dharma artifacts from the Golden Tang Gate, both Reflecting Metal and Geng Metal types, were laid out. At the very least, these Metal Virtue items wouldn't conflict with their Bright Yang cultivation. Li Jianglong selected a golden ring, accepting it with a word of thanks. Li Jiangxia, however, showed no such courtesy. He hefted one weapon after another, weighing them, before finally picking out two golden spears of nearly identical shape and weight.

"You are all dismissed. Que'Wan, stay behind."

Li Ximing waved his sleeve. The three brothers departed, while Li Que'wan walked from behind him to stand nervously at the front.

"Sit."

Li Ximing's voice was soft. "There was something I couldn't say in front of Jiangqian just now. Wang Quwan is under our clan's protection. If he succeeds in reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, it will be impossible to hide many of the clan's secrets from him. As for sending him to Jiangbei, that is a matter of his own destiny."

"It's just... his brothers. I must trouble you to help smooth relations between them."

Li Que'wan replied quickly, "The young masters all understand the greater good. Their insight and experience are far beyond my own... I should be the one learning from them."

Li Ximing’s expression turned serious. "Jiangliang and Jiangnian. What is your assessment of those two?"

Li Que'wan hesitated for a moment before answering. "Jiangliang was taught by Senior Jueyin and is quite intelligent, but his heart has long been set on leaving. From what I've seen, he's already made friends in the outside world. His mind truly isn't on the lake. As for Jiangnian... I've only met him a few times, but his temperament is kind and gentle, not at all like his brothers."

"Forget it..." Li Ximing shook his head. "The Li family has no shortage of daughters, yet none have emerged with the character of my aunt. Minggong is obedient but lacks resolve and courage. The moment Chenghui fell all those years ago, I knew we were in for trouble."

"As for the Zhouxing generation, the Old Master discussed them with me. Zhouming is incompetent. Zhouluo has the Yang family backing him and feels little attachment to the lake; our family has never been one to force anyone. Zhouda is still in seclusion, and his success is uncertain. Xinghan has talent, but her parents are minor figures in the clan. They lack the knowledge to guide her and will only hold her back. Besides, her own temperament is nothing to boast about."

Li Ximing sighed. "It is often said that the North-South conflict broke the spine of the great clans. Those words are true. Our family is considered one of the fortunate ones, yet we still suffer the consequences of that era. Aren't those two from Purple Smoke in the same predicament?"

He let out another breath. "And as for Jiangqian's brothers, they all have their own ambitions—far too many ambitions. It's only manageable because Zhouwei and I are here to keep them in check. And what about the outside? In the North and the South, there are countless eyes fixed squarely upon them!"

As Li Ximing finished his lament, his thoughts drifted to the matter of shaking Great Ancestor Wei, Li Qianyuan's, Fruition Attainment. His mood darkened.

"Take this copy of the Sublime Method of the Vast Profound Magnetic Light," he instructed. "Study it well. Understand your enemy. We will not dwell on these other matters any longer. Shichuan is nearly forged, and the Great One still has more than a year."

He said no more, stepping into the Great Void and traversing space to arrive at Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

'Just over a year...'

Li Ximing calculated on his fingers. A year wasn't nearly enough time for any significant cultivation. He could practice the six cycles of Embyronic Breathing, but at most, he would only absorb a single stream of qi for his second divine ability.

'But Bai Yinzi's location is a problem,' he mused. 'It's on the other side of the river, and the Buddhist cultivators will likely interfere. If a fight breaks out and I'm badly injured, this entire year of cultivation will have been for nothing.'

Just as he thought this, another realization struck him. 'If that happens... I'll also end up wasting a strand of Xuanguan Crimson Fire Qi. Then I'll be forced to make a trip to the Cui clan's Chongzhou Island.'

Considering this, Li Ximing changed his mind. 'This year is perfect for practicing spell arts. It might seem like I'm sharpening my spear at the last minute, but it's the right choice. With Jiangqian in seclusion for his breakthrough, the family is short on defenders anyway...'

He sat in quiet contemplation.

Spell arts had always been Li Ximing's weak point. He was completely confident in his alchemy, but in combat, he lacked Li Zhouwei's skill with the halberd. His early years had been divided between practice and refinement, so it was no wonder his spell arts were lacking. Now that he had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, it was time to shore up this deficiency.

'I don't possess the kind of profound Dao attainment that can turn decay into magic. Spell arts usable at my realm must be at least fourth-rank. The absolute best spell arts in all of Jiangnan are no higher than sixth-rank. Right now, I only have a basic foundation in two: the fourth-rank Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, and the fifth-rank Sun's Resonant Radiance Art.'

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was an orthodox Bright Yang technique. It resonated with the Heavenly Light between his brows, and its power was respectable. It was fine for fending off opponents, but landing a killing blow was difficult. Furthermore, pushing its power any higher was nearly impossible. The Sun's Resonant Radiance Art, however, was a higher rank and the spell art he had mastered fastest. After practicing it by the sea for several years, it was finally presentable.

'But the Dharma Arts bestowed upon Jiangqian back then were far more than that. There was the fifth-rank movement technique, Tread on Flames; the fifth-rank escape art, Heavenly Fire's Crimson Shine; the sixth-rank Dharma Art, Great Radiance of White Brilliance; and the fifth-rank Dharma Art, Wall of Primordial Radiance.'

To put it bluntly, that inheritance was enough to establish a Daoist tradition on par with Crimson Reef Island. The only issue was that they were all Radiant Fire spell arts, making them exceptionally difficult to learn. They would have been easier if they matched his core cultivation method, but for a Bright Yang cultivator, it was bound to be troublesome.

Li Ximing had studied them before. Aside from Great Radiance of White Brilliance, which required Purple Mansion Realm Radiant Fire, only the Sun's Resonant Radiance Art had felt natural. Now, with his divine abilities perfected, he read them again. He squinted, studying them for a long time, completely torn. Finally, he selected Tread on Flames.

Compared to the other arts, Tread on Flames made the least use of 'Li Light' and didn't require profound Dao attainment. It was similar to the Sun's Resonant Radiance Art in that its requirements for flame were higher. For Li Ximing, this was undoubtedly the easiest one to begin.

'When I'm wielding the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, my movements are bound to be clumsy. Audience with the Celestial Gate can strengthen my body, but it's still better to master a proper movement technique.'

He had also recently acquired a new palm strike. It wasn't based on deep Daoist theory, but it utilized Talisman Qi and its power was impressive. Tread on Flames was a fifth-rank movement technique. If he could just gain a basic mastery, it wouldn't be enough to handle Changxiao, but it would be perfect for close-combat against someone with little real Dao attainment, like the Merciful One.

He took out the two manuals and began to read.

'Radiant Fire resides in the heavens, a brilliant and clashing star... it presides over inauspicious conjunctions. Thus, escape arts are difficult. Only the movement art of treading on flames is suitable...'

The Sun's Resonant Radiance Art and Tread on Flames sprang from the same source. Studying them together proved mutually beneficial, as each filled the gaps in the other. Aided by his Talisman Qi's ability to guide fire and manipulate energy, his progress was barely passable.

Light and shadow intertwined. Time flowed like a river. Flames surged, a crow cawed, and a rustling sound filled the air as purple embers spiraled upward.

"Ding-ling..."

A wind chime on a nearby jade pillar chimed softly, untouched by any breeze. Only then did Li Ximing awaken as if from a dream.

He felt as though he had only been pondering for a moment, manipulating flames and practicing the two Dharma Arts. Yet, someone was already ascending the mountain to report. He looked down and realized the ground was covered in a nearly three-foot-deep blanket of gardenia blossoms. A few stray sparks danced upon the petals, slowly winking out as his focus returned.

He calculated the time. More than half a year had passed.

'No wonder most Purple Mansion Realm cultivators seem so indifferent and detached... This half-year felt like less than a month. If I truly entered deep seclusion, what would I even remember of the world...'

"Come up!"

Li Ximing savored the lingering sensation of his practice, silently deepening his comprehension, as an old man climbed the steps. A red robe was draped loosely over his burly frame. It was, of course, Chu Minglian.

When he reached the top of the stairs, he stopped. Seeing the ground covered in blossoms and the pristine jade pillars, he hesitated, afraid to trample them. Li Ximing's heart leaped with joy. In an instant, he flickered through space and appeared directly in front of the old refiner.

"Congratulations, Daoist Master! The spirit embryo is complete!"

"Haha!"

Delight spread across Li Ximing's face. With a flick of his brow, the Heavenly Light shot out, wrapped around Chu Minglian, and pulled him across the Great Void. They materialized on the Viewing Pavilion Platform, where a large crowd of cultivators immediately dropped to their knees. Chu Minglian bowed deeply beside him.

"Congratulations, Daoist Master!"

The shouts from below were like a tsunami. Refining the spirit embryo had required the assistance of many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators working in rotating shifts, so the news hadn't been a secret. For a time, voices of congratulations echoed from every direction.

Li Ximing beckoned lightly. A dense, twofold radiance of azure and yellow light rose from the platform's center. The azure light was ethereal and winding; the yellow light was majestic and heavy. They swirled together, a beautiful, chaotic mix like two colors of fine sand poured into one.

"Clang!"

Luminous, azure-and-yellow patterns of mountains and rivers erupted from the Viewing Pavilion Platform. A sound like a tidal wave crashed over the assembled cultivators, sending them staggering. It was followed by the crushing pressure of the Heavenly Light, as oppressive as a cage.

Li Ximing smiled and waved his sleeve. In an instant, all the phenomena vanished, retracting into the dharma artifact as its true form was revealed.

It was a ruler. Its body was a bright yellow, shot through with flickering silver motes. Expansive, intricate patterns in the color of azure jade depicted mountains and rivers. It was over a foot long, about an inch wide, and robustly thick.

The treasure possessed an elegant grace. It seemed to have shed some of its former heft, appearing more slender and refined. It floated quietly in the lingering azure-and-yellow light, casting a tiny, palm-sized reflection of rolling hills and surging rivers beneath it, as if it were being presented on a priceless jade stand.

Li Ximing took it gently. It felt surprisingly heavy. After the refinement, Shichuan was slightly thinner but a couple of inches longer—about the width of six fingers.

'In my hand, it feels more like a thick-backed short blade.'

He couldn't help but admire his new spirit ruler. When he released his grip, the ruler obediently flipped over and fastened itself to his waist. Li Ximing scanned the crowd, their eyes all fixed on the new treasure. He smiled and commanded:

"Dismissed!"

The Heavenly Light flared, enveloping Chu Minglian and carrying him back toward Gardenia Scenery Mountain. The old man's gaze remained glued to Shichuan. As a weapons refiner, how could he not be moved when facing a spirit embryo he had played such a large part in creating? Tears of pure excitement welled in his eyes.

Li Ximing sat at a table. The gardenia blossoms on its surface dutifully scattered. He held Shichuan in his hands, infusing it with his Bright Yang divine ability.

'The tail is carved with the Yang Cusp, the head with High Radiance. It is painted with mountains and rivers, not inscribed with gods or spirits.'

Kui Qi had once mentioned that Shichuan was made from Stork River Azure Jade, a material that had long since vanished. Although Jade True had returned and jade stones were flourishing, he had heard of no one else obtaining this specific type. Jade was beautiful on its own; enhanced with Bright Yang spiritual extract, it was now utterly captivating. As his Bright Yang divine ability flowed through it, he steadily gained mastery over the artifact.

Shichuan's primary function was, fittingly, 'Reveal River'. When activated, it summoned a domain of mountain and river patterns in a radius of roughly forty-nine zhang—about the size of a large palace hall. Within this domain, he could push and entangle his enemies. The closer they were, the stronger the effect.

Its second ability was 'Monarch's Balance'. Shichuan contained a trace of discerning power. If an enemy's Dharma Art entered the domain, Shichuan could "measure" it, identifying its true power and dispelling any illusions.

The mountain and river patterns also had minor uses: following their flow as a shortcut, moving against them as a winding path, aiding cultivation, and seeing through an enemy's defenses. This power wasn't immense, and it overlapped somewhat with the abilities of the Heavenly Light between his brows, but one could never have too many wondrous abilities.

'Compared to the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, Shichuan is obviously inferior. Kui Qi was right: it has an excess of wondrous effects but a lack of true power. This isn't a primary weapon of the Imperial Clan. It's more of a ceremonial piece, meant to display their dignity, prioritizing elegance above all else.'

Although Shichuan was broadly classified as a Spiritual Artifact, it was still fundamentally a spirit embryo. He couldn't expect too much from it. The final result, however, left Li Ximing very satisfied.

'It was enhanced with a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual extract, after all. It won't be mediocre.'

He inspected it carefully, calculating on his fingers. A spirit embryo required constant nourishment from its cultivator's divine ability and mental effort. If it was separated from a Purple Mansion Realm master for too long, it would slowly lose its powers and degrade back into a mere dharma artifact.

Li Ximing had long suspected that many of the incredibly wondrous dharma artifacts from antiquity were actually degraded spirit embryos from fallen cultivators. His calculations now confirmed it. Thanks to the Purple Mansion Realm Bright Yang spiritual extract, if Shichuan were stolen and cut off from his divine ability, its power would wane, but it would take five full years to degrade completely. Even then, it would remain a dharma artifact far more wondrous than its original form.

Still, the loss would be disastrous. If he ever managed to retrieve it after that, refining it again on the Viewing Pavilion Platform would be useless. Unless he found another Bright Yang spiritual extract, even ten or twenty years of work would never restore it to its current power.

"So, the spirit embryo is complete. I borrowed connections, incurred debt, spent a priceless Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item I'd treasured for years, ran countless errands, and paid the price of standing by idly when the True Monarch came to the lake... But finally, my strength has taken another step."

This incredible leap in power in such a short time was partly due to his own luck, but also due to the intentional aid from the Supreme Yang Dao Daoist tradition, led by Kui Qi. When he thought about it, during the crisis where the Supreme Yang Dao Daoist tradition was ambushed by Buddhist cultivators and scrambling to contain the fallout in Jiangbei, he, Li Ximing, had secretly profited the most.

Shichuan could not be absorbed into his Heavenly Light like the Radiant Sun King's Halberd. He simply had to release his hand, and the spirit embryo of azure jade and bright yellow would fasten itself to his waist. Li Ximing felt a deep sense of satisfaction. He looked up at Chu Minglian.

"Senior Chu, you have worked hard these past few years. Setting aside the reward, both you and Qiuhu have done a great service for Moongaze!"

Chu Minglian had been sent by Ning Wan, so Li Ximing naturally couldn't forget Fairy Qiuhu. But Chu Minglian was even more emotional than he was, tears streaming down his face. "To have such an achievement in my lifetime is all thanks to Daoist Master seeing it through! How could I dare speak of payment!"

Li Ximing laughed heartily. They exchanged a few more pleasantries, and he was relieved to hear that Li Jiangqian had already prepared the reward. He dismissed the old refiner and sat back down, completely content, but his thoughts immediately returned to the north.

'Less than a year remains. I must continue my secluded cultivation of Dharma Arts. The fragment in the north absolutely cannot be lost. No matter who comes to claim it, no matter what injuries I suffer, no matter the cost... I *must* get my hands on it.'
