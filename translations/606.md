# Chapter 951: Tanyun

Li Qinghong flew all the way past Lake Xian, entered the sea, and crossed the line once marked by a True Monarch. The sky above darkened with thick clouds, and the purple hue of the inland seas could no longer be seen clearly.

The golden mountain in Kong Tingyun’s hand shimmered as it glided across the sea. Streaks of light flew by in the sky. When the two stopped at Splitreed Island, disciples from Profound Peak Gate promptly came to receive them.

Splitreed Island sat at the heart of the Shallow Sea. It had once been a stronghold of the Moonlight Origin Mansion, but after the Immortal Mansion secluded itself, various immortal sects from Jiangnan moved in. Gates and sects like Hengzhu Dao Gate and the Azure Pond Sect secured prime positions early on, while Profound Peak Gate, being a weaker latecomer, could only settle on the fringes.

The Azure Pond Sect was now administered by Li Xizhi. Kong Tingyun had deliberately made this stop to allow the aunt and nephew to meet, but also to use the opportunity to grow closer with Li Xizhi. However, when she sent someone to inquire, the response made her expression subtly change.

"Ning Hejing is the one guarding this place now?"

Kong Tingyun felt a faint sense of unease. She wasn’t deeply familiar with the Azure Pond Sect’s internal affairs, so she turned to explain everything in detail to Li Qinghong. The latter, however, showed no surprise at all.

"Ever since word of Chi Buzi spread and Si Yuanli began his seclusion, this was only a matter of time."

Removing Si Yuanli’s faction was inevitable. Hearing that Li Xizhi had already entered the Abyss confirmed he had a plan. Meanwhile, the Profound Peak Gate disciple hesitated slightly and said quietly, "Unfortunately, the timing was poor. The peak master of Changtian Peak went into the Abyss, and many sect documents weren’t handed over. The seals are missing. Lord Ning has already sat atop the peak for several days and sent multiple letters back to the sect."

"Pfft." The always perceptive Kong Tingyun instantly grasped the implications. She chuckled while inwardly thinking, There’s no need to guess. The Azure Pond Sect’s reef markets across the Eastern Sea are either under the Yangs, the Sis, or Li Xizhi’s people. Ning Hejing... hmph...

As Li Qinghong listened, her thoughts drifted to Chi Buzi, the Chi Family’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. She had once seen the so-called Chi Family Treasure Tree. Though she couldn’t fully understand everything she’d heard, one thing was clear... Chi Buzi likely harbored deep resentment toward Pristine Water, and his ambitions were even greater...

"He probably has truly given up on the Azure Pond Sect!" Kong Tingyun glanced at Li Qinghong, then turned to ask, "Did Ning Hejing bring anyone with him?"

The guard respectfully replied, "Most of the Ning Family remains within the sect. He brought back a few guest cultivators, all transferred from Yi Mountain City. There’s even someone from Mount Yue..."

"Someone from Mount Yue?" Li Qinghong raised her brows in mild surprise and asked, "Do you know his background? Do you know his name?"

The person quickly retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve, hesitating awkwardly before whispering, "He’s originally from Moongaze Lake. He once cultivated there, but... supposedly... his territory was seized, and he was later captured by Lord Xuanfeng and brought all the way back to Yi Mountain City. He’s a clever one and ended up joining the Ning Family. I heard that his name is Fei Luoya..."

The man spoke vaguely in her presence, but Kong Tingyun understood at once. The Moongaze Lake was now under Li Family control. Who else could have taken the Mount Yue man’s territory?

She lowered her gaze and said, "So there was an old enmity... no wonder he threw his lot in with Ning Hejing. Qinghong..."

As her probing gaze swept over, Li Qinghong was momentarily stunned in her heart, Who? Fei Luoya?!

How could Li Qinghong not recognize that name? He was an old veteran from Mount Yue, and a rather capable one at that. She had seen him multiple times, and every time, this old Mount Yue cultivator had come pleading for a way to survive...

Later, when Li Xuanfeng returned, he took him south to serve under the Ning Family. Who would have thought that after all the twists and turns, he would end up here?

Enmity? thought Li Qinghong.

Li Qinghong fell silent. There likely wasn’t any deep grudge between Fei Luoya and the Li Family, nor had there ever been any great favor owed. This so-called enmity was probably just a ploy to curry power. But it was hard to tell what that old man was truly thinking. One thing was clear, the old man was cunning and certainly had means. Ning Hejing would probably make great use of him.

Naturally, she wouldn’t undermine Fei Luoya for no reason, and simply sighed, "It’s true."

Kong Tingyun looked thoughtful, while Li Qinghong, inspired by this bit of information, quickly pieced together the arrangements between the Si and Chi factions. Her heart settled further.

Just then, the disciple from Profound Peak Gate said, "There is one more matter to report to the sect master."

"Speak."

Kong Tingyun prompted, and the man responded, "News from a few days ago says the sixteenth young master of the Golden Tang Gate broke through, mastering several advanced arts. He asked the sect master to step down and took the position himself... Now, the Golden Tang Gate is entirely under his control."

Kong Tingyun shook her head lightly and said, "That’s just their old tradition... There’s some coup or assassination every year. Back in the day, during the Li Xia affair, the Azure Pond Sect was flourishing, and the Golden Tang Gate leaned toward the Azure Pond Sect’s faction. Now that the Azure Pond Sect is declining, it’s only natural they shift toward the Golden Feather Sect’s side."

After thinking for a moment, she added, "I remember it was the Golden Feather Sect who supported Situ Nu long ago in killing his brother to ascend. Later, the Azure Pond Sect backed the first lineage in restoring power. This sixteenth young master who just rose again must be a descendant of Situ Nu..."

"Wise as always, Sect Master!" The man responded respectfully, "He is a surviving orphan from those days, named Situ Mo. He was born of a maidservant..."

"Situ Mo?" Kong Tingyun was truly taken aback and turned to look at Li Qinghong, only to find her expression equally conflicted. Kong Tingyun sighed softly and shook her head, saying, "So it’s him... Even when I fought him back then, I did not think he was an ordinary man. But I never imagined he had such a background!"

Li Qinghong sighed inwardly. She truly did know Situ Mo. His mother was once a woman from the Ji Family, and had harbored deep hatred ever since. She had even ambushed one of her own juniors. The Li Family had once laid a trap with Profound Peak Gate, but had failed to keep him.

Li Qinghong merely murmured, "He’s extremely cautious, quick-witted... not someone easy to deal with."

"Exactly." Kong Tingyun found herself somewhat troubled as well. She had crossed swords with this man during her first time stationed offshore and understood him well. Though he was a formidable enemy, she had to admit his abilities. She said, "I tried to trap him several times, and he evaded me each time... His level of caution and cunning is among the highest I’ve seen."

Li Qinghong even held back a deeper thought, My second uncle brought his bow to the Eastern Sea twice, but that guy hid like a turtle and refused to leave his island. Once he sent Mutuo, another time Situ Chen. Both times someone else took the fatal blow for him. He’s somehow held out until now.

After reviewing the intel, Kong Tingyun took her off the island again. This time they had a swift and steady spirit boat from Profound Peak Gate. The two sat calmly in the cabin as Kong Tingyun spoke softly, "Sister, there’s no need to worry. The Situ Family has only survived till now because their Purple Mansion Realm cultivator lingers in the Southern Sea. They pop up now and then, but never dare return to Jiangnan... Situ Mo wouldn’t dare make a move."

Li Qinghong nodded. She had some knowledge of how the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Golden Tang Gate had long been abroad, but she ultimately knew less than Profound Peak Gate, who had married into the sect.

She whispered, "I wonder which families have a grudge against Golden Tang Gate."

"It all goes back to Situ Tang." Kong Tingyun replied softly, "The Golden Tang Gate was founded by Situ Tang... He had extraordinary talent, and some even suspected he was blessed by fate itself... but his temperament was exceedingly domineering.

"At that time, Daoist Master Yuan Su was stationed at sea and went out to gather qi. Situ Tang barged into Yuan Su’s cave dwelling, killed the Three-Eyed Mount Tiao Beast, took its eye, and left unscathed. Even Daoist Master Qiushui was injured by him..."

"He also feuded with Yuming of the Shen Family and snatched a treasure from Daoist Yuan Xiu... Eventually, he turned south and clashed with Hengzhu Dao Gate... In short, he never thought of the consequences. By making enemies everywhere, he left the Golden Tang Gate in a constant state of awkwardness..."

Li Qinghong felt her heart gradually settle. Kong Tingyun smiled, shook her head and said, "It wasn’t until he angered a Dragon King in the sea and nearly died that he finally calmed down. Unfortunately, his lifespan was greatly reduced, and he never had the chance to reach the Golden Core Realm before his death."

The spirit boat sped south through the sky as the two conversed. The sea roared beneath them. After sitting for most of the day, they passed an island spewing black fire. The spirit boat suddenly shook with a loud rumble. Kong Tingyun looked up with a slight frown, lifted the curtain, and stepped out.

Li Qinghong looked up as well and saw roaring flames beneath them. The marketplace on the sea was in ruins, with several families seemingly locked in vicious battle. Sulfurous fire erupted as thick smoke billowed into the sky.

A few stray spell arts had struck the spirit boat, prompting Kong Tingyun to reveal herself. Her late Foundation Establishment Realm aura, combined with the radiance of her full Dharma robes, instantly frightened the surrounding cultivators into panic. Many dropped to their knees.

"Spare us, my lady! Spare us!"

"Where do you think you are? Do you all have no regard for your lives?" At her words, the cultivators who had unleashed the spells turned pale with terror and stammered in response. Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators flew in from the distance.

One of them recognized her at a glance and quickly bowed, speaking humbly, "Greet... Greetings, fairy of the Immortal Sect... Allow me to offer our apologies for this incident!"

He seized the troublemakers with one hand, intending to kill them on the spot, but Kong Tingyun waved him down. She paused to question them thoroughly but could not find any deeper cause.

Kong Tingyun frowned and observed them for a while. Once she was certain they had only caused unintentional harm, she let out a soft sigh. Meanwhile, Li Qinghong found the island oddly familiar. She lowered her gaze and quietly returned to the cabin.

After a few moments, Kong Tingyun reentered and sat across from her. She spoke softly, "This is Dongliu Island. It used to belong to a rather decent family... but their old ancestor failed his breakthrough and perished. A few of the elder generations also died, and they suddenly couldn’t hold such vast territory anymore.

"It’s a pity... Our Daoist Master once said that their ancestor had a fairly good chance of success, but he happened to run into Falling Water Rising Storm... and got washed to death by it..."

She poured tea for Li Qinghong and said gently, "Earlier, a few nearby families were besieging this place... The Han Family has a solid foundation, so it’s not so easy to topple them. They’ve apparently been fighting for over a year now."

Li Qinghong listened quietly, her eyes fixed on her teacup. After taking a sip, she asked, "How much farther is it from here to Zongquan?"

Kong Tingyun calculated for a moment and replied softly, "There should be another three or four days’ time."

"Alright," replied Li Qinghong, nodding. She quietly sipped her tea, already making mental calculations in her heart.

Crimson Reef Island.

Crimson Reef Island was the second-largest island in the Shallow Sea after Splitreed Island, but it was quite different. While Splitreed Island was a complete and unified landmass, Crimson Reef Island looked more like five or six large islands patched together.

The island was divided into East Reef and West Reef, a geographic and administrative split. The entire reef archipelago was split in two by a sea trench over five hundred kilometers wide. It was windless above and so vast that ordinary Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators couldn't even fly across it.

A woman in white stood on the sea dotted with jagged rocks. A frosty haze veiled her face, making her features indistinct. Her arms were folded across her chest.

Tianwan had been waiting here for several days. It wasn’t wasted time. Chi Buzi’s probing had forced Daoist Master Tanyun to show himself. Rather than feeling pleased, Tianwan had grown even more alert.

Tu Longjian...

Ever since the loss of the Six Ding Merging Fire Token, Tianwan had grown suspicious that Tanyun[1] from West Reef had kept a close eye on Tu Longjian ever since he secretly broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Chi Buzi’s recent stir-up confirmed for her that Tanyun had long since entered the Purple Mansion Realm. The realization chilled her and filled her with doubt.

The loss of the Six Ding Merging Fire Token was no accident; it must’ve been Tanyun’s doing! And so, new questions began to surge in her mind, Was Tu Longjian truly just a hypocrite dressed in righteousness?

The Daoist Master went over the possibilities in her mind and slowly shook her head.

"West Reef’s shadow has always loomed behind Tu Longjian... he must’ve wanted to protect Li Xijun, but the Six Ding Merging Fire Token was important enough for him to break his bottom line... and abandon pride if needed."

Linking it to how the token was lost, she nodded slightly and murmured, "The Merging Fire Token is no ordinary ancient artifact... it holds something within. Maybe a hidden trove, a cultivation technique, a lead to some ancient grotto heaven... or even Metallic Essence!"

"Husband..." Tianwan folded her arms over her chest, as if speaking across space to her long-vanished husband Guo Shentong. Her voice softened, "The dragon kin gave you the Six Ding Merging Fire Token... What kind of pact did you form with them? And what secrets did you hide within this spirit artifact... Tu Longjian... quite the name indeed!"

She stood quietly for a moment as a gust of fragrant wind swept in from the distance. It landed nearby and transformed into a man in sandalwood robes. He had arched brows and small eyes, but he was hunched over as he closely examined her.

Tianwan lowered her gaze and murmured, "Tanyun..."

"This old servant greets Madam!" Daoist Master Tanyun chuckled slyly, his eyes lacking the slightest respect.

Daoist Master Tianwan spoke softly, "Your spirituality is bound to him, so why not be honest with me... How is my husband now?"

"Eh..." Daoist Master Tanyun shook his head, replying mockingly, "Haven’t had contact in ages! Pardon me, Madam... There are far too many grotto heavens and secret realms in this world... What good is a mere strand of spirituality?"

Daoist Master Tianwan stared at him with quiet weight. Daoist Master Tanyun just laughed and said, "Why not ask the Golden Feather Sect instead? Those immortal sects are far-sighted and formidable... I’m sure they know something."

Tianwan remained silent for a while before speaking, "There’s no need to hide it. You handed the Six Ding Merging Fire Token to Tu Longjian... and Xu Xiao will surely die too...

"Why not keep this artifact in hand? Why give it to a bearer of fate like him? Could my husband be trapped in a grotto heaven... and needs this token carried inside to be rescued?"

As she spoke in a low voice, she carefully watched his expression and continued, "Or could it be..."

Her words were suddenly cut off by the demonic creature, whose tone had turned cold, "You used their lives to test me and my master. Guo Hongyao, Guo Hongkang, Guo Hong’er... How many direct descendants have already died? Tianwan! They were your children all the same!"
