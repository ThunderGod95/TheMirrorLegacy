# Chapter 1141: Greedy Snare of Profound Li

Li Ximing traveled across the sea for days, making haste. By the time the mountain teeming with demons—an overseas continent of devils—appeared before his eyes, he had already gained some insights into the Surrogate Body Ascension Art.

'This is a clever shortcut.'

He had examined the flask of Spring of Rebirth in his possession. Though precious and profound, it lacked the stability of an ordinary spiritual item. It was either a gift bestowed by a great power specifically for this technique, or it had emerged from a naturally formed treasured land, like the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew of the Nine Mounds. The Spring of Rebirth was simply far more noble. In the end, it was a path of expediency.

'As long as I can refine this Xuanmiao Great Treasury Spring of Rebirth into my Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, it will be imbued with the marvels of the Mysterious Valley, allowing it to resonate with the Surrogate Body Ascension Art and evade calamities.'

Though he had yet to master it, Li Ximing already understood its principles.

'This isn't like the alternate body's inherent ability to share damage. This can completely divert spells. At a critical moment, it can be a lifesaver, and it works even better when paired with a Valley Water divine ability or Spiritual Artifact… unless someone manages to shatter my Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body in a single blow, I can use the Surrogate Body Ascension Art indefinitely.'

Even if it were shattered, he could simply acquire another vial of the Xuanmiao Great Treasury Spring of Rebirth and start over. But having cultivated an external body for so many years, Li Ximing was self-aware enough to know that if a day came when his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was destroyed, he himself would be unlikely to survive.

Still, after reviewing it thoroughly, Li Ximing was extremely satisfied. He had a clear plan in his heart.

'Although the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire is mine to use, Minghuang risked life and limb to obtain it. Jiangqian's divine abilities are incredibly fast. One day, if he shows promise and reaches the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm before me, or even becomes a Great Daoist Master, the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire would be better suited for him.'

Given this, cultivating arts focused on evading disaster and nullifying spells had become Li Ximing's preferred choice. Obtaining the Surrogate Body Ascension Art bolstered his confidence.

'The art's description mentioned that nurturing it with several portions of the Spring of Rebirth can elevate the alternate body, cultivating a "Valley" within it for an even greater effect.'

Mulling this over, he landed on the demonic mountain, which, on the surface, appeared to be a paradise untouched by the mortal world. A disciple from the mountain led him to see Ping Yan.

This old, loyal servant of the Dragon-kin was bathed in demonic light, his cultivation having reached an extremely high level. Though he seemed to have just broken through to a new divine ability and was low on vital essence, his eyes were bright and full of confidence.

Li Ximing noticed the anomaly at a glance.

'What a formidable devil. He's actually cultivates Treasured Earth!'

Treasured Earth cultivators were rare; the only one he was familiar with in Jiangnan was Sumian. Li Ximing still remembered the demonic embryo in the man's possession. By his calculations, Sumian had either failed and perished, or had been reborn by now.

'That was a Qi Stone Demonic Embryo!'

When Li Ximing had his breakthrough, he hadn't understood how potent a Qi Stone Demonic Embryo was. Now, with his broadened horizons and his own external body, he knew it was a treasure of Proclaimation Earth. In the Marvelous Scroll of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, it was considered a superior-grade embryo for a Dharma Body!

'That Sumian really lucked out!'

He pushed the thought aside. A monk was already waiting beside the old devil. A pure light enveloped him, and his skin was as fine as a youth's, giving him the air of an enlightened master. He sat calmly at the table, his face heavy with contemplation.

'A Maha with a profound divine ability…'

Li Ximing clasped his hands together. Though suspicious, he spoke politely.

"And you are…?"

The monk rose and smiled.

"I am Mingmeng, senior brother to Minghui. He was gravely injured in the conflict between the north and south, and his Dharma Body has yet to recover. He dares not venture out, so I have come in his stead!"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He took a seat without ceremony and with a light wave of his hand, several golden artifacts materialized in a pile, covered by a worn kasaya that radiated a brilliant light.

Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing had achieved much in the past few years. While a large portion of the Enlightened Artifacts they had seized had not ended up in their hands, the pile here was still noteworthy, to say nothing of Vast Cicada's dazzling old kasaya. Mingmeng examined it carefully and sighed in admiration.

"King Wei's divine abilities are vast indeed!"

Li Ximing watched him take stock of the treasures and shook his head.

"The spiritual fire your junior brother traded us last time was a foul, miasmic mess! I'm still dealing with the fallout! It's truly tiresome. Spiritual resources are good, but spiritual items are better. I only hope you have some cleaner goods on hand, fellow Daoist."

Minghui's offer had been generous, but Li Ximing had to press his advantage. The monk before him was unfazed and smiled.

"You speak the truth, Benefactor! This humble monk also came prepared."

He was seen taking a scroll from his sleeve. It rested on a cloth of gold silk, which he held carefully in his palm as he spoke in a low voice.

"My Lotus Temple has long been established in the central plains and possesses some heritage. Within this… is a technique from the old Wei palace. I trust you will be interested, fellow Daoist."

"This scroll is called the 'Scroll of Accomplishment and Fulfillment.' It is an old scroll that belonged to King Shouyi of the former Wei State."

Li Ximing's heart skipped a beat. He scanned it with his spiritual sense, but his brow furrowed.

"What kind of technique is this? As far as I know, the Lotus Temple isn't that ancient, and the Way of Joyful Bliss was not among those who entered the capital during the Liang era… From its appearance, it lacks any sense of antiquity. It doesn't look like an original… more like a copy… You lack sincerity, fellow Daoist."

Mingmeng knew that a copied version was hardly convincing and even carried the suspicion of having key parts altered. If the sect hadn't given him this very item, he wouldn't have bothered presenting it. He sighed.

"There's something you may not know, fellow Daoist… In the past, during the Liang era's Immortal-Buddhist Debate, the Liang Emperor showed favoritism. The Immortals won by a margin of six victories, leaving all the Buddhist masters resentful. Later, Emperor Zhao fell, and Emperor Zhaoli welcomed the Seven Aspects of the Buddhist bone relic. The very next year, the Immortal-Buddhist Debate was held again…"

At these words, Li Ximing raised an eyebrow, a hint of disdain in his eyes.

"I assume the Buddhist cultivators won this time."

Mingmeng silently shook his head.

"It is shameful to admit, but the Immortal cultivators had already lost four consecutive matches, and no one else dared to take the stage. Who would have thought… who would have thought…"

He said awkwardly,

"Two more people appeared on the stage. They sat there, drinking wine with downcast eyes. I heard one was a direct disciple of the True Monarch of Mount Luoxia, named Wei Kan. The other was the former sect master of the Yue Cultivating Sect and also a direct disciple of a True Monarch, named Nian Hao…"

"And so, we didn't dare to win after that. The original of this item was lost to the prestigious Feng family at that time…"

Li Ximing frowned but reluctantly accepted this explanation. He took the scroll, looked at the glittering golden characters, and asked,

"What does it contain?"

Mingmeng, full of confidence, smiled.

"King Shouyi was the man who drove the Wei Emperor's chariot and wielded his blade. This 'Secret Art of Shouyi's Attainment' was a technique he developed by observing the Wei Emperor moving through army formations. It is a family treasure… I am sure King Wei… will have a use for it."

Li Ximing now understood where the monk's confidence came from. He frowned and remained silent, but Mingmeng continued softly.

"Even if King Wei cannot use it… this item is an heirloom of the Situ family… Who knows what use it might have? Situ Huo serves under the Great Song. I imagine he would be quite tempted by this."

At these words, Li Ximing's pupils widened slightly.

'Situ Huo? He's from King Shouyi's line? Him?'

Although Li Ximing had heard that the Situ family was once a great clan in Guanlong, the aristocratic families there had changed hands several times over the generations! He had never imagined that Situ Huo could be connected to the Wei Emperor. His shock was genuine, but he put on a smile.

"The man disowns his own kin. You expect him to acknowledge his ancestors?"

Mingmeng laughed heartily and clapped his hands in approval.

"Daoist Master must know that while these Enlightened Artifacts are valuable, not a single one is complete. Furthermore, our Enlightened Artifacts are not made with materials as precious as Spiritual Artifacts and can hardly compare to such an ancient secret art. I have come with the utmost sincerity. Firstly, I hope King Wei will look after the people of my Lotus Temple… Secondly… my purpose concerns that bronze basin in your possession, Daoist Master."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing's expression remained unchanged as he smiled.

"Although this bronze basin has traces of the Buddhist Dao, it is a Spiritual Artifact. It cannot be exchanged for a mere secret art or two."

A troubled look appeared on Mingmeng's face.

"You misunderstand, Daoist Master."

He said only this:

"This basin has a long history. Though its quality is not high, its origins are extraordinary. It is an item from the Dams-Goat Temple Palace, established by the Buddhists' Celestial Participant of the Dams!"

Li Ximing knew of the Dams-Goat Temple Palace. He also knew from Li Zhouwei that the figure known as Master Canyan to Immortal cultivators was the same person the Buddhists revered as the Celestial Participant of the Dams. A flicker of understanding crossed his mind.

'Canyan is the originator of the modern Buddhist tradition, which means this bronze basin… is indeed a Spiritual Artifact!'

As he pondered, Mingmeng said with a solemn expression,

"The founder of the Way of Emptiness was but an unknown figure under the Dams-Goat Daoist Tradition. This bronze basin was his Spiritual Artifact. Its quality may be poor, but it carries great karmic weight. Therefore… the Way of Emptiness covets it greatly!"

A thought flashed through Li Ximing's mind, and he asked suspiciously,

"You are truly kind-hearted, fellow Daoist!"

As he saw it, there was no reason for Mingmeng to tell him this. Wasn't he just making trouble for himself?

Hearing his words, Mingmeng shook his head.

"I have no intention of trading for this item, nor does the Way of Joyful Bliss wish to interfere in the matters between the Ways of Emptiness and Great Desire. I am only reminding you, Daoist Master… that the Way of Great Desire has already been working in secret to deceive you and trade for this item. Once it falls into their hands, it will surely create a formidable enemy for King Wei!"

Li Ximing's expression turned grave, and he fell silent.

'It seems… their people have already approached that master and disciple pair on Overlook Peak!'

He turned the monk's words over in his mind, finding that the logic and interests involved were sound. He recalled Cheng Qian's expression and didn't think he seemed like someone who would aid the enemy; it was more likely he had been kept in the dark as well. After a long silence, he finally spoke.

"Thank you for the warning!"

Unlike Minghui, Mingmeng did not possess such a heavy sycophantic streak. Seeing he had his answer, he nodded firmly, rose to his feet, and smiled slightly. With a surge of dharma power, the characters on the scroll became visible one by one. Li Ximing scanned them from top to bottom, reading through the text once. It was exceedingly obscure. He frowned and looked at Mingmeng.

The monk pressed his palms together, his voice sincere and trustworthy.

"When it comes to the Bright Yang, who can surpass King Wei? Trying to pull a fast one here would be suicide for this humble monk."

Li Ximing nodded, listening as the monk continued,

"My senior brother was ordered by Mount Dayang to guard the riverbank. My apologies for the repeated disturbances! This humble monk has urgent matters to attend to, so I will take my leave!"

He departed crisply. Li Ximing put away the items and considered the matter carefully. He hid the bronze basin and gradually formed a plan.

'This settles it… After I finish refining those few batches of pills, I'll deliver them to the two of them. Then I should enter seclusion and focus on my spell arts.'

Just as he was preparing to leave the mountain, he found that devil, Ping Yan, waiting for him before the hall. He was smiling as he looked at Li Ximing and said in a low voice,

"Daoist Master… His Majesty has concluded his affairs and has a message for you to deliver to King Wei!"

Li Ximing instantly grew vigilant, but his face remained polite as he nodded.

"May I ask which royal highness?"

"From the White Dragon Shrine, Dragon King Beihai."

"Please speak!"

The old devil gave him a heavy look and said,

"King Wei once replied to the Dragon King that since Great Ancestor Wei was harmed by Luoxia, the Dragon-kin, as millennium-old allies, should be able to distinguish right from wrong. Now that King Wei has reached the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, he should honor his old promise."

Li Ximing stared straight at him, a bitter taste forming in his mouth. He asked,

"What does the Dragon King mean by this?"

Ping Yan bowed.

"When King Wei's forces reach the Ji River, the Dragon King will come personally to discuss this matter with him. We hope King Wei remembers that while the Dragon-kin have not intervened in the conflict between north and south, we—have expectations of him."

The Daoist Master in the white and gold robes stared for a long time before saying in a deep voice,

"I will deliver the message."

…

Moongaze Lake.

A gentle breeze drifted over the lake. The sound of hurried footsteps echoed everywhere, and plumes of pale white smoke swirled between the grand halls. Li Jiangzong rushed down the steps, picking up a jade tablet once more to ask,

"Have the orders been passed down? Are the lamps in every location lit?"

The youth before him had a powerful build, and his golden eyes were brilliant, radiating a majesty that was at once soft and commanding. He nodded.

"Uncle, there's no need to worry. I have already asked everywhere."

But Li Jiangzong still appeared anxious.

"This ritual is the first time in a hundred years that all four lineages have gathered to honor the ancestral temple. Your great father gave the order himself. There can be no mistakes!"

How could Li Jiangzong not be anxious? He had managed the household for many years, and rituals had always been of the utmost importance. For Li Zhouwei to personally summon him and solemnly entrust this matter to him—this was a first!
He checked the reports from each hall one last time before letting out a long sigh of relief. He solemnly changed his robes, lit incense, and performed nine prostrations. Only then did he turn to Li Suihuan and say with great gravity,

"I'm leaving the island in your hands. I'm going to the inner sanctum to see King Wei. Wait for me to return with his decree!"

The youth simply nodded, as calm and steady as ever, which was reassuring. Li Jiangzong left the hall and hurried into the inner sanctum, only to find that the old man who usually stood guard at the entrance was gone.

This made him even more nervous. He walked to the front of the great hall, took a deep breath, and bowed.

"Junior Jiangzong requests an audience!"

"Creeak…"

The hall doors opened a crack, and the fragrance of candlelight wafted out. He vaguely saw a glimmer of gold light illuminating the towering flights of stairs. Countless lamps arranged throughout the hall were reflected in bronze mirrors, sparkling and brilliant, as if he had stepped into a realm of ten thousand golden suns.

"The rites are complete."

It was the old master's voice.

Li Xuanxuan had just been invited here and was sitting before the hall doors. After Li Jiangzong, who had come to report, departed, a torrent of Radiant Fire poured down. Only then did a youth with golden eyes and crimson robes materialize in the great hall, his expression grave.

Tears of excitement glistened in Li Xuanxuan's old eyes. He had been suspicious when he heard news of the ritual, and his heart had pounded with anticipation. Seeing him now, he was utterly satisfied, sighing with emotion.

'They've all made us proud… This "first ritual in a century with all four lineages gathered"… it was all for this good child's Azure Talisman!'

Though Ting Province's population had surpassed a million, an Azure Talisman was simply too precious. Neither Li Zhouwei nor Li Jiangqian had slacked in the slightest. They didn't even dare to go to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Under the pretext of the "Grand Centennial Ceremony of the Four Lineages," they had mobilized the entirety of Moongaze Lake.

As countless streams of invisible golden light drifted up and through the air, the black urn on the altar began to shake, faintly emitting cries for mercy. King Wei, standing to the side, showed no hesitation, his expression unflinching as he directly connected with the divine mystery!

"Om…"

An invisible color flashed past, and the cries for mercy abruptly ceased. Li Jiangqian, prostrating in the center, felt his ears ring as a sheet of white light seemed to explode before his eyes. A brilliant radiance surged into him. His Shengyang Acupoint felt intensely cool as the white light flooded in!

His divine ability, 'Great Scripture of Radiance', as if smelling some supremely attractive treasure of heaven and earth, began to stir frantically. His cultivation began to climb at a visible rate. Li Jiangqian had been waiting for this moment and immediately activated his spiritual sense to lock down the divine ability!

The divine ability was instantly trapped in place, but azure-mist-like dharma power continued to surge forward, condensing into a thick azure cloud beneath it. Li Jiangqian, however, felt a cold sweat break out all over his body.

When Li Zhouwei had condensed his azure cloud, he had done so under the condition that his divine ability was maxed out and could advance no further. But Li Jiangqian clearly had a divine ability that was as vacant as an empty pool, yet he prevented the azure cloud from flowing into it. The two forces clashed, creating a deadlock.

Li Zhouwei had been watching from the side. Seeing his face covered in cold sweat and his complexion changing, he was just about to intervene.

At that very moment, a cool sensation welled up. The Talisman Seed itself leaped out in the nick of time. The rolling azure cloud instantly condensed, transforming into a talisman that floated down!

Li Jiangqian let out a long sigh, the cold sweat vanishing. But he had no time to think. The dim darkness in his mind was torn open, and streaks of crimson appeared, outlined in crimson-gold, a dazzling display of colors!

Greedy Snare of Profound Li!

This talisman senses the Celestial Yang and seizes destiny. It inherits the Dao of heavenly separation and plunder, manifests the light of the Celestial Yang's universal radiance, elevates one's innate nature, and proclaims the radiance. Wherever life-mandate is sensed and connected, brilliance will be born, and the true essence will be seized!

Li Jiangqian felt his eyes grow heavy, as if flames were erupting within them. His vision went dark and then bright again, filled with infinite streams of Li-Light. He was speechless for a long time, unable to hold back a grunt!

That single exhalation was like a storm of Radiant Fire, extinguishing all the lamps in the great hall at once. Everything went dark, leaving only his open eyes, golden and crimson, shining with extreme brightness.

He raised his head, trembling slightly, and looked at his father.

"This Azure Talisman… it's a great Dao of sensing life-mandate and seizing the spirit of others!"

Li Zhouwei was slightly surprised. He shielded Li Xuanxuan behind him from the rolling Radiant Fire and listened as Li Jiangqian spoke with a trace of excitement.

"It contains the Dao of heavenly separation and plunder, and of the Celestial Yang's universal radiance. When I consume any Radiant Fire spiritual item, besides the nourishment it provides, it will also subtly increase my own life-mandate. This is what is meant by 'elevating one's innate nature'!"

"This Greedy Snare of Profound Li prioritizes the sensing of Radiant Fire life-mandate… It is a continuous source of perception, and it can also seize and devour the life-mandates of others. Although I can't make them my own, I can secretly use them to aid my own cultivation…"

His words caused the expressions of the two elders to change. But Li Jiangqian quickly changed the subject.

"And this Talisman Qi is endlessly mutable. It can serve as a reference for my own life-mandate perception! A foundation to rely upon for cultivating my life-mandate!"

"This means that if I cultivate a technique like the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method, not only will my cultivation speed be terrifyingly fast, but when I cast it… I will be sensing with double the life-mandate! And as long as I incorporate items into my three mansions, or even the fire mansion in my chest—a total of four mansions—they will all be within the perception of the Greedy Snare of Profound Li…"

He slowly raised his head, having an immediate realization.

"The most direct manifestation… will be in the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire, which is the result of the 'Great Scripture of Radiance' sensing life-mandate!"

He raised his hand again. The archaic, golden Radiant Fire began to swirl once more, but its radiance was several times more brilliant than before, blazing in the great hall and spreading an aura of destruction.

"Originally, this heart-fire sensed my own life-mandate. Now, it senses both mine and that of the Greedy Snare of Profound Li. Its power has already surged. In the future, with the spiritual fires I place in my four mansions, it will surely rise to another level! And as my skill in sensing life-mandate improves, these advantages will be magnified even further!"

Li Zhouwei listened, his eyes burning, clearly filled with ideas. He pondered for a moment, while Li Jiangqian considered.

"Some minor abilities for divining and manipulating fate will be helpful for calculations and avoiding schemes, quite useful in fights and other matters, but they aren't crucial… Elevating my innate nature is too extravagant to be worth mentioning. Just this heightened perception of life-mandate… is already an advantage that could not be greater!"

Li Zhouwei was silent for a long time, apparently thinking about something. He raised his eyebrows.

"Don't forget… you still have two Life Divine Abilities you haven't mastered!"

Li Jiangqian nodded happily. Li Zhouwei said in a deep voice,

"Life-mandate perception… Go and cultivate the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method immediately. Do not delay for a single moment!"

Li Jiangqian saw the look on his face and suppressed his joy. Li Zhouwei gave him a solemn warning.

"Before you make a move in the North-South conflict, you must raise your proficiency in the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method to a certain level! Only then can you explain why your Southern Brightness Heart-Fire is so powerful! It will prevent people from becoming needlessly suspicious…"

Li Jiangqian's expression changed slightly. His very life and safety were at stake. He immediately nodded, bowed, and without a moment's delay, vanished into the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

The great hall instantly dimmed, leaving only the toppled and shattered lamp stands, broken apart by the Radiant Fire. Li Zhouwei helped the old man up, only to see Li Xuanxuan standing speechless, looking somewhat shocked. He raised his head, his voice aged.

"I've watched for so many years, and I know the Talisman Qi of both seniors and juniors… It's often said they are related to one's character and fate…"

"This one… is the most venomous I have ever seen."

…

The Western Sea.

The seawater churned, its shimmering light ever-changing.

An expanse of Weak Water rose, swirling and shifting. Nestled within it was a small island, its waters glistening, its scenery beautiful.

Gloom Mountain, also known as Fenglin Isle, was an old haunt of the Weak Water demons. Located in the Abyss of Weak Water, it was now greatly weakened but still possessed some of its former glory. Even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator couldn't be certain of flying freely here.

Yet in this dark, bottomless place of the Underworld, a point of azure light burned brightly. A figure stood silently in the Great Void, a pair of placid jade-green eyes holding an icy chill.

'They refuse to come out, no matter what… It seems they really do have someone backing them. Quite perceptive.'

But there was no frustration in his gaze, only a dangerous resolve. The string of ink-jade beads in his hand rolled twice as he pondered.

'I've waited this long, and still no one has come to see me. The Way of Joyful Bliss has either abandoned them, or… they don't have the spare hands.'

The only one Chi Buzi was slightly wary of was that Jinlian.

'That fellow has been tempered through at least eight lifetimes and comes from an Immortal cultivator background. He is versed in both Immortal and Buddhist arts, one of the few truly capable ones… And his personality is bizarre. It's best not to get into a fight with him…'

His expression flickered for a moment. A rolling raincloud rose beneath his feet, lifting him up. A shifting light of clear and turbid azure swirled around his body as his gaze fell upon the great array enveloping the island.

Clear Dusk Rain.

Within the dark clouds, the faint sound of a treasured cauldron shifting could be heard. A rolling azure radiance immediately drifted down, growing more intense, soon covering the entire island. The light on the array flickered continuously, making a sizzling sound.

Seeing his blatant aggression, a commotion erupted within the great array. A torrent of divine abilities surged forth like converging waves of water, condensing and shifting, its light shimmering.

Dwelling in Winter's Depth!

The light of this Mansion Water was exceptionally strange. It surged upward and transformed, carrying a piercing cold and a towering killing intent. A vast domain manifested, dissipating the descending fine rain. An angry voice echoed faintly.

"Chi Buzi!"

"Your divine ability is powerful, beyond our reach. We will take a step back. Name any Mansion Water spiritual item or resource you desire! Why must you insist on taking the lives of my clansmen!"

The man in azure clothes showed no change in expression. He simply turned his hand over, revealing the string of ink-jade-like beads. Instantly, sheets of pure light transformed into goose-feather snow, mingling with the wind and rain, and came crashing down!

"Boom!"

The sky flickered between light and dark, but the snow grew thicker. The two divine abilities repeatedly clashed, but the light of the Mansion Water was forcefully pushed back into the array by the Pristine Water. The azure-clothed man strolled through the air as if in a garden, speaking coolly.

"Merging Dawn Abyss, Dwelling in Winter's Depth, you've brought out both… Your Fenglin Isle's Dao lineage is complete… surely you have more than just these two, right?"

He raised an eyebrow.

"I'd like to see Morning Cold Rain."

The Mansion Water below grew more agitated, but it couldn't stop the rolling azure rain from falling on the array. This continued for dozens of days. No matter how powerful the array was, large ripples eventually appeared.

Just then, a sound came from the Great Void. A monk stepped out, his expression grave. The yellow umbrella in his hand snapped open, floating up to block the streams of Pristine Water. He pressed his palms together and said in a deep voice,

"Show mercy, my lord!"

This shout was like a clap of thunder, stirring the murky Weak Water. It was Mingmeng, who had rushed to the scene!

The azure-robed Daoist Master raised an eyebrow and looked at him with a smile.

"Jinlian didn't come himself. I wonder what kind of trash he sent instead."

Mingmeng did not get angry. He clasped his hands together and said respectfully,

"I am Mingmeng of the Lotus Temple. I have come on my master's orders to resolve this karmic entanglement with you, Great Daoist Master."

Chi Buzi laughed.

"You Buddhist cultivators are amusing. When you yourselves are moved by greed to seize treasures, you call it 'karmic affinity' and attack without cause. Now that you are coveted by others, you know how to speak of 'resolving karma.' It seems you get to define what's good and bad in every situation."

His expression was casual as he spread his hands.

"The Mansion Water demon beast below has a karmic affinity with me. Since you all love fulfilling karmic destinies, you should just give it to me. I won't make things difficult for you. I only want the little one, not the old one… You can leave the old thing for your master to use as a mount!"

Chi Buzi had always been sharp-tongued. Hearing this, Mingmeng's face became unsightly.

"Mingmeng has come on orders and is willing to offer a measure of Cavern Essence."

The sky was silent. The only answer he received was the pounding rain.

Mingmeng's expression darkened. He gritted his teeth and raised his head.

"Two measures!"

Seeing the azure figure in the sky standing as if he hadn't heard, Mingmeng's face shifted between green and white. The light from his umbrella grew more intense as he said in a deep voice,

"Great Daoist Master, you had best think this through! The three of us stand with the protection of the array. It will not be broken so easily. My master has already completed his eighth lifetime. Great Daoist Master, do not push your luck!"

"Oh?"

The Pristine Water in the sky grew thicker, and Chi Buzi's gloomy voice drifted down.

"Do you take me for a castrated lineage like the Upper Rite? Or a weak position like the Cold Qi? Of the glories of Pristine Water, only Guo Shentong's Merging Fire can suppress it. Do you think you're Wei Xuanyin? How dare you speak to me like that…"

In a single thought, the verdant rain falling from the sky became terrifying. The umbrella in Mingmeng's hand emitted a sound as if it were on the verge of breaking. He was horrified.

'What terrifying Dao-Profundity… He passed the Purple Mystery stage far too early!'

It wasn't that Mingmeng had never heard of Chi Buzi's reputation. Jiangnan had produced a host of geniuses over the years, and while Chi Buzi's cultivation speed was frightening, it could only be ranked in the upper-middle among them…

But if one were to judge by aptitude for cultivating the Dao, based on the speed at which he passed the Purple Mystery stage… this man was definitely in the top three!

Once a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator passed the Purple Mystery stage, their divine abilities would surge, and their connection with heaven and earth would become more intimate, not to mention that Pristine Water had two Life Divine Abilities! Chi Buzi's Dao-Profundity now… was even more terrifying!

What horrified him even more was that this heavily falling Pristine Water… had taken on a different quality, one that was constantly dispelling the divine mysteries around his body, causing his protective light to shatter with a cracking sound…

'What is this? A divine ability? A spell art?'

Before he could think further, the bronze cauldron in the sky came crashing down!

"BOOM!"

The expected heavy blow never came. All the raindrops in the world froze in an instant. The rolling divine mysteries climbed and shattered in mid-air, dissolving into pure light. Chi Buzi finally straightened up, the smile on his face fading.

In the western sky, countless streams of brilliant light were rising. A path of gold, like a long flight of stairs, unfurled. Various wondrous pagodas could be seen everywhere. Rainbow-hued pools rippled with tranquil harmony. The scent of sandalwood rolled forth, pouring down like milk and spreading across the vast expanse of the sky.

A look of joy appeared in Mingmeng's eyes.

"Master!"

A monk stood upon the endless steps. He was of medium height with fair skin, simply draped in a translucent Zen robe. His face was holy as he stared quietly at Chi Buzi. Within his pupils, lotus flowers bloomed and folded, one after another.

'Eighth-Lifetime Maha, Jinlian!'

In the current world, once a Maha reached their ninth lifetime, they would almost always go to the Chandana Forest to prepare to become a Dharma Master and no longer walk the mortal world. An eighth lifetime—was practically the highest limit for a Maha to act in the human realm!

It was equivalent to a perfected divine ability!

The lotuses in his eyes bloomed and withered, revealing all sorts of illusions that traveled through the air, washing away all the rain in the world. In the next moment, they were about to fall upon the Great Daoist Master, but a thick, rolling light rose up, turbid as ink, and enveloped the man in azure.

Though they were clearly right before each other, it was as if they were separated by ten thousand miles. The dew and the brilliant light that filled the sky constantly collided, turning into a mix of azure and gold. Chi Buzi narrowed his eyes, and a strange thought suddenly occurred to him.

'What an infuriatingly punchable face. Strange… I've never met anyone so grating.'

All the colors converged and descended. Mingmeng felt no joy, only a bitter sigh as he stood silently in place, his face full of worry.

As expected, a holy chant rolled across the sky. A hint of pity appeared on the monk's sacred face, and his lips parted slightly.

"Chi Buzi… you orphan… Since you've made yourself a dog for the dragons, why don't you go lick their tails? What gives you the nerve to provoke your grandpa?"

'I knew it!'

The holy chant traveled across the sky. The two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the array stood frozen. Mingmeng lowered his head in shame, not daring to look at the face of the jade-eyed devil.

'Revered One above… Your venerable self may have mastered Buddhist Shame, but we haven't… You… please show some restraint!'

Chi Buzi, who was always cool and detached, was stunned speechless for the first time. His pair of green eyes swept over the monk's holy face, and he shook his head.

"So this is how the Way of Joyful Bliss is cultivated."

He faintly sensed something and immediately had his Life Divine Ability sweep through his body, severing the connection of vital energy. He did not meet the man's gaze and instead said coolly,

"Jinlian, hand over the Profound Scale of the Sunken Manor, and I will not kill your disciples."

The sky was silent, but a faint tremor could be heard. The monk before him had already manifested a heaven-spanning Dharma Body. A face of joy and bliss stretched across the sky, its holy chant shaking the heavens, its brilliant light illuminating the Weak Water!

"Chi… you dog!"

Hearing this, Chi Buzi felt his insides churn, a burning heat rising. He narrowed his eyes, raised his hand, and grew ruthless!

'I'll see for myself what a stupid, depraved piece of trash like you is capable of!'
