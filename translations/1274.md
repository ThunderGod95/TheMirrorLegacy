# Chapter 1274: Assisting Providence

Li Zhouwei moved like the wind. Emerging from the hall, he strode across the heavenly light and headed east. Li Que'wan, seeing that Li Jiangqian had remained behind, rode the wind to join him, saying hesitantly, "Your Majesty... I fear the arrangements for the Yu Clan will be difficult."

Li Que'wan had secretly observed the Yu Clan's mystic realm—its Dao Lineage was inextricably linked to Profound Qi, and it seemed to be a remnant of the Great Liang!

One had to understand that the Tao Clan's Governing Yang Grotto, the Qiao Clan's Bountiful Yang Grotto, and even the most prosperous Wei Clan's Mountain's Edge Hall had all belonged to the Wei-Li in those days. Otherwise, why would the Marquis of Yincheng from the Governing Yang Grotto have gone to such lengths to forcefully seal his mystic realm? When the Great Wei collapsed, these locally stationed clans surrendered to the Qi Emperor and seized the realms for their own use. Broadly speaking, they belonged to the Bright Yang; narrowly speaking, they belonged to the Wei-Li family alone!

Of course, the world's treasures have always belonged to the capable, their ownership ever-flowing, and one rarely dwelled on their original masters. Yet the Great Wei also hailed from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition. Li Zhouwei, as the White Qilin, the purest-blooded of the Wei-Li, and the favored of the Bright Yang, was now the one with the mightiest fist. He was taking back these mystic realms one by one, not seizing whatever he pleased, but only reclaiming what was his. Naturally, no one dared to utter a word of dissent.

As for the Yu Clan of Ruzhou, firstly, their mystic realm was not of the Bright Yang Dao. Secondly, the old Daoist Master Yu Xi had rendered meritorious service in the great war and would be of great use later. The Yu Clan had already silently allowed their mystic realm to fall in cooperation with Li Zhouwei's plans. In Li Que'wan's eyes, a strategy of appeasement was undoubtedly the best course of action!

Her meaning, Li Zhouwei naturally understood. He clasped his hands behind his back and moved forward, smiling.

"The Yu Clan is of considerable use, and my subsequent plans will require Yu Xi. You can set your mind at ease."

The two of them rode the Great Void onward. They soon saw a rolling, undulating darkness, and a stretch of Valley Water manifested within the Great Void. An old man was standing there, his hands clasped behind his back, his expression complex, and his gaze like lightning fixed upon a certain point.

It was Yu Xi!

And at the place his gaze was fixed, a middle-aged man sat cross-legged within a green radiance, his hands pressed together in a polite gesture. His body, however, completely and flawlessly blocked the restriction in the Great Void behind him.

Xuanwei had reached an accord with Li Zhouwei and had come to deal with the Yu Clan's mystic realm, Hall of Assisting Providence!

With him standing guard, not even Yu Xi could enter. Although the old man was anxious, he couldn't afford to stand against both the Tao and Li clans simultaneously. For a moment, he seemed less rushed and simply stood guard alongside him.

Upon seeing Li Zhouwei appear, he was half joyful and half uneasy. He clasped his fist and said in a low voice, "Greetings, King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Daoist Master Yu, you arrived quite quickly."

Yu Xi gave a bitter smile.

"My Yu Clan's ancestral shrine is within the mystic realm; with its fall, I am disquieted. Now that the cultivators have gone to defend Liangchuan and have repelled the people of Zhao, the situation has stabilized. This Yu was burning with anxiety, so I took a brief moment to come."

He avoided mentioning spiritual items or resources, choosing to speak of the ancestral shrine instead. Li Zhouwei strode forward and said casually,

"Let this not be a precedent."

The words made the old man shudder slightly. He nodded silently. Seeing that King Wei had exchanged greetings with Daoist Master Xuanwei and was in no hurry to enter, he called out softly,

"Daoist friend Yang!"

"Xuancai is here..."

Yang Xuancai had been waiting in the Great Void for some time, gloating over the ruins of the Yu family's fallen mystic realm. She never imagined this King Wei would suddenly summon her. She hurried forward, her delicate face filled with apprehension, and simply stood there in silence.

Only then did Li Zhouwei turn his gaze to Yu Xi. The old Daoist Master seemed slightly wary, standing there in contemplation. The King of Wei said faintly,

"I have heard that your two families have suddenly become embroiled in a grudge. Let this king hear of it."

Yu Xi was startled at first. Seeing Yang Xuancai lower her head without a word, he immediately sneered,

"It was a truly 'great deed' initiated by Daoist Master Yang!"

The old Daoist Master's tone was icy.

"The Yu and Yang families coexist in Ruzhou, separated by a tributary of the Ru River. In the early years, we were on good terms, but suspicion arose because of the early wars with Zhao, and over the years, resentment gradually festered. When Senior Yang was still alive, he wished to mend our relations. The Yang Clan was to return Forbidden Water City, and the Yu Clan would gift the Three Pang Ridge. However, because a cultivator in Forbidden Water City was in the middle of a breakthrough at the time, the exchange couldn't proceed. We made an agreement with Daoist Master Yang to redraw the boundaries later..."

"But after Senior Yang fell and you achieved your divine ability, you broke that promise!"

Yang Xuancai had considered what he might say. Back when she first sensed Yu Xi's killing intent, she had been full of confusion, unable to comprehend it. But hearing this, her eyes widened in astonishment.

"A single city, a single piece of land, how could it come to this! My elder brother fell during his breakthrough in Forbidden Water City and transformed into a river. I did not wish to disturb the waters of his transformation and even went to your esteemed clan to offer my apologies. How could it lead to you wanting me dead!"

Yu Xi fell silent for a moment. Seeing all eyes on him, he heaved a long sigh.

"It is fine to speak of it now... Many years ago, when the old Daoist Master of the Tao Clan fell, a mountain and a pool emerged in Yinling, presenting a magnificent sight. But the clans of Luoxia are all closely connected. The earth veins trembled, causing a change in my family's grand array. The earth veins leaked away, the break occurring right at Forbidden Water City..."

"Without that place, I cannot mend the flaw in the grand array! But if I had explained it to you clearly, it would have revealed that the key to the Yu family's array lies in Forbidden Water City... Once I die, you would surely go and excavate the earth veins—you are an array master; I dared not even mention it!"

"You all know that my Yu Clan's mystic realm was stolen. It is undefended."

His gaze was frank as he spoke.

"Daoist friend Yang, my life is short, while you have only just attained the Dao. With four hundred years ahead of you, your mastery of arrays will only grow more profound. Sooner or later, you would have discovered it. Our two families hold a grudge. Since you could sneak in undetected, would you not wish to see my family's mystic realm? Would you not want to make use of the many treasure lands left by the Great Liang that nurture spiritual resources?"

"Since the end of the Liang, this is the first time my Yu Clan has faced a severance in our line of divine abilities. If the day comes when I fall, even if you didn't dare to seize it openly, by relying on the state of Chen to grant you a glimpse of the mystic realm's gateway, the accumulated wealth of generations would all become yours..."

Yang Xuancai was silent for a moment, then said in a low voice,

"Old Daoist Master, to harbor killing intent so readily, was that not too reckless!"

The old man glanced around, his tone faint.

"My Yu Clan stole this mystic realm ourselves. We couldn't control its seal, so we had no choice but to slaughter every last descendant of the original owners, leaving not even a chicken or dog alive. Consequently, we lived in terror every night, fearing that others would come to steal it from us and annihilate our entire clan in turn."

The old man's features were actually quite kindly; he must have been a pillar of support for his clan. Yet his tone was ice-cold, and his slightly closed eyes held a perfect calm.

"It would have been better to eliminate you first, use the momentum to seize sole control of Ruzhou, and Forbidden Water City would have naturally fallen into my hands."

Now that the grand array was shattered and the mystic realm had fallen, Yu Xi's killing intent from that time was but a dissipating cloud of smoke. He spoke of it now without a care, appearing utterly nonchalant. This sent a chill through Yang Xuancai, who stood beside him. She opened her mouth, but for a moment, was unable to speak a word.

Xuanwei was silent in contemplation, a flicker of understanding in his eyes. Li Que'wan, however, looked somewhat conflicted. She paused for several breaths before Yu Xi finally smiled and said,

"Every word this old man has spoken is true. King Wei need not worry that I am incapable of defending Ruzhou!"

Clearly, Yu Xi was holding nothing back, and his candid explanation had its reasons. He could no longer tolerate his family's legacy being in Yang Xuancai's hands, and he understood that if he didn't reveal the entire truth, Li Zhouwei's misgivings would surely prevent him from being allowed to return to Ruzhou!

The young man before him swept his gaze over him and smiled.

"In that case, Daoist Master Yu... do you have any arrangements for the Yu Clan?"

Yu Xi did not hesitate. He lowered his gaze and bowed.

"The Yu Clan is willing to populate Huainan and till the lands of Sanjiang."

To put it bluntly, with the grand array now shattered and the mystic realm fallen, a century of anxiety had vanished like smoke. Yu Xi truly felt as though a lifetime had passed, yet he also felt a faint sense of being unburdened.

The reason was simple: the Yu Clan's background was not prominent. Years ago, a disciple had gone to cultivate on the mountain but had achieved no great fame. It was only because his disciple-brothers were powerful that he had gained some standing through association.

His previous words had also come from the heart. For all these years, the Yu Clan had clung to this mystic realm like a gold-inlaid porcelain vase—fearful and anxious, yet unwilling to let go, tormented into sleepless nights. Now it was shattered. Thinking of how the even more precious golden bowls of their neighbors had also been broken, he felt he had lost nothing. Instead, he felt an unexpected lightness in his step.

Hearing his words, Li Zhouwei also nodded secretly and smiled.

"Luoxia requires a Daoist Master to return to the court and have an audience with the Emperor. Daoist friend Tao, what do you think of Daoist Master Yu?"

Xuanwei smiled faintly.

"Excellent."

Although the Tao Clan had submitted to the Song, they were very clear about the boundaries of their own direct lineage. They were unwilling for one of their own to represent Luoxia and thus yielded the position. Li Zhouwei then said calmly, 

"I shall write a letter for the Daoist Master to take to the Song court."

What the Yu Clan lacked most was obvious to everyone present. If Yu Xi had previously been hesitant to move due to considerations for the mystic realm, he had no such reservations now.

He gave a deep bow and said, "I invite Your Majesty to follow this old man into the mystic realm, and allow the Yu Clan to present a gift to the King of Wei!"

Xuanwei glanced over. Li Zhouwei nodded. The Daoist Master of the Tao Clan then stepped aside, allowing the two to enter the mystic realm. Li Que'wan seemed lost in thought, but then she saw Yang Xuancai's face turn slightly pale. Yang Xuancai glanced at Xuanwei before quickly turning to Li Que'wan.

"Please wait a moment, honored fairy. King Wei saved my life; the Yang Clan cannot fail to repay this debt!"

She didn't give Li Que'wan a chance to say more, transforming into a gust of spring wind and dispersing. Li Que'wan could only shake her head, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

‘The Yu Clan, the Yang Clan... they were all prepared for this long ago! When serving under someone's banner, they feel uneasy if they aren't made to bleed a little, like the Jia and Wei families were!’

The others waited outside while Yu Xi led Li Zhouwei through the restriction. They descended abruptly, landing before the grand hall woven from Profound Yellow Qi. The old Daoist Master said somberly,

"Hall of Assisting Providence cannot compare to the other clans. It was originally a mystic realm used by the Great Liang to suppress Luoxia, later seized by my Yu Clan. We restored the Valley Water, but the central grand array is linked to several treasure lands that nurture spiritual resources. We couldn't easily alter it, so we left it as it was... Within the mystic realm, Bright Yang is scarce and Li Fire is rare. Whole Pill is nowhere to be seen. A careful count reveals but one portion of Bright Yang, two of Li Fire, and three types of spiritual resources."

"But there is one item that King Wei will surely need!"

He pushed open the doors and entered the grand hall. Inside, the twin auras of the Profound and Yellow swirled up and down in a mesmerizing display. At times, a heavenly water would drizzle down; at others, an immortal qi would cut across the space. It was an extraordinary sight!

And trapped between the twin auras was an object, constantly moving as if alive. It was pure, brilliant white and emanated a gentle radiance. Li Zhouwei's expression tightened, and a strange light flashed in his eyes.

"The Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness?!"

Yu Xi bowed deeply.

"Precisely."

‘No wonder he made such a bold promise!’

The Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness was the most legendary spiritual water of the Purple Mansion Realm among common cultivators. It was said to revive the dead and flesh out bones, to elevate one's aptitude and cleanse their immortal foundation. Every major family sought it as a treasure to stabilize their destiny, making it exceedingly rare in the mortal world!

Li Zhouwei naturally could not help but be moved. His golden eyes, however, swept across the area once more before he spoke calmly,

"Since your esteemed clan cultivates Valley Water, you could part with anything else, but surely not a treasure like this... Why bring it out as an offering to this king?"

These words seemed to lay bare Yu Xi's innermost thoughts. His expression grew extremely dejected.

"The most valuable assets in all of Hall of Assisting Providence are not its items, but the treasure lands left behind by the Great Liang, which nurture spiritual resources. For many years, my family has relied on these to support our Purple Mansion Realm cultivation. One could say we were adept at managing our household..."

"But as the saying goes: one person seeking the Dao can exhaust the wealth of six generations. When my clan's ancestor sought the Dao, he completely exhausted our savings from all those years. Our vitality was grievously wounded, and we were in desperate need of recovery. That is why I was so concerned when Hall of Assisting Providence was attacked—I feared that band of monks would not only steal our treasures but also destroy our family's treasured lands!"

"I could not speak freely outside just now, but I do not fear King Wei's ridicule now—the Yu Clan has a fair amount of spiritual resources, but treasures on the level of Spiritual Treasures or true spiritual items are few and far between. What you see is all we have!"

He said in a low voice, "I can only offer our ancestral heirloom to King Wei!"

Yu Xi presented it with both hands. A point of white light shone from his palm, transforming into a finger-sized white vial surrounded by vivid, colorful clouds of qi.

He said solemnly, "This old one also has a spiritual item of Pure Qi, a Scattering Cloud Treasured Qi..."

Yu Xi's posture was already extremely humble, which rendered Li Zhouwei speechless for a moment. His Spirit Probe was operating with great clarity; the entire expanse of the mystic realm's ruins truly held nothing else of note. Apart from a single portion of Valley Water spiritual water hidden beneath a side hall, all that remained were some miscellaneous spiritual resources...

‘It is, after all, meant to be passed down. Hiding this one portion isn't excessive, nor does it count as deceit...’

Yu Xi hadn't had a chance to return to the mystic realm since he'd left, so he couldn't have had many spiritual items on his person. Once he handed these over, apart from some Purple Mansion Realm spiritual items from the Profound Foundation established by the Great Liang that could be salvaged from the ruins, plus what the monks had stolen days ago, the remainder could be counted on one's fingers! 

Although a starved camel is still bigger than a horse, and the Yu Clan's various spiritual resources could still make them a formidable power in their own right, they were destitute compared to the other clans. They couldn't even compare to the Qiao Clan, who lacked a Purple Mansion Realm...

‘Yet among the offerings, both the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness and the Scattering Cloud Treasured Qi are valuable and useful to the vast majority of Daoist traditions...’

The Yu Clan, after all, had no successors. It could be said that Yu Xi had dug up his very roots to pledge his allegiance. Li Zhouwei saw this clearly. He flipped his hand, took out a portion of White Partridge Origin Spring, and accepted the precious Valley Water. Then he put away the Pure Qi and said softly, "Daoist Master Yu defended Boye and offered the Hall of Assisting Providence. This king has seen it all and will not allow the Yu Clan to suffer a loss."

He glanced around, and as he stepped out into the void, he smiled.

"A place like this is not necessarily impossible to have again."

Yu Xi was stunned at first, a look of shock flashing across his face. Then, suddenly, he found it incredible, a mix of joy and worry filling him. He chased after him, and was just about to speak when a great rumbling echoed through the Great Void. An expanse of ink-black color surged forth, and a nether chariot came driving through the air!

The old man immediately and tactfully fell silent. Li Que'wan's eyes lit up.

‘Someone from the Yang family is here!’

In an instant, the sky turned gloomy, and the flow of spiritual energy was cut off. Yu Xi and the others were clearly seeing Exiled Qi for the first time. Their expressions changed slightly as they watched the pitch-black wheel tracks glide across the sky. The green curtain of the chariot swayed, and a laugh rang out,

"King Wei is valiant and martial! Though Ruiyi was far away in Qilu, I heard of your great name three times a day!"

The man's appearance was unremarkable, yet he commanded the Exiled Qi and held a talisman, with four divine abilities augmenting his body. He was incredibly imposing. It was Yang Ruiyi!

He had crossed into the Purple Mystery and was testing his newfound divine abilities. His spirits were high, and he bore not the slightest injury. Clearly, the battle in the east had yielded favorable results. The cultivators of Northern Zhao had mostly focused on containment, with no real intention of a decisive battle, so they had been utterly suppressed.

With Luoxia pacified, the only remaining worry had been that Yang Ruiyi would be unable to stabilize the eastern front, leaving the Li family trapped without reinforcements. At this moment, Li Zhouwei finally let go of that last sliver of anxiety and smiled.

"So, the Great General has arrived!"
