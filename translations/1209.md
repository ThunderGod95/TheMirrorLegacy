# Chapter 1209: Path of Betrayal

‘Thank heavens…’

‘Thank heavens... I have read the entire Daoist canon of Dongting over the last millennium, so there was no need to search for anything. With no one to deduce matters with me, I returned from the heavens without causing the slightest stir…’

‘Had I made even the slightest move... who knows what trouble might have followed!’

This old cultivator, who had weathered the storms of ancient times, sat frozen in his place, his state of mind undergoing a drastic transformation. Had this been the Tang Xie who had just achieved the Divine Core, he might have agonized over his bonds with the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition. But even though he paid no heed to worldly affairs, after the Upheaval of Sheji, he had long since seen through the so-called friendships of this world!

‘This is no longer the ancient era. In the struggle for the Great Dao, there are no fellow disciples, no masters and apprentices... so long as your interests in the Golden Position align, you are allies... If... if Dongmu Heaven were to learn of this, I, Tang Xie, would be no more than an ant!’

Tang Xie was well-acquainted with the methods of immortals, and for that very reason, he did not hesitate in the slightest. A single thought dominated his mind:

‘Since ancient times, only the pieces openly played upon the board have a chance to contend. Hidden pieces behind the scenes have no recourse and no way forward; held firmly in another's grasp, how could they dare harbor any dissent?’
As a cultivator of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition, he could scoff at ninety percent of the world's cultivators for their shallow backgrounds, but when it came to the game played at the level of True Monarchs and Immortals, the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition, lacking a Golden Core, was ultimately nothing at all!

‘So that's why this Yuanshang came to see me…’

Although Tang Xie had lived in seclusion for many years, as a former Divine Core cultivator—a figure who had, during the great upheaval of the past, decisively abandoned all his mystic realms and Daoist traditions, severing all ties and hiding his presence—he lacked neither courage, shrewdness, nor superior foresight. Back when immortals still walked the land, he presided over Myriad-Prosperity Heaven, and cultivators of the Three Profoundities who entered had to show the Numinous Treasure tradition respect by greeting him as the Attendant Deity of Myriad-Prosperity!

Even with his current fall from grace, and that title long gone, upon hearing this single sentence, he almost instantly made an incredibly accurate and precise strategic judgment:

‘Since Numinous Treasure has entered the domain of sun and moon, the slaughter between heaven and earth will once again be merciless.’

His lapse into thought made Yuanshang hesitate. The immortal official straightened his sleeves, and after waiting a long while without a reply, he finally spoke:

“Senior…”

The two words startled Tang Xie from his reverie. His gaze had already returned to its usual calm as he raised an eyebrow and said:

“For the Chunyi Dao Gate to have you... is a true glory to your ancestors.”

A hint of gratitude appeared in Yuanshang's eyes as he sighed and said:

“We cannot compare to the Numinous Treasure tradition. True Monarch Xu Xiang... is a venerable figure even within the Comprehending Profoundity tradition. I have long heard of the fame of the Five Immortals Below the Profound.”

This was praise from a Woven Jade Immortal, something that should have pleased Tang Xie, but the mention of "Comprehending Profoundity" made his heart skip a beat.

The Comprehending Profoundity Dao was quite prosperous. Although it was initially slightly inferior to the Encompassing Profoundity tradition, its strength lay in its steady accumulation of power. The "Five Immortals Below the Profound" were five immortals enshrined in the side palace when Tongxuan Palace still stood. Because they were not direct disciples of the Comprehending Profoundity Master, their seniority at the time was not high, so they were placed in a subordinate position... they were Shao Da, Xu Xiang, Tian Chen, Tian Wei, and Shen Qiang.

Others might not know, but Tang Xie knew very well; he had even been to that hall. To put it bluntly, his own Daoist statue was right there at the feet of Xu Xiang's effigy... there was some embellishment to these Five Immortals.

‘Back then... that troublemaker Wuguan went straight to the Encompassing Profoundity tradition the moment he attained the Dao and specifically established the Three Monarchs and Five Immortals, yet he never mentioned Comprehending Profoundity at all.’

‘At the time, Azure Profoundity had Dongjun of the Supreme Yang Palace and few disciples, so they didn't need to contend for such empty fame. The Comprehending and Encompassing Profoundity traditions, however, were competing for supremacy. Shangguan Zidu couldn't stand it and insisted on establishing a hall to pull out five immortals of his own... In truth, when the side palace was established, only Shao Da and Xu Xiang were confirmed Dao Embryos; the other three were unclear...’

In other words, the establishment of these Five Immortals was partly a matter of pride. Xuanda Heaven and Myriad-Prosperity Heaven were well-deserved and mentioned more often, while the other three Daoist traditions were later forgotten. For Yuanshang to suddenly ask about them filled Tang Xie with doubt. He sighed.

“I never thought the Chunyi Dao Gate would also recognize the names of the Five Immortals of Tongxuan Palace...”

Yuanshang had assumed this matter was no great secret and was surprised by the question. He could only answer truthfully:

“Back when I had just reached the Purple Mansion Realm, I met a young man named Qi Wu’an. He had a grand air about him, claiming to be an heir of the Numinous Treasure tradition, and he fooled all the Purple Mansion cultivators. It was only later, when Mount Jingyi confronted him and exposed the lie, that we bystanders learned of these secrets…”

Hearing the name Mount Jingyi, Tang Xie sighed softly and nodded to show he understood. But Yuanshang had not forgotten the question Zhengao had posed to him long ago. Having held it in for some time, he asked softly:

“Senior, since you are an ancient cultivator... do you recognize the Wall-Below Daoist tradition?”

“How could I not?”

Tang Xie wore a courteous expression, but his mind grew vigilant. He smiled as he replied, and a look of joy crossed Yuanshang’s face.

“I wonder about its origins, and what Daoist traditions it has today? I've also heard it's related to the Supreme Yin, and the Supreme Yin resides in Azure Profoundity…”

As soon as he said this, Tang Xie was filled with astonishment and frowned inwardly:

‘Why is he asking me? For a matter concerning an ancient immortal abode, what need is there to ask me?’

His suspicion deepened, but he decided to probe, his tone gentle and unhurried:

“That is not difficult. I will teach you a mnemonic: 'The path of Comprehending Profoundity is supreme self-veneration; the gods of Encompassing Profoundity bow to imperial decree. They hide within the rising sun to plot the one true path, while the unified Primordial Dao refines Azure Profoundity.'”

After speaking, Tang Xie immediately observed the other's expression, noticing that Yuanshang merely nodded quietly, showing no reaction.

‘I recited their Azure Profoundity mnemonic, and he's never even heard it!’

His doubt intensified, but he still straightened his robes and bowed to show his respect for this figure before continuing:

“The Daoist traditions of ancient cultivators were not like today, where one cultivates whatever the Golden Position dictates. True Monarch Yuanxia achieved his Fruition Attainment in the 'Supreme Yin.' He had numerous Woven Jade Immortals and the authority to command gods, which makes him an Encompassing Profoundity cultivator. The Fruition Attainments of Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang are often found within Azure Profoundity. Since he belonged to the Encompassing Profoundity tradition, one can guess he must have held an Auxiliary or Intercalary Position.”

“True Monarch Yuanxia's secular surname was Han, and his proper titles were 'Supreme Yin Profound Monarch, Lord of Faint Moon's Radiance' and 'True Monarch of the Supreme Yin of the Yuan Court.' He was originally the prince of Gaoping Prefecture. He began seeking the Dao at thirty-nine, achieved the Great Dao at one hundred nineteen, and established the Taiyuan Court. It is said he perished while seeking Dao Embryo.”

“The Taiyuan Court had thirteen Woven Jade Immortals and later split into six branches, which gradually faded away. The descendant Daoist traditions are either hidden or broken, but one bloodline has survived. Regardless of its rise or fall, later generations of cultivators have never dared to encroach upon it.”

A thoughtful expression slowly grew on Yuanshang's face. He finally made a decision, taking a jade talisman from his sleeve and placing it in the other's hand. He spoke softly:

“Then has this Wall-Below Woven Jade technique been disseminated? Could Senior perhaps take a look for me and see which lineage this Daoist tradition resembles.”

Tang Xie took it and read carefully. After a slight pause, a look of shock appeared in his eyes.

“This... the Way of the Supreme Yin Woven Jade was possessed by all Three Profoundities in the early days. They were Azure Profoundity's 'Profound Bearer,' Encompassing Profoundity's 'Wall-Below,' and Comprehending Profoundity's 'Shuo Lou' and 'Guanhua.' There is a saying: 'Dan and Han hasten to the hall to hear of Wu Earth,' which speaks of the excellent occasion when disciples from the first two houses went to study at Comprehending Profoundity.”

“In later generations, Azure Profoundity went into seclusion and Comprehending Profoundity gained many disciples, so the latter three houses became dominant. This Dao is undoubtedly that of 'Wall-Below,' but... from the style, the phrasing is domineering and all-encompassing. It resembles…”

He lowered his voice.

“The Daoist tradition of Immortal Lord Qingyi. Looking at the cited examples and calculating the era, it was most likely... passed down by True Monarch Chongyuan.”

Yuanshang's heart sank in an instant. He had hoped to hear that this art was widespread among the Three Profoundities, but now he heard a completely unfamiliar name. He raised his brow and whispered:

“And he is…”

Tang Xie said:

“You would not know his name. When he attained the Dao, flowers bloomed under the moon. His position was in the 'Lesser Yin,' and he possessed a grotto-heaven called Wanling Heaven.”

In a flash, clarity dawned in Yuanshang’s mind.

‘Ning State... it really is Ning State... no wonder...’

‘My Xi family was also one of the Immortal Clans that co-founded Great Ning. The Xi clan has also been to Wanling Heaven... This Woven Jade technique wasn't even passed down by the Immortal Mansion. It truly is a clan inheritance...’

The founder of the Chunyi Dao Gate had cultivated in the grotto-heaven, later went to serve in the Immortal Mansion, and finally established the Chunyi Dao Gate. The various spell arts and Supreme Yin divine abilities in the Daoist tradition were, in fact, mostly from the Immortal Mansion's lineage.

If one were to trace its source, it would be none other than a remnant branch of the Immortal Mansion. Yet, in the founder's life story, his departure from the grotto-heaven was described as: "Bestowed with a scroll, dispatched to the Immortal Mansion."

This led later cultivators to endless speculation, with constant disputes over the meaning of "a scroll." After all, Lord Yingze also held a Supreme Yin Auxiliary Position. If what the Supreme Yang bestowed was the core "Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic" for seeking to become a Woven Jade Immortal, then Jiequn might also have been taught the Daoist tradition, merely going to the Immortal Mansion to supplement his divine abilities and secret arts.

Unfortunately, this scroll was a well-guarded secret and could not be brought out for clarification. Cultivators of the Chunyi Dao Gate could only bury their doubts in their hearts. Furthermore, while Jiequn was alive, he always identified as a Supreme Yang cultivator. The Immortal Mansion had also issued an order that no region was to use the name of the Supreme Yin. The Chunyi Dao Gate, located in the Eastern Sea, was not even under the Immortal Mansion's jurisdiction and dared not claim to be part of it... For all these reasons, Chunyi had no choice but to revere the Supreme Yang...

It was because of this that when Zhengao asked, his answer could only waver between Supreme Yang and the Immortal Mansion. Now, knowing the truth, he sat silently, accepting a result that overturned the very foundation of the Chunyi Dao Gate, his mind in a daze.

‘If we are from the Immortal Mansion, why call ourselves Supreme Yang…’

He remained silent for a long time, his gaze shifting to the hazy gray clouds in the sky. Beside him, Tang Xie was unaware of the turmoil in his heart but was equally lost in heavy thoughts:

‘Since Yuanshang claims to be from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... that tradition... has several True Monarchs still living! And I've heard that these True Monarchs... seem to have gone their separate ways, perhaps even to the point of harming their own brethren...’

What were the stances of these True Monarchs? Which side did they stand on in the grand scheme of the world? And then there was the Immortal Mansion...

His thoughts raced, quickly connecting these points to various corresponding events in the present world. Unfortunately, he knew little, only scraps from his disciples' conversations. A deep unease grew in his heart, but Yuanshang suddenly spoke in a low voice:

“The Immortal Mansion and the Donghua Dao-path, how much do you know, friend? Or rather... do you know the truth behind the Immortal Mansion's seclusion back then?”

Tang Xie had not expected their thoughts to align so perfectly. He narrowed his eyes slightly, his earlier suspicions rushing back as he sensed something was amiss with the man. He shook his head.

“I have heard a thing or two about the Immortal Mansion, but I don't know much. However, I am curious... since you are of an Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition, you must know of these things. It should be I asking you, so why are you asking me?”

Yuanshang was at a loss for words, but Zhengao had, after all, instructed him to clarify his lineage, and who knew when his next trip to the heavens would be. He finally shook his head and said bitterly:

“Senior, you may not know... this Woven Jade technique is the very method of my own Dao attainment. Because its lineage is unclear, I was not accepted by the Upper Realm and was thus sent down to stand guard here. Although the Immortal General mentioned that anyone positioned here must be from a direct lineage of a great personage... still... I have been plagued by doubts for a long time. Having finally met you, Senior, how could I not ask for some clues!”

Tang Xie listened, a mix of understanding and shock dawning on him. As he pondered the words, a sense of dread washed over him:

‘So that's it... an unclear lineage?’

He had cultivated for thousands of years. Yuanshang was clearly from the Gonghua Heaven Daoist tradition; how could he be rejected because of a Woven Jade technique? When one of your own people climbs the ladder to a position, do you question whose ladder it was? If a True Monarch attained the Dao using another lineage's Quest for Gold method, does that make him one of them?

Impossible!

‘What other reason could there be? It must be that there is a problem with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition behind him!’

‘The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is a branch from the heavens, that much is true... Even the Immortal Mansion and Yingze are likely people from the heavens. But it is precisely because the heavens are in seclusion that trouble has brewed below in the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. A portion of the True Monarchs have already betrayed them, and the intentions of others are unclear, colluding with other powers... The heavens cannot expose themselves for the time being, and that is what leads to him 'not being accepted'!’

Dark clouds gathered in Tang Xie's mind, and a flash of insight struck him:

‘Something must have happened in the mortal world... either these True Monarchs carved up the inheritance and killed people from the Immortal Mansion, or the ones who fell were the loyal followers of the heavens. In any case, the heavens have long since sensed that something is wrong...’

‘A pity... a pity. If I could look into the history of the present world, I might be able to find these great changes. But it is no longer appropriate for me to investigate anything at all...’

If Tang Xie could uncover the various changes within the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and obtain the schemes or records of the Golden Core level, he would surely grasp seventy or eighty percent of the truth. But the tracks of Golden Core cultivators are often erased, and he, Tang Xie, would never be so foolish as to ask his Comprehending Profoundity Daoist friends about these secrets!

‘Wait... there's still the man before me!’

His thoughts shifted rapidly. He raised his brow slightly, his gaze burning as he looked at Yuanshang and said in a grave voice:

“Let me first ask you something, friend—afterward... did the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition have any conflict with the Immortal Mansion?”

At these words, Yuanshang's expression changed abruptly. His mind felt as if it had been split open by a terrifying bolt of lightning, the chaos dissipating as understanding dawned:

‘That's right... that's right... The matter with Daoist Master Guanyu could be explained as a grand scheme, but the Chunyi Dao Gate... in the Donghua affair, did we truly do our best?!’

The young man's face instantly paled. After a long moment, he lowered his head and said:

“There was... there was such a matter... People were killed, treasures were stolen... everyone was involved... Those who didn't participate stood idly by... I... sigh...”

‘Just as I thought!’

The colors in Tang Xie's eyes grew complex, and a chill crept into his heart.

‘He doesn't just represent the fierce Dao struggle between the heavens and the outside world; he probably also represents the heavens' own hesitation... Who betrayed, who feigned compliance, who stood aloof... Naturally, they couldn't tell me, and it would be even harder to tell him. The heavens no longer trust the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and that is why he is here.’

Since ancient times, betrayal between master and disciple has been an extremely sensitive topic. This was not a matter of siding with a faction or a Daoist tradition choosing a side in a struggle for profit; it was a problem within the Dao-path itself.

The masters of the Three Profoundities' direct lineages painstakingly use the resources of their tradition to help you attain the Dao, only for you to watch coldly as your martial brother falls. What would the martial uncles and nephews think?

The Upheaval of Sheji caused the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition's fall from grace.

What did the Encompassing Profoundity tradition call it? They called it the 'Sheji Apostasy.' (Shèjì pàndào) The word for apostasy, 'pan,' was a pun, also alluding to the Earth Virtue they were founded on—a scathing, veiled accusation that Sheji had been utterly ungrateful!

Even Tang Xie, an outsider forced to watch helplessly, had carried this shame to this day, fearing that if he were to cultivate the Purple and Gold Dao again, he would be mocked. How could he not understand this feeling?

‘They are using me to remind him, and using him to make me judge my own stance...’

At that moment, looking at the young man before him, Tang Xie seemed to see his younger self, pale-faced and hiding in a grotto-heaven. He was silent for a long time, watching the enlightened Yuanshang, and said in a low, haunting voice:

“Then your Chunyi Dao Gate... what part did it play in all this?”
