# Chapter 1189: Refining a Treasure

A handsome steed, adorned with a crimson flower, swayed with a gentle, rhythmic gait. The bridegroom was clad in red robes, his head held high and his chest out. His black hair stirred in the wind, making his golden eyes seem all the brighter.

As the direct heir of the Bright Yang lineage and the island's singular rising star, Li Suihuan was the public face of the Li Clan, a man who bore immense responsibility. In the past, Li Jiangzong had tried to train his successor by gradually assigning him clan duties, only to discover that the young heir was like a bottomless pit. No matter how many tasks were sent his way, they would be returned to the hall the very next day, flawlessly handled.

Li Jiangzong knew then,

'My own aptitude is dull; I can no longer keep up.'

From the day he first entered the Crimson Radiance Hall to share the burdens of the clan, to this day, when he rode toward Fullness Pavilion, Li Suihuan's competence was absolute. In the hall, he could manage the affairs of a thousand households; outside, he could command the respect of all the immortal ministers. Everything was done to perfection, earning the approval of all, without the slightest delay.

Every Family Head in history had their own particular traits. The current head, Li Jiangzong, was often partial in his management, showing favor to his own kin. Even Li Jiangqian, in Li Xuanxuan's estimation, had a knack for schemes but possessed an authority that couldn't quell the truly defiant. Yet, under the scrutiny of countless critical eyes, this direct heir of the Bright Yang lineage effortlessly maintained his impartiality and fairness, placating the people and securing their trust. Governing an Immortal Clan of this scale was far from his limit; it was, in fact, a mere diversion from his cultivation.

Over the years, his prestige had come to surpass even Li Jiangzong's. To put it bluntly, he was the perfect heir according to clan law, the most beloved clansman of the Bright Yang lineage, and a Clan Justicar who overlooked nothing. The rise of Li Suihuan had greatly eased the anxieties of the elder Li Xuanxuan, who had even thought to himself,

'Though our family has many capable people, when my time comes a century from now, he is the only one who can unite the four branches of the family with bonds of kinship!'

Therefore, when he saw the tall steed with the crimson flower step into the pavilion, a smile spread across Li Xuanxuan's face. He took the Daoist Master's hand and sighed.

"This is the heir of our main line, the finest young man in our family!"

A smile touched Li Ximing's lips as well. He glanced over and noticed a familiar figure at Li Suihuan's side, leading the horse. It was a middle-aged man with a cold, stern face—none other than Li Wushao, who had been summoned back to the island a year ago.

The black robes he had worn for years had been forcibly replaced with red ones, and a large crimson flower was even pinned to his chest. The old demon looked utterly out of place, especially having to walk before the eyes of the crowd. He was forcing a smile that was frozen on his face, his eyes vacant and dull.

Looking at that familiar face, Li Xuanxuan chuckled to himself.

'Hah…'

Ever since attaining his divine abilities, Li Ximing rarely involved himself in the family's internal affairs, but he still heard reports about the clan heir, Li Suihuan. He watched intently as the noble groom led his bride into the hall, passing through the crowds until they arrived before him to pay their respects.

"Greetings, Daoist Master, Old Ancestor!"

Li Ximing observed him and thought,

'Impressive… his cultivation is very stable. He hasn't wasted these past years. He's already at the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. The only thing left is whether he takes a Talisman Pill or not…'

He nodded with a smile.

"Today is an auspicious day. I have also prepared some pills and ceremonial artifacts as a gift to you both."

He presented two jade boxes he had prepared, then took the two pairs of golden rings that Li Jiangzong had rushed to forge. The mandarin duck patterns on them shone brightly. Li Ximing imbued them with the Light of the Six Harmonies and infused them with the aura of the Bright Yang. He smiled and said,

"I will leave a wisp of my divine ability's dharma power within, enhanced by the World's Radiance. Keep them in their box on normal days and do not open it. At a critical moment, they will unleash considerable power!"

The couple bowed in acceptance. Li Ximing smiled and turned, gesturing toward the old man.

"First, pay your respects to the old lord. Afterward, I must take him to consume a spiritual medicine to treat his ailment."

Li Jianglong was not present, so an elder naturally took his place. The pair dared not delay and performed the grand rites. Li Ximing allowed the rest of the ceremony to proceed as planned while he helped the old man to his feet and stepped into the Great Void. Li Xuanxuan still seemed apprehensive.

"I'm just a bag of old bones," he said. "I'm afraid there's no need to trouble the Daoist Master's divine abilities like this!"

Li Ximing shook his head without a word. The wedding banquet had stirred many feelings within him.

He sighed, "Zhouming is without ambition, Zhouluo lacks talent, and Minggong suffered great hardship in her youth, leaving her foundation weak. Zhouda is a pillar, but he rose from obscurity and his path forward has reached its end. Queyi and Xinghan have exhausted their resources, yet they lack the spark of insight needed to attain the Dao. The other branches are filled with mediocrity. All those with true talent and intellect belong to the next generation… But what I detest most… is that our Chenghui died so young."

Li Xuanxuan's expression trembled. He lowered his eyes, silent. Li Ximing's face was a mask of pain and bitterness.

"In the past, we lacked spiritual items and treasured pills. Now, we lack for nothing, and only now do I understand why the great immortal sects of old had so few cultivators reach the Purple Mansion Realm. Thinking back, aside from the few Daoist Masters in our family, for generations, starting from my own, he was the only one who had the heart and mind to reach the Purple Mansion Realm on his own! Chenghui! He was the pillar of purple and gold left behind by Aunt Qinghong. In my youth, my divine abilities were insufficient. I was too rash and not cautious enough, and it was my fault he perished!"

"The heartache began all those years ago. Now, the more I look at these juniors, the more it feels like a rat is gnawing at my heart. If he had not fallen, today should have been the day he emerged from seclusion, a master of the Purple Mansion Realm… Why would I have needed to seek out the Hengzhu arts? I could have simply let Qinggong follow him and cultivate the Dao of lightning!"

Li Chenghui was a descendant of the Xi generation and a bridge to the Zhou generation. Despite never receiving a talisman, he had carved a path through countless bloody battles. He had stood guard by the river for ten long years, striking fear into the three caves. He outshone the four members of the Xi generation and could have suppressed the entire Zhou generation. Had it not been for Li Zhouwei, there would likely be few even today who could compare to him. How could Li Xuanxuan not feel the same pain?

The old man sighed. Li Ximing continued, his voice filled with anguish,

"That boy Zhouming said he wanted to descend to meet our ancestors with his treasured scroll in hand. It made me think… if the Underworld truly exists, and I meet our elders… if they ask me about Chenghui, I… this grandson of theirs will be utterly consumed by shame…"

Li Xuanxuan, by contrast, seemed far more at peace.

"At that time, our family had no one in the Purple Mansion Realm. The heavens were weaving a hundred different schemes, none of which we could perceive. You did everything in your power to protect our disciples and bring them this far. You did your best."

Li Ximing found it difficult to speak. In the blink of an eye, they arrived before the formation. He let the conversation die, riding the wind down into a pavilion where two figures stood waiting.

A Daoist sat in the pavilion. He had the refined features of an immortal, yet beneath his skin-bag, a demonic mist roiled. A bloody light bloomed from his very bones, radiating a strange and wicked aura. The other figure was a demon beast, standing respectfully to the side. Although its demonic qi was potent, it was tinged with a faint, clear light. Next to the Daoist, it almost appeared righteous.

Seeing Li Ximing descend, the demon beast was the first to rise. It bowed its head with profound respect.

"This little demon greets the two benefactors!"

This demon was none other than Ying Hebai, the Northern Brocade River King who had once terrorized the Sanjiang region. The man behind him, naturally, was the demonic cultivator fostered by the Dragon-kin, Ping Yan of Yinzhou Island.
Li Ximing had known Xiang Chun wouldn't come to the mainland herself, but he hadn't expected her to send this fiend in her stead. The monstrous demonic qi billowing from the man's head as he sat at the foot of the mountain was nearly enough to scatter the pure qi of the entire peak.

Li Ximing had little desire to see him, but Ping Yan was exceedingly polite. He took a step forward and sighed.

"I have been in seclusion for many years, struggling time and again with the Purple Mystery. On this rare visit to the mainland, I find the world has been turned upside down. Congratulations… congratulations!"

Li Ximing cut straight to the point, forgoing any pleasantries.

"Did the Daoist nun send the spiritual medicine?"

"Indeed!"

Ping Yan seemed slightly awkward. He hastily retrieved a wooden box from his sleeve.

"The Daoist nun heard that your noble clan dislikes being tainted by the stench of blood, which gave her quite a headache. After asking around, she finally obtained a method from the Innocent Guilt Gate in the south called the 'Marvelous Formula of the Homeland.' She dispatched her people, and the medicine was only just refined this month. I came at once!"

'Such influence!'

Li Ximing had assumed they had simply taken a treasure from the Dragon-kin's vaults. He never imagined the Daoist nun wielded such power—first trading for a formula from another Daoist Tradition, then sending her own people to refine it, forcibly bringing the item into existence.

The demonic cultivator opened the wooden box. The inside was lined with fine Cinnabar powder. A shallow, fist-sized pit had been dug in the center, and nestled within was a round, white spiritual item that resembled a ball of glutinous rice.

Ping Yan sighed.

"The Innocent Guilt Gate may be a heretical path that mixes immortals, demons, and Buddhists, but it has deep roots. It is centered on the Wood Virtue and possesses faint traces of the long-lost arts of Protecting Wood. That Daoist Tradition has conducted extensive research into extending one's life…"

"This item is not easy to refine. First, one must find a type of Spirit Beast called a 'Ji Worm,' which lives in earth and wood. Then, it must be fed a special spiritual resource of Protecting Wood until it spits silk. Only after three years of this feeding is there enough of the treasured material to refine the formula."

He gave a slight smile, a strange light glinting in his demonic eyes.

"This treasure was originally intended for cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm. Although a person can only use it once, as long as it is placed within the Shengyang Acupoint's mansion, it will slowly replenish one's spiritual lifespan and Dharma Body. For a cultivator of the Wood Virtue, it can extend one's life by up to eighteen years. Considering the elemental cycles of your Daoist Tradition, it should grant at least five."

The demonic cultivator paused briefly.

"What's even more marvelous is that it consumes very little energy to be nurtured by a Qi Refining cultivator. I see the old gentleman is of the Pristine Water attribute, so twenty years should be more than enough. When he passes away, the spiritual item can even be retrieved for another to use!"

Li Xuanxuan was greatly pleased to hear this and nodded repeatedly. Li Ximing, however, felt something different. Within his spiritual sense, his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was stirring, pulsing with a distinct sense of hunger.

'It can even nourish my alternate body… To ensure she wouldn't leave empty-handed, Xiang Chun truly thought of everything!'

After all, pills refined from the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness and Immeasurable Water and Fire were exceedingly rare, even for the Dragon-kin. Xiang Chun was already preparing for her own breakthrough to the Purple Mystery; of course she was determined to succeed.

He finally confirmed that the item radiated pure qi. A scan with an Immortal Artifact revealed no tricks or hidden dangers. Only then did he nod in satisfaction. He took out the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill and replied,

"We have troubled the Daoist nun. Please convey my thanks to her!"

Ping Yan smiled and nodded. Seeing that Li Ximing had no intention of being friendly, he carefully inspected the pill before putting it away. He took his leave, saying,

"I hear that Jianghuai has been restored. In the future, I shall follow the great lords to meet King Wei again upon the Ji River. I hope His Majesty achieves his goals soon. Then I, too, can say I have seen a True Monarch with my own eyes!"

It was a fine sentiment. Li Ximing gave a polite nod in return, then helped the old man back up the mountain and had him sit down.

"Grandfather, please relax your mind."

Knowing that this precious item would not be wasted on him put Li Xuanxuan in high spirits; even his complexion improved. Li Ximing activated his Life Divine Ability, and it took a full seventy-one days to refine the round, white formula into the old man's body. Throughout the process, the elder remained in a deep, unbroken sleep.

Li Ximing sensed the vibrant life force teeming within the old man's Shengyang Acupoint mansion and nodded, relieved. He had someone escort him away, then let out a long, slow breath. Just then, a Courtyard Guard arrived to report,

"Li Wushao requests an audience!"

Li Ximing finally remembered him. A year, he calculated, had passed since he had last given the man any attention.

"Let him come up."

Before long, the old demon had arrived on the mountain. He bowed before Li Ximing and sighed.

"I finally get to see you, Daoist Master! This subordinate has not been back to the island in years, and everything feels unfamiliar. I couldn't even find an opportunity to meet you in private! I asked everyone I could, and finally managed to get the task of leading the horse, but even when I saw you, I couldn't speak…"

He was an old acquaintance. His nature-spirit had been transferred from Li Xizhi to Zhouluo, who had then sent him back. Li Ximing felt a certain unique attachment to him. He chuckled.

"I know you're cursing me under your breath again, but you can't blame them. I was refining a pill; no one was permitted to see me."

"I wouldn't dare…" Li Wushao lowered his eyes and grinned. "I came to the island under orders. There is an item I must deliver to you, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing's expression turned serious. He watched as Li Wushao opened his mouth and spat out an object from within his stomach. It landed on the steps with a flash of light, causing the Daoist Master's face to change color. He shot to his feet.

"A Spiritual Artifact? Who gave it to you!"

Li Wushao bowed low.

"This item is a relic left behind by Kong Tingyun."

Li Ximing's expression shifted again, becoming complex.

Kong Tingyun's relationship with the Li Clan had been a good one, but the ways of the world were unpredictable. Their friend of many years had been swept up by storms beyond her control, leading her down the path she had walked…

Li Wushao explained the full story.

"The young master obtained this item and wished to have it sent to the island, but he couldn't trust anyone with the task. The few Holders of the Profound have all been dispatched to various regions, and their return to the capital is brief, only long enough to pay respects before the emperor. It was a coincidence that a message arrived from the clan, so he had me bring it along on my way back."

Li Ximing swept his spiritual sense over the artifact and gained a general understanding of its abilities.

'One is 'Nurturing Earth,' used to imbue barren land with spiritual vitality. It's quite unique and a rare treasure for the overseas Daoist Traditions. Another is 'Wall Stone,' for defense… and the last is 'Resource Healing,' an excellent art for recovery!'

The item had a long history, and its craftsmanship was quite brilliant. Unfortunately, it lacked a certain finesse. Its marvels were too conventional, too mediocre. By today's standards, it could never be considered a Spiritual Treasure.

But before he could examine it more closely, a host of marvels surged from the masterless object. Rays of light turned inward, and several lines of bold script flooded his mind:

'The Dao resides in Spiritual Treasures, a gift of the Profound Court. Should any dare to steal it, the She Immortals will know.'

Li Ximing was truly stunned for a moment before understanding dawned.

'What a 'Comprehending Profoundity' Daoist Tradition!'

The Spiritual Artifact was clearly marked with a warning from the Tongxuan—from what year or month, he couldn't say, but it was still a blatant declaration to the world: even if you acquire this by accident, you had best return it to Tongxuan!

'So it's like a standard-issue Spiritual Artifact for Tongxuan disciples! When Qi Lanyan gave this to Kong Tingyun, he was ensuring it would just rot in her hands!'

Now Li Ximing understood why Zhouluo hadn't used a reliable choice like Jiangliang, and had instead entrusted the delivery to a mere demon beast at the Foundation Establishment Realm. This thing… it truly couldn't be sent through any open channels.

'The Numinous Treasure Daoist Tradition… I heard it belongs to that Wang Ziya. I wonder how powerful they are now, and if any major figures still preside over them…'

Regardless, he certainly couldn't use this item openly. But its materials were of high quality. Even if he just melted it down to extract its various spiritual substances, it was undoubtedly the most valuable part of Kong Tingyun's legacy.

'Kong Tingyun wouldn't have intentionally thrown my family a hot potato. The Numinous Treasure Daoist Tradition has been in seclusion for many years, and any 'She Immortals' have long been buried in the dust of history. The warning on this artifact is most likely useless now. Out of respect for the Tongxuan, I'll melt it down… In truth, even without the warning, its abilities aren't very useful for my family. It was destined to be melted down sooner or later…'

He pondered for a moment, then sneered.

' "The She Immortals will know," indeed. If I use it here on my island, I doubt any She Immortal in existence could detect it. Better yet, I can take it out into the world. I'll have Zhouwei use it for now! When the time comes to build the formation, I'll dismantle you then!'

Though he said this, he didn't act rashly. He wrote a letter and had it sent to the Qusi, inquiring about this 'Vast Earth Treasured Heart Jade.' Then he turned to the old demon.

"You may rest for now. In a few months at the shortest, or a year at the longest, I will have a task for you."

...

While Li Ximing methodically handled clan affairs, Li Que'wan remained in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. After a brief chat with Li Jiangqian, she took the inconspicuous little bottle, descended from the upper floor of the pavilion, and made her way to a small courtyard.

The courtyard was spartan. Two ritual lamps stood on the ground, casting a pure, white moonlight upon a jade table. With a raise of her hand, an azure cauldron flew out, spinning through the air before landing squarely before her.

The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron was a treasure of 'Gathering Wood.' In the hands of anyone else in the Li family, it was unremarkable, but in hers, it was the single most suitable tool short of a true Spiritual Treasure. She cherished it deeply, and had even come to a secret realization:

'This Profound Cauldron's primary purpose in the grotto-heaven is to condense spiritual essence. It was crafted specifically for this function, which must have come at a great cost. Its value exceeds that of ordinary Spiritual Artifacts. For all these years, the two elders have underestimated it!'

For now, she used a divine ability to stabilize the Profound Cauldron. She was in no hurry to open the bottle. Instead, she formed a hand seal and summoned a brilliant pill from between her eyebrows. It had a silver base and was etched with crimson patterns:

The Mystic Tablet Edict Pill!

Beyond its most prominent marvel, the Blessing of Divinity, the pill possessed three others.

The most powerful of these was Profound Balance. It normally required a cultivator of the Hengzhu arts to activate and was a Dao of staving off disaster and questioning spirits.

By circulating the power of this Spiritual Treasure, Li Que'wan could stave off disastrous blows, temporarily negating most of the damage she sustained and delaying its physical manifestation by three to six breaths.

In other words, if Li Que'wan suffered a grievous injury in an instant, she would have at least three breaths of time to react and forcibly cast an art!

Furthermore, she speculated that this marvel was originally meant to enhance a specific divine ability of Hengzhu cultivators. If a cultivator who possessed that divine ability were to use the Mystic Tablet Edict Pill, they could postpone their own death for an hour, or perhaps even longer, even after being struck by a fatal blow.

'The arts of Hengzhu are truly extraordinary! A pity. There was also the ability to question ghosts and gods, which was likely meant to be used with the disaster aversion. But unlike the Edict-God art, it requires sensing the Fruition Attainments of too many spiritual beings, so it is no longer effective.'

Another marvel, known as Hidden Profundity, was no less peculiar or powerful. It was a storage art, allowing her to place a prepared spiritual water or fire within the pill for slow refinement. As long as it didn't conflict with the Hengzhu arts, she could gain a fraction of its power.

If Li Que'wan were to store a portion of the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness inside, it would be almost like consuming a Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill. The key was that it didn't hinder her ability to command the elements, and the substance could be retrieved whenever she needed it.

What Li Que'wan had placed inside was that 'Mansion Water' treasure, the Profound Coffin Crimson Water.

'Although it has not yet fully merged with the Spiritual Treasure, I can already sense it. As long as this Mansion Water remains within the Spiritual Treasure, it's as if I am constantly benefiting from a third of a Mansion Water spiritual pill. Not only does it significantly boost my cultivation and healing speed out of thin air, but it also grants the powerful effect of transforming water and wood!'

This was the terror of the Spiritual Treasure. Its effects were wondrously unpredictable. Either of these two marvels alone would be enough to forge an exceedingly precious Spiritual Artifact.

'What's more… this marvel is called Hidden Profundity… and this Spiritual Treasure is part of a set, the Five Edicts of Hidden Profundity!'

She was an exceptionally sharp woman. Merely speculating on the marvel's name sparked a thrilling conjecture in her mind:

'What if all five of the Edict Pills possess this Hidden Profundity marvel? Wouldn't the Daoist Master from the Purple Emblem Palace who collected the entire set be equivalent to having the blessing of five spiritual pills at all times? As long as those five spiritual items were of high enough quality, he would be like a god incarnate!'

The final marvel was called Material Derivation. It was the most inconspicuous of the four, offering a slight aid to the transformation of material properties. While minor compared to the first three, even this small function was enough to rival Li Ximing's East Life-Mandate Vase.

'That person from the Yang family said this Spiritual Treasure could define an era. He wasn't wrong!'

She had brought out the pill precisely to empower herself with the Material Derivation marvel.

The jade bottle flew high and tilted, pouring its contents down. A cyan-white light, like a wisp of smoke, drifted into the cauldron. The color of quicksilver surged like a tide. The woman sat, focused and serene, unmoving for a long time.

The Cinnabar mark between her brows rippled like water, illuminating series after series of profound, dark inscriptions. They were like nimble luan birds, riding the wind down and drifting into the treasured cauldron.

After an unknown amount of time, a flicker of doubt appeared in her beautiful eyes.

'Still empty! It doesn't even feel like emptiness…'

It was said that in the hands of a 'Whole Pill' cultivator like herself, every spiritual item had a discernible life-mandate, whether high or low. But this substance showed nothing. It even gave her a strange, faint premonition:

'It's almost the reverse… as if the mortal world owes it a portion of its life-mandate. How can such a spiritual item exist in this world?'

Undoubtedly, this state of being owed a life-mandate was held in a fragile balance. Li Que'wan had only been probing at it from the side when the cyan-white qi erupted with terrifying speed. At its very center, like a lotus breaking the water's surface, a multicolored radiance began to bloom.
She acted at once, pushing her divine ability to its limit to suppress the boiling cyan-white qi below. Focusing all her power to guide it, she was surprised to find she could lift the clear light with ease.

The object was white on the inside and ringed with color on the outside, appearing as if wreathed in mist, and was shaped like a lotus flower. Under her gaze, it came to life, bursting into full bloom within the cauldron. An intoxicating fragrance threatened to overwhelm her but was contained by her surging divine ability. Her heart trembled.

"A spiritual item… it's a 'Pure Qi' spiritual item!"

There was an unwritten rule in the transformation of materials: ninety percent of spiritual items with an equal life-mandate were supported by Pure Qi. This item appeared to have a void life-mandate, but was that not also a form of equality? She had suspected it might contain Pure Qi, but she never imagined a spiritual item would emerge first.

'A Pure Qi spiritual item… The rarity of high-grade Pure Qi ranks among the very highest of all spiritual items in the world!'
