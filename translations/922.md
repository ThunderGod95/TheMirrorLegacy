# Chapter 922: Qingyu Qian

Mount Dali.

Leaves drifted across a thousand peaks, carried on the mournful autumn wind. The treacherous mountains of Mount Dali rose high, its sixteen Demon Caves overflowing with a dazzling, radiant Spiritual Qi. Several Demon beasts patrolled the skies, riding the wind. All were clad in armor, their movements precise and orderly.

The golden-eyed man paused on the mountainside, his gaze piercing. The White Ape Demon beast behind him stepped forward at once, frowning slightly. Below them, a throng of demons dropped to the ground, kowtowing and crying out "Great King!" One Demon beast broke from the crowd and crawled forward, prostrating itself. It knocked its head on the ground before the man's boots and called out:

"We were unaware of which sacred territory Your Lordship hails from. We have already dispatched a messenger to summon the Demon King from the cave. Please, milord, grant us your name so that we may announce you properly!"

Li Zhouwei glanced at the surrounding Demon beasts. "A neighbor from the lake," he replied.

Before his voice faded, two streaks of light shot toward them, transforming mid-air into two middle-aged men. Li Zhouwei focused his gaze and recognized them: one was a deer spirit, the other a bear. Both possessed the cultivation of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

The two Demon beasts landed and immediately performed a deep kowtow, pressing their entire bodies to the earth. Li Zhouwei gave a slight lift of his hand, and an invisible divine ability raised the deer demon to his feet. "There is no need for such ceremony," Li Zhouwei said softly.

"We traveled to the Northern Foothills, but we found the cave manor deserted and the Elder absent. We took the liberty of coming directly to the main peak. I hope you will not take offense."

This was Lu Ken, one of Bai Rong's subordinates, whom Li Zhouwei had met before. He was the one helped to his feet, yet he remained timid, barely daring to speak. The bear demon beside him, lacking this connection, remained prostrate on the ground.

Lu Ken quickly protested, "One must always kneel before a great lord! Furthermore, your Lordship's life-mandate is complete and you have reclaimed your divine ability. If I do not show proper respect at this moment, I fear it will damage my own meager fortune."

Li Zhouwei had no choice but to retract his power and allow him to complete the bow. Only then did Lu Ken rise, speaking with deep humility.

"It is not that I was unwilling to remain on the mountain to serve you, milord. But... the White Qilin bloodline has achieved its divine ability. The Northern Foothills... we dare not have a demon general who is not named Li, nor a master who does not bear scales. This lowly demon fears incurring Wei Huang's heavenly wrath, and so I did not dare to remain."

He was visibly terrified, and the bear demon beside him trembled like a leaf, still unable to rise. Li Zhouwei nodded. "Take me to the master of Mount Dali."

The deer demon immediately bowed low and led the way. As they walked, Li Zhouwei admired the winding, treacherous mountain paths and asked, "Since those with scales fall under the dominion of the White Qilin and the Shuyang, what Dao governs your deer clan?"

Lu Ken answered respectfully, "My kind follows the Dao of 'Purple Qi'."

'So, the Purple Qi... Elder Bai Rong *does* tread upon Purple Smoke. It all fits.'

With this understanding, he flew a short distance further and arrived at the summit of Mount Dali's main peak. He saw a pool of churning white water, wreathed in steam. A host of demons presented auspicious tributes, and the ground was carpeted with spirit fruits and herbs.

Lu Ken dared not proceed. The White Ape also stopped silently. Li Zhouwei continued on alone, walking several dozen paces through the ethereal, misty paradise until he saw a jade platform. A man was seated upon it.

The man's skin was flawless, like polished jade, and his features were soft and handsome, bordering on bewitching. He had a slender build and a graceful bearing, with a constant smile playing at the corners of his eyes. His entire expression was one of joy. He descended from the platform, beaming.

"Wherever the Qilin treads, life flourishes. Your arrival is truly Mount Dali's greatest blessing!"

"It is merely a quirk of fate. You praise me too highly, milord."

Li Zhouwei returned the courtesy, a golden light swirling in his eyes. 'A Demon King with three divine abilities... and none I recognize.'

Mount Dali held a stable position in Jiangnan. Though they had become more reclusive in recent years, no one dared to provoke them. They clearly possessed a deep foundation. This man alone was a noble scion of considerable cultivation.

The man smiled warmly and gestured for him to sit at a table. "I am the Demon King of Mount Dali," he said. "My family name is Qingyu, my given name is Qian, and my Daoist title is Tingfu. I have long heard of the great Minghuang!"

This was unexpected. The fox clans of Mount Dali almost universally used 'Bai' as their proper surname. Yet, this Demon King Tingfu was not named Bai, but Qingyu Qian.

"Greetings, Elder." Li Zhouwei immediately rose from his seat and bowed.

"Mount Dali has provided assistance for many years. The Li family would not be where it is today without your aid. I am deeply grateful. Thank you, Elder!"

Demon King Tingfu chuckled and shook his head. As a fox spirit in human form, his smile was captivating. He lifted a jade pot from the table and poured wine for Li Zhouwei. "That debt is not mine to claim."

Li Zhouwei completed his bow before returning to his seat. Demon King Tingfu raised his cup and offered a few words of congratulations. "Bai Rong, that child," he began.

"I was the one who elevated him from the common forest spirits. He is a junior I hold in high regard. Unfortunately, he is currently in seclusion deep in the mountains, nurturing his divine ability, so he cannot come out to greet you. It is a pity."

Li Zhouwei smiled. "When Elder Bai Rong emerges successful, I will certainly return to offer my congratulations."

After a few more pleasantries, Qingyu Qian's eyes curved in a smile as he finally got to the point. "I heard what happened with the Dragon-kin. A member of your clan was transformed into lightning, yes? That must be a gambit by Dragon Monarch Beijia, a piece placed on the board concerning the Bright Yang matter long ago. It's impossible that Luoxia is unaware... What I wish to know is, what is your view on this, Minghuang?"

Seeing him be so direct, Li Zhouwei replied, "In your opinion, Elder, is there any chance of escape?"

The fox and the dragon had made their pact in his presence. Li Zhouwei had to frame his question accordingly. Hearing it, Qingyu Qian replied softly, "Difficult."

Before Li Zhouwei could respond, Qingyu Qian continued in a pleasant tone, "While I have no love for Luoxia, the Dragon-kin are not easy allies either. Frankly, Luoxia may not even covet the Bright Yang. They simply do not wish for the Shuyang, the pivot standing above the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment to be Li Qianyuan. If you were to acquiesce to their wishes, you could still achieve the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment and become one of the great powers of this world."

His words were surprisingly moderate, favoring neither side. Li Zhouwei was clearly confused and remained silent for a moment before asking in a low voice, "Why do they hate him so much?"

After Li Zhouwei posed the question, Qingyu Qian sighed.

"Li Qianyuan is no ordinary man. There are few Fruition Attainments left in this world that represent sole mastery. He is but one step away from becoming a Dao Embryo. If he takes that step, he will be the first person in all of history to unite the roles of Celestial Emperor and true Immortal in one body."

"He has an irreconcilable conflict with Luoxia, and indeed, with more than half of all major Daoist traditions. This conflict isn't just about Dao paths, Daoist traditions, or divine abilities. It is rooted in old grudges, fundamental philosophies, and the very nature of cultivation."

Qingyu Qian's expression was grave. Li Zhouwei frowned. "But I have heard... in primordial times, there was a Human Emperor who established a great dynasty..."

Qingyu Qian took a sip of wine and shook his head. "That was a dynasty, yes, but not a *Celestial Dynasty*. A Celestial Dynasty, by definition, rules all under heaven. There is but one authority, the imperial authority. One father, the sovereign. How can that compare to the Zhou, which merely presided over its enfeoffed lords? To be blunt, the Great Zhou was nothing more than a powerful central state among many."

Li Zhouwei fell silent. The fox demon before him continued in a low voice:

"Do you understand now? We have the benefit of hindsight; history is a clear mirror for us. But how many understood at the time? Touba Xuantan also proclaimed a Celestial Dynasty. He had a deep foundation and the support of the Viewing Pavilion faction. And what was the fate of his Great Liang?"

"Look at Emperor Zhao, Fu Qiyan. He established the Great Zhao Dynasty. He ascended Mount Dayang, gazed out over the endless yellow sands, and said only: 'Dechang is dead, the Xiao-Wu are not pacified, the south remains a treacherous unknown. My great work is unfinished.' Did he give any thought to what would become of his descendants?"

"The Wei Emperor died suddenly in the sky; the Liang Emperor drowned in a river. Fu Qiyan was halfway through his conquest of Yan when he spoke those words and collapsed in Yincheng Prefecture. It is said even the trees and stones wept. The 'Body of Kui' Fruition Attainment of the Ancient Merging was lost forever from that day. Think! In ancient times, what was the Dharma Body of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? And what is it today?"

This barrage of questions left Li Zhouwei speechless. Qingyu Qian's tone softened.

"No imperial house has ever had both a good beginning and a good end. All the Dragon-kin hope to do is postpone his final fall; they have no illusions of his return. The people from Luoxia will seek you out eventually. You must be careful."

"Thank you for your guidance, milord."

Qingyu Qian's expression was somber, the smile gone from his eyes. Clearly, despite the pact between dragon and fox, Mount Dali held a deeply pessimistic view of the future. Li Zhouwei offered his thanks again, and they shifted the conversation to lighter topics, dispersing the heavy atmosphere that had settled within the white mist.

Having only just achieved his divine ability, Li Zhouwei still had many questions about the 'Children of Fate'. It was not a topic one could broach in ordinary company, as few truly understood it. His purpose in coming today was not just to pay respects, but also to seek answers.

"I have now reached the Purple Mansion Realm and awakened a divine ability," he began. "I can feel that my physical body is far stronger, and my eyes can perceive many things I could not before. But beyond that, the other benefits and drawbacksare still unclear to me."

"Elder Bai Rong once mentioned that upon reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, my state would be essentially no different from that of a Demon beast. I was hoping you could elaborate on this."

At this, Qingyu Qian nodded in understanding, then smiled. "You have certainly come to the right person. When it comes to the Life Divine Ability, I dare say Mount Dali's legacy is among the most complete."

His expression turned serious.

"A Fruition Attainment is a 'position,' but it is also a 'power' that constantly influences the world. This is why the two words are so often linked."

"Within the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, the Life Divine Ability is perhaps the most special. What does it cultivate? According to my Daoist tradition, it cultivates one's *connection* to a Fruition Attainment. The wonders of this divine ability are realized through the influence that its corresponding Fruition Attainment exerts upon the world. This is why cultivating a Life Divine Ability places such extreme emphasis on one's Dao-Profundity."

He took a sip of wine. "Some Dao lineages possess more than one Life Divine Ability. This simply means their chosen Fruition Attainment is 'higher' and places more emphasis on this connection. In the past, cultivators had to comprehend this path on their own. Imagine the difficulty! The genius of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao lies in its simplicity. It lowers the requirements for innate talent and Dao-Profundity."

"Unfortunately, the world has never been fair. Some have good luck, others good birth. By the same token, there exists a class of people who, whether through reincarnation, bloodline, circumstance, or even for no discernible reason at all receive the favor of a Fruition Attainment. They gain access to all its corresponding wonders. These are the people we call 'Children of Fate'."

"Such people often possess heaven-defying luck and are destined for great things. It is as if they are born with a piece of that connection, even if they are unaware of it. The moment they reach the Purple Mansion Realm, they find their Life Divine Ability manifests naturally, as easily as water flowing downhill."

His eyes curved, a smile ever-present in them. "This is true for you as well. Had you cultivated the 'World's Radiance', it would have manifested just as naturally. However, you also have a key difference from them."

"To explain this, we must discuss transformation. In the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, once a cultivator awakens their Body Divine Ability, more than eighty percent of them gain the power to change their shape. As long as the Shengyang Acupoint is intact, transforming into a bird or a fish is trivial. Most of these are just symbolic of a given Daoist tradition. Unless one studies a dedicated art of transformation, it's merely a change in appearance. It's not as useful as the human form, which is suited to myriad paths... After all, even we Demon beasts... seek to attain a human form."

"But Li Qianyuan has already ascended to his Fruition Attainment. How can he still be called human? It would not be an exaggeration to call him the Shuyang itself. As his descendant, the moment you received that favor, the Fruition Attainmentand the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment is one that *prizes* the bond between father and son would recognize you as the scion of the Shuyang. This is not transformation. It is what you *are*."

He narrowed his eyes slightly. "As for why you are a Qilin and not a Cicada, that is also obvious. You are the first to cause the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment to shift its gaze. You are, by default, the 'eldest son'the White Qilin. When you have perfected all five divine abilities, your status as the White Qilin will be sealed."

"If I am not mistaken, both the Dragon-kin and Luoxia have foreseen this. Luoxia, in particular, watches the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment intently. The instant you awakened your divine ability, they knew a White Qilin had descended upon the world."

Understanding dawned in Li Zhouwei's heart.

"If, one day, another person gains its favor," Qingyu Qian added, "that one will likely be the Cicada."

Li Zhouwei nodded slowly, then raised an eyebrow.

"But... this father-son connection... is Luoxia truly not afraid that the Wei Emperor left some contingency? That *he* intentionally allowed this to happen?"

"Hahahahaha!" The fox demon laughed aloud, but his tone shifted abruptly, becoming low and cold.

"Of course not. The Bright Yang is not just the seat of the sovereign father. It is also the seat of 'son slays father,' 'father kills son,' 'father steals son's love,' and 'son seizes father's power.' Only when all five aspects are united is it the *true* Bright Yang!"

"The Bright Yang abhors inversion. When the son is strong and the father is weak, how could the son *not* seize the throne?"

Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze, a profound chill seeping into his heart.

The mist over the pool swirled violently. After a heavy silence, Li Zhouwei replied, "Your knowledge is vast and your Dao-Profundity is deep, milord, far beyond the reach of ordinary men. This junior is filled with admiration and gratitude."

Qingyu Qian quickly regained his composure, smiling and shaking his head. "It is mainly because my Daoist tradition is complete. But speaking of true Dao-Profundity, I could never compare to the master from Purple Smoke. *He* is the one whose Dao-Profundity is truly profound, a scholar who bridges heaven and humanity."

Li Zhouwei knew at once he spoke of Daoist Master Zimu, the peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition who had vanished. "A pity that master's whereabouts are unknown," Li Zhouwei sighed.

Qingyu Qian did not elaborate, reining in the topic. He only smiled.

"His cultivation speed was terrifying. At the time, his talent was proclaimed the greatest in the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. He had more than enough talent to walk the Ancient Immortal Dao!"

He quickly changed the subject.

"The truth is, my divine ability is somewhat... peculiar. While sitting here, I can hear voices from the lands below. I have spent most of the last century in seclusion, so I actually know little about your clan. Most of what I know, I learned from my junior."

The Li family had long known that this Demon King could hear all things. It was impossible to know if he had overheard their conversations back when they were mere mortals, or in the Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining stages. It was an extremely sensitive matter, and a natural source of suspicion.

For him to admit it so openly now clearly meant he wished to clear the air. Li Zhouwei wasn't sure how to respond.

"Your divine ability is profound, milord... Is it the 'Celestial-Awakening Ear'?"

Demon King Tingfu smiled.

"The Li family of Wei truly has a deep foundation. Your guess is correct. It is a path unknown to ordinary people. Even in its golden age, there were never more than two or three Daoist traditions in the world that cultivated it."

At this, Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Then it must be a method from the Ancient Merging?"

It wasn't a difficult guess. The arts of Mount Wu were known to resonate with shamanic arts, yet they were not based on concrete elements like earth, water, wind, fire, lightning, or Spiritual Qi. It was almost certainly a path from the Ancient Merging.

Qingyu Qian poured him more wine, smiling but saying nothing. After a moment, he spoke softly.

"Having cultivated this divine ability, it is... impolitic to visit other's homes. After all, even if people are speaking at a great distance, they have their secrets and taboos. For this reason, I have rarely left this mountain for many years, save to witness the descendants of old friends break through to the Purple Mansion Realm or to observe a cultivator attempt to form their Golden Core."

"I am currently attempting to cross the immortal threshold. The opportunity has arrived, and my breakthrough draws near, so I travel even less. If I am fortunate enough to one day become a Great Demon King, then leaving the mountain would be an even greater offense to others!"

"However, Mount Dali possesses a complete Daoist tradition, and I have some small insight. If you have any questions you seek answers to, Minghuang, you are always welcome to ask."

Li Zhouwei readily agreed, thinking to himself, 'Compared to the Chunyi Dao Gate, Mount Dali seems far more reliable. When the time comes for the cave manor to appear, I will have a perfect excuse to return and ask.'
