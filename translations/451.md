# Chapter 639: Yuan Fuyao

Jiang Heqian sighed and glanced at Li Ximing. Suddenly, Li Ximing's curiosity was piqued, and he asked, "There is one question that troubles me. Back then, what happened to Fei Wangbai?"

"Wangbai?" Jiang Heqian took a few steps and seated himself at the head of the table. Picking up a teacup, he replied lightly, "Naturally, he was killed by an immortal sect."

"Which sect, if I may ask?" Li Ximing paused, his confusion evident.

Jiang Heqian immediately cursed, "How would I know? Do you think immortal sects are trustworthy? Even Yue Cultivating Sect—if their interests were threatened, they would kill without hesitation!"

Jiang Heqian continued, "Wangbai had a Shared Dao with Daoist Master Shangyuan of Yue Cultivating Sect. Yue Cultivating Sect has an alchemy technique that could refine him to nourish Shangyuan. Azure Pond Sect was bound to want him dead eventually!"

Jiang Heqian gave Li Ximing a sideways glance, and before he could respond, Jiang Heqian spoke casually, "But what about your Li Family? With your connection to the Bright Yang Dao Lineage, why did Li Tongya choose to cultivate Pit Water?"

Li Ximing replied evenly, "At the time, our family had fallen into decline. Cultivation resources were scarce, so he had no choice but to pursue Pit Water."

Jiang Heqian paused briefly, having only mentioned the topic in passing. Hearing Li Ximing's response, he felt no need to engage further in meaningless chatter and continued, "Since your esteemed family killed Yu Muxian, did you obtain the Foundation Establishment Realm artifact, Jade Smoke Mountain? After all, it was once an heirloom of my clan. If it is in your possession, I would like to offer an exchange."

Li Ximing shook his head and replied, "You misunderstand, senior. That person died within the grotto heaven but did not bring the artifact with him. It is likely still on Yuanwu Peak."

Jiang Heqian stroked his beard. Realizing the artifact's whereabouts were still uncertain, he sighed and asked, "The Yu Family is now scattered. Has your family made any follow-up arrangements?"

Li Ximing avoided delving too deeply into the matter and replied politely, "Such trivial matters hardly warrant troubling you, senior. Our elders have made appropriate arrangements."

Jiang Heqian chuckled and said, "Let me offer a word of advice, for the sake of old ties. Be cautious. The downfall of my family is still a recent memory. If another Jiang Family were to rise here, without earning the trust of Azure Pond Sect or Golden Feather Sect, it would surely be destined to splinter into pieces!"

His expression carried a hint of mockery, and his tone felt more like ridicule. Li Ximing found it difficult to respond and simply fist cupped in acknowledgment.

After a brief pause, Jiang Heqian continued softly, "I mean the trust of Azure Pond Sect, not Yuan Su. How much longer does Yuan Su have to live? He cannot secure anything for you!"

With a flick of his sleeve, Jiang Heqian threw out this statement, seeming to lose interest in the conversation. Lowering his gaze, he said, "Revenge has been served. The Yu Family's blood feud has been repaid in full. I will spend the rest of my days wandering the world. I will not return to the lakes. The Jiang Family is but a wisp of smoke now, and this matter ends here."

With that, he stepped out of the courtyard. As if remembering something, he retrieved an item from his storage pouch.

It was round and heavy, with black hair cascading down—a severed head. The eyes were clouded gray, the skin taut, and the mouth slightly ajar, revealing a dark, gaping void.

"This is Yu Mugao's head," he said, tossing it onto the ground before departing on the wind.

Li Ximing picked up the head and gave it a quiet glance. Yu Mugao had once sparred with Li Yuanjiao and others in secret, but this was the fate he had met. He gave instructions, "Take this to the elders and An Zheyan for them to see. Let it ease their grievances. Then, bring it to my uncle's grave as an offering to our ancestors."

Li Wushao bowed and carried the head away. Li Ximing, meanwhile, adjusted his robes and returned to his chambers to resume his secluded cultivation.

Yu Mugao's head was passed around among the clan members. Some wept, others laughed. For most of the elders, it was a moment of catharsis. However, none were as emotional as An Zheyan, who shed hot tears.

After it had made its rounds, Li Xuanxuan hurried down and took the head up the mountain.

Li Yuanxiu's death had been one of the greatest sorrows of Li Xuanxuan's life. Though he had endured much suffering, his hatred had not diminished—it had only deepened over time.

It was like his left eye, scarred by demonic flames. Though it caused no pain on ordinary days, when he squinted, it burned with a searing heat, a constant reminder that his wounds remained unhealed.

Li Yuexiang accompanied the old man up the mountain, watching as he spoke quietly to the gravestone. The severed head sat on the altar, motionless and silent.

Li Yuexiang stayed with him for half a day. Only when someone came up the mountain to summon her did she prepare to leave. Looking closely, she saw it was Li Wushao.

Li Wushao kneeled on one knee and said softly, "Miss, someone from the Yuan Family has arrived."

Li Yuexiang had no choice but to leave the graveyard. She descended the mountain and flew to the central hall of Lijing Town. Outside the hall stood a line of attendants. Before she even entered, she could already hear Li Chengliao's voice, "Senior, you are being too polite! There is no need for this!"

As she stepped inside, she saw two attendants at the rear and two individuals standing at the front.

One was an elderly man with neatly combed white hair, tall and imposing, with the cultivation level of an early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. He looked to be about 180 years old and wore a beaming smile.

The man was speaking earnestly, saying, "Do not say such things. Even this Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation of mine is thanks to Nephew Yuanjiao! Not to mention the Essence Gathering Pill he gave me, even the idea of breaking through was inspired by him!"

Li Yuexiang's arrival interrupted their conversation. Li Chengliao quickly stepped forward with a smile and said, "Aunt, you are here! This is Senior Yuan Huyuan and Young Master Yuan Fuyao."

The speaker was Yuan Huyuan, who had broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm at the age of 100. Though his success was largely due to the Essence Gathering Pill, it was undeniably a stroke of luck. The elderly man now appeared decades younger, radiating the demeanor of a high cultivator who had achieved the Dao.

As for the young man standing behind him, he was strikingly handsome, tall, and wore a calm expression. Draped in luxurious robes, he carried an air of nobility.

Given that Yuan Chengdun was already quite good-looking, Yuan Fuyao naturally inherited these traits. Among cultivators, his appearance was exceptional. Li Yuexiang glanced at him briefly and noticed the astonishment in his eyes as he looked at her.

Several chests of spirit treasures were displayed in the hall, indicating that Yuan Huyuan had gone to great lengths to show the importance of this visit.

Li Yuexiang responded politely, and Yuan Huyuan's joy was evident as he eagerly approached, speaking in a low voice, "I had some connections with your father… It is a pity what happened to you…"

Li Yuexiang, accustomed to such comments, quickly shifted the topic and turned her attention to Yuan Fuyao. Yuan Huyuan immediately began introducing him, saying some flattering words. Just then, another figure arrived.

The newcomer was an elderly man with white hair, hurrying in. It was Li Xuanxuan, whose aged voice carried a trace of apology. "I deeply apologize, Senior. All the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the family are currently in seclusion. Qinghong has gone to the Eastern Sea, so only a Qi Cultivator like me was available to greet you."

Yuan Huyuan waved his hand dismissively and replied, "It is no bother at all! With someone of your stature coming to receive me, it is already a great honor. Why should there be any formality between our two families?"

Their conversation was warm and friendly, full of mutual politeness, leaving Li Yuexiang and Yuan Fuyao awkwardly standing to the side. Seeing this, Li Xicheng smiled and said, "Yuexiang, why not take the young master to enjoy the lake scenery?"

The two left together, and only then did Yuan Huyuan's smile fade, his expression turning serious as he said, "Are you aware of the current state of my family?"

Li Xuanxuan hesitated for a moment before answering, "I know a bit."

Yuan Huyuan deliberated for a moment, his voice lowering as he said, "Now… if both Chengdun and the others do not return, the future will be hard to predict. Fuyao is Chengdun's only son. I can only entrust him to your family's care."

"This was something Chengdun arranged with you earlier…"

Yuan Huyuan's expression became increasingly strained. His aged face twitched slightly, and he finally said, "I have come here today, swallowing my pride, to ask if your family can spare a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to assist us…"

Li Xuanxuan was stunned, momentarily at a loss for words.

Thanks to Li Xizhi's earlier reminder, he already understood that the Yuan Family was in chaos, unsure of how deeply involved they were with Azure Pond Sect's plans. He had no intention of getting entangled.

While offering protection to Yuan Chengdun's descendants was a minor matter that wouldn't pose significant risks, actively intervening was an entirely different issue.

Being a cautious individual by nature, Li Xuanxuan only wanted to protect the family's prodigy for a few more years. The difficulty of the situation was clearly written on his face. Seeing this, Yuan Huyuan lowered his voice further and said, "I understand the trouble with Yuanjiao's situation and that your family is facing turbulent times… but as for my family…"

Yuan Huyuan understood his family's precarious situation all too well. Yet, as an elder, he desperately clung to the hope of salvaging what remained, unwilling to give up. Having exhausted every possible connection, he could only turn to the Li Family for help.

Li Xuanxuan sighed inwardly and decided to hint at his position. "Senior! This rain has lasted far too long!"

The words hit Yuan Huyuan like a bolt of lightning. He stepped back, realizing the Li Family was well aware of the Yuan Family's current state: the death of their ancestor Yuan Licheng, the disappearance of their backer Buzi, and their transformation into a pawn of Azure Pond Sect in their maneuvering against Yue Cultivating Sect. The risks were too great for the Li Family to intervene. With a bitter smile, he replied, "Very well… I can only entrust Fuyao to your care."

Li Xuanxuan offered some comfort. "Your family has deep roots. You will weather this storm."

Yuan Huyuan remained silent. Being at the eye of the storm left him little to say. He cupped his fist and took his leave.

Meanwhile, Li Yuexiang excused herself from the gathering. Yuan Fuyao walked alongside her as they exited the hall and sighed, "Watching them trade polite pleasantries feels so meaningless!"

Li Yuexiang lowered her gaze, blinking slightly, and responded, "Our two families have had a long-standing alliance. Naturally, there is much to discuss."

Yuan Fuyao nodded quickly, adopting an agreeable stance.

In truth, Yuan Fuyao had not been in a good mood during the journey. He was strongly opposed to the idea of an arranged marriage. However, Yuan Huyuan's authority was absolute, leaving him with no room to argue, and he begrudgingly accompanied the elder.

Along the way, he calculated ways to extricate himself. After all, the marriage had not been finalized yet. If he could find some excuse—such as incompatible personalities—it might still be possible to withdraw.

But as soon as he laid eyes on Li Yuexiang, he was utterly captivated. Her beauty was otherworldly, and all his grievances vanished like smoke. He stared at her, nodding repeatedly, his earlier thoughts entirely forgotten. He silently marveled, What a stunning woman! Such beauty is rare, even among cultivators!

Li Yuexiang appeared unaware of his admiration. She guided him across the lake, making casual conversation. Suddenly, Yuan Fuyao noticed the large dam spanning the lake and asked with some curiosity, "What is this for? Raising spirit fish?"

Li Yuexiang answered gently, "It is to block the lake water and protect the people."

Yuan Fuyao sighed repeatedly and said, "My family is far behind yours in this regard. With this endless rain, I have suggested several times to my family that we send cultivators to help manage things in the plains. But they always dismiss it as a waste of manpower."

It turned out that Yuan Fuyao, under Yuan Chengdun's arrangement, had been managing towns and commoners in Mushroom Forest Plain. With this opening, he began discussing matters of governance in detail—how to regulate livelihoods, manage the populace, and ensure their welfare. His insights were surprisingly profound.

Hearing this, Li Yuexiang nodded internally, though her expression remained calm and pleasant. She responded with a soft smile, "Cultivators may not fear the rain, but the people by the lake suffer greatly."

Yuan Fuyao had a moment of realization and, while his face betrayed no change, he thought, The Li Family's reputation for caring for its people is well-deserved.

Li Yuexiang had little interest in discussing such topics further. She redirected the conversation to inquire about recent news. Yuan Fuyao enthusiastically shared various tales and observations, speaking at length about distant lands and scattered events. Li Yuexiang listened politely without much engagement.

Suddenly, he asked, "Did my father leave any message or item for me when he visited your family?"

Li Yuexiang narrowed her eyes slightly, thinking to herself, It seems Yuan Chengdun went straight to the Eastern Sea without leaving any instructions for his family…

Without any intention of keeping the betrothal gifts for herself, she replied softly, "He did leave a betrothal gift. It is in the central hall. You may ask Senior Huyuan about it."

She hadn't expected that her words would cause Yuan Fuyao, who had been reserved and deferential, to suddenly straighten his back and lift his chin slightly. Confidence seemed to fill him, and he responded with a simple "Hmm."

The two chatted a while longer until Yuan Huyuan emerged from the hall, accompanied by a retinue. He addressed Yuan Fuyao, saying, "You will stay here to cultivate for now. For any matters, consult Yuexiang."

Yuan Fuyao seemed a bit caught off guard and could only nod blankly. Yuan Huyuan gave a polite smile to Li Yuexiang and then flew away on the wind.

Yuan Fuyao's cave dwelling had already been prepared. Li Yuexiang escorted him and his attendants there and quickly took her leave. Once inside, Yuan Fuyao instructed his attendants to inspect the dwelling, then sat down to drink tea.

On his left, one of his trusted aides asked, "Young Master, what do you think of the Li Family's young lady?"

Yuan Fuyao paused for a moment before praising, "She is truly a beauty, but she is also full of schemes."

The aide leaned in and asked quietly, "Full of schemes…?"

Yuan Fuyao nodded with some difficulty and said, "I have heard that she has an older brother cultivating within the sect who has already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. If I marry her, I am afraid my branch will only end up obeying the Li Family's commands."

The aides exchanged glances, unsure how to respond. They dared not speak ill of the woman from the Li Family. If she were to truly become their mistress and inquire into such matters, the consequences would not be light. Suddenly, Yuan Fuyao spoke again in a low voice, "Go and find out how much my father prepared for the Li Family. See if there is any way to reclaim it."

The aide quickly excused himself, while Yuan Fuyao remained seated, pondering silently. "I need to find a way to retrieve those resources. I cannot keep living under the Li Family's shadow, with everything falling into their hands."

————

Meanwhile, Li Yuexiang had returned. Li Xuanxuan soon came to find her, having just finished receiving updates. He hurried over, determined to assess matters for his granddaughter. Upon seeing Li Yuexiang enter, he quickly asked, "How was it?"

Li Yuexiang waved her hand dismissively and, seeing that her grandfather didn't appear overly concerned, replied, "This Yuan Fuyao seems to understand the needs of the common people. Beyond that, he is rather glib and seems to possess a bit of cleverness. His personality, however, leans toward mediocrity and greed. That said, his actions appear to remain within the bounds of propriety. Whether it is genuine or merely a façade, I will need to observe him further."

"What?!" Li Xuanxuan was taken aback and blurted, "How can he be like that! Are you sure you have judged him correctly?"

Li Yuexiang, relying on her own observations, began to feel slightly uncertain under her grandfather's questioning. She responded hesitantly, "I have not met too many people while on the mountain, so perhaps my assessment is not entirely accurate. It is just unfortunate that my brother is in seclusion…"

Li Xuanxuan waved his hand dismissively and said, "That makes it easier. I will have Li Chengliao and the others test him. There is no need for you to deal with this yourself."
