# Chapter 1199: Shaoshang

He knelt before the hall and wept, a raw and cathartic release. He cried until his limbs burned and a fire scorched his heart and lungs, purging the last of the chill that had seeped from his core into his very bones. Only when the cold was gone could he finally rise to his feet.

‘I should burn incense and perform ablutions,’ he thought. ‘Only then would it be truly respectful.’

He lowered his head and scanned the rubble-strewn ground. Tapping his foot, he heard a hollow sound. He brushed away a few shards of stone and found a small, silvery puddle gleaming in a crevice.

‘There must have been a pool before this great hall.’

He carefully scooped up a handful of water to wash his face, then retied his hair. Only then did he begin his ascent to the great hall, prostrating himself with every step. Though the doors were battered by time, they still stood firm, concealing all within.

Yuanshang gave the door a gentle push, and it swung open with surprising ease. A soft light spilled in from outside, illuminating a floor as pristine as jade. The interior was unexpectedly intact. The light glanced off towering jade pillars, and within their depths, the Profound Patterns of the Moon Laurel seemed to flow with a faint, silver liquid.

Restraining a tremor of both apprehension and excitement, he stepped inside. He knelt in the vast, empty hall and spoke with solemn reverence.

"Xi Shaoshang, a humble disciple of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, under the Azure Profoundity Great Dao, Gonghua Dao-path, and Mirrored-Mirage Lineage, greets this sacred place. Having received its radiance and endured its trials, I have ascended to see the Heavenly Pool. Today, I have attained the state of Woven Jade, and I request an audience... with the emissary of the Supreme Yin."

He recited the incantation passed down through his tradition, his voice low, but the cavernous hall offered no reply save the faint echo of his own words.

A premonition had already taken root in Yuanshang's heart. He remained kneeling for the time it takes an incense stick to burn before finally speaking again.

"This disciple means no offense..."

With that, he rose and followed the sliver of light from the entrance deeper into the hall.

An octagonal altar, exquisite and noble, gradually emerged from the shadows. Though it bore no obvious carvings, it seemed to glow with a faint, crystalline moonlight. The jade meditation cushion atop it was empty. He had no choice but to venture further in.

The hall was far larger than it appeared from the outside, its ceiling growing higher the deeper he went. Every ten paces, a jade table and a cushion were set to either side. Yuanshang's vision was poor in the gloom, and he dared not touch anything indiscriminately. By the time he reached the far end, he mentally calculated the positions.

‘There must be... thirty-two altars.’

In the deepest recess, he finally saw the hall's main seat. It was so dark he couldn't see his own hand before his face, yet he could just make out a constellation of magnificent Profound Patterns glowing faintly upon it. Not daring to approach, Yuanshang stopped below.

‘The Profound Hall is mostly intact, but it's completely empty. It looks as if no one has been here for many, many years…’

He pinched his fingers, calculating the passage of time, and his heart sank.

‘It makes sense... In ancient times, Woven Jade Immortals were numerous, but they've been exceedingly rare since the Middle Ages. The Dan and Han Families also fell into decline... It must have been at least a thousand years since the last one…’

‘But the Great Dao of the Supreme Yin... how could it have fallen to such a state!’

Yuanshang's gaze grew heavy, and a shadow fell over his initial joy.

‘And what about me? What am I now? A Woven Jade? A Daoist Master? I don't have a single divine ability. If I examine myself closely, I feel no different from a mortal!’

He might have attained the state of Woven Jade, but Yuanshang remembered with perfect clarity that he had, in fact, died on the mountain of the Chunyi Dao Gate.

It was said that when a True Monarch first achieved their station, their position was unstable, making them vulnerable. This period was known as the calamity of ascension, and countless True Monarchs had fallen at this final threshold. Both the former Qi and the later Zhao Imperial Monarchs had perished shortly after attaining the Dao. While a Woven Jade couldn't be called a True Monarch, they should at least possess a Profound Mystery locus. He couldn't sense the Supreme Yin at all. In the eyes of the Underworld, he was nothing more than a Demon, easily suppressed by a Dharma Treasure. His Dao-Profundity, his very soul—all had vanished like a puff of smoke.

‘Perhaps... perhaps the Woven Jades of old truly had a Profound Hall like this... one that could do nothing more than preserve my life. My divine abilities, my cultivation... they're truly gone, scattered to the winds.’

Lost in a fog of confusion, he retreated and closed the great Profound Gate behind him. He descended the steps and gazed at the other islands floating in the sky, but he lacked the power to fly up and explore them. He lowered his head.

‘No matter what happened,’ he thought darkly, ‘how could the Ancestral Court of the Supreme Yin be reduced to such a pathetic state?’

He began, silently, to clear the courtyard.

Ever since he'd started cultivating, Yuanshang had rarely needed to move things with his physical body. The scattered rubble, fragments of pavilions and halls, was heavy and dense. He painstakingly moved the stones piece by piece, piling them beside the great hall. Along the way, he found several pieces of broken jade, which he used to patch the damaged sections of the Profound Hall.

He worked with a sense of forlorn purpose. When exhaustion claimed him, he would simply lie down amidst the ruins to rest. This body of his required neither food nor water and would quickly recover its vitality. Then he would rise and continue his work. He lost track of time, but eventually, he cleared all the debris from the front of the hall, revealing a smooth, white jade plaza.

Just as he'd suspected, there was a crescent-shaped pool before the hall. Though it was choked with rubble, the water within was still clear and bright. A bridge might have once spanned it, but now only a few stone pylons remained. Yuanshang rested for a moment, then rolled up his sleeves and waded into the pool to clear it.

He glanced down at his reflection and froze.

Reflected in the pristine water was a young man. He had a straight nose and high brow ridges, though his cheeks were gaunt. It was the face of a true Daoist. The sight made Yuanshang raise a hand to his own cheek, his fingers tracing the skin still damp with tears.

‘This is me... from back when I had just reached the Foundation Establishment Realm…’

It truly felt as if a lifetime had passed. He took two steps forward, and his eyes caught another object reflected perfectly on the water's surface.

It was a token.

The pure white tablet, about the length of his forearm, was adorned with silver Supreme Yin patterns. A perfect circle in its center gave it an air of incomparable nobility. It was just there, reflected in the water, hanging inexplicably at the waist of his own reflection. The young man touched his own empty hip, then raised a trembling hand toward the image in the water.

The water was ice-cold, yet somehow his fingers closed around the solid form of the token. He gently lifted it from the pool. As it cleared the water, an ancient seal script character materialized within the central circle:
【Xi】.

A flush of heat spread across his face as excitement and joy surged through him. Yuanshang couldn't resist reaching out to gently touch the character.

The moment he did, an intense coolness flooded his mind. He felt a powerful, pulling sensation, as if he were being drawn through layers of clouds. Suddenly, a vision appeared: a grand pavilion shrouded in mist, from which the faint, melodious plinking of music could be heard.

“This… is…”

…

‘That damned dog Chi is completely useless!’

Dangjiang set down his brush with a heavy sigh. He pulled back his sleeve to look at the token within; it remained utterly colorless. Feeling even more exasperated, he glanced upward.

White mist churned within the pavilion. A woman dressed in tea-white silken robes sat at her desk, writing silently with her brush. He had no choice but to look away and swallow his frustration.

Dangjiang couldn't remember how long he had been slaving away like this. Chi Buzi had descended to the mortal realm, and not a word had been heard from him since. Dangjiang’s days were an endless cycle of revising cultivation techniques.

Fortunately, Immortal Official Li’s assignments weren’t entirely monotonous. The number of scrolls sent to his pavilion had decreased recently. Seizing the opportunity for a brief respite, he went to visit Shaohui’s pavilion—the only place he dared to go.

He paced restlessly below. Shaohui, seated above, eventually noticed and cast a glance his way.

Her own days had been much quieter. She specialized in the Lesser Yin and lacked Dangjiang's broad, if shallow, knowledge. She had recently received a gift from the Zhengao—a journal written by a predecessor.

This journal was astonishing. An occasional line would contain a profound insight that pointed directly to the essence of the Lesser Yin, and reading it was like sipping the finest wine. Shaohui was completely captivated, unwilling to waste a single moment. But Dangjiang's incessant sighing finally broke her concentration. She raised an eyebrow.

“It will be a while yet,” she said. “When that fellow Chi arrived in the heavens, he had only mastered his fourth divine ability. He is still a long way from perfecting them all; it cannot be rushed. Besides, with his cautious nature, he won't attempt the Quest for Gold unless he is either forced into it or absolutely certain of success.”

Dangjiang sighed again.

“This subordinate understands, but… the method for the Quest for Gold is precious… It looks like he’ll never recover his memories on his own. Where is he supposed to get enough immortal merit to trade for it? I…”

Before he could finish, the woman on the main seat seemed to sense something. She looked up, her expression one of surprise, and hurried from her seat to the pavilion entrance.

“I wonder which colleague has come to call?” she asked politely.

Shaohui was not a direct subordinate of the Supreme Yin. Assigned to this remote corner of the heavens, she rarely received visitors, unless an immortal official arrived bearing an order from the Zhengao. It was the first time Dangjiang had ever seen her so surprised. His eyes lit up, and he too stood, feigning a respectful air as he moved to greet the guest.

But he saw a young man standing blankly in the courtyard. He possessed a certain transcendent, immortal air, yet his eyes were wide with shock and confusion. He glanced around at the serving maids, utterly lost, and only snapped out of his daze when the celestial attendant emerged from the hall to greet him.

With his cultivation completely gone, he had no way of discerning the power of the woman before him. Judging by her appearance and aura, however, she had to be a great cultivator. He ventured a bow.

“This humble cultivator greets you, My Lady!”

The bow gave Shaohui a fright. She saw at a glance that he was dressed in the robes of the Supreme Yin and quickly stepped aside to avoid the gesture. She hurried to help him up.

“I am Shaohui, a Wu-Gui Celestial Attendant of the Lesser Yin,” she said quickly. “May I ask which pavilion or manor you serve? As you are wearing the attire of the Supreme Yin, I cannot possibly accept such a bow!”

Her words made the young man look up. He stared at her, a strange feeling blooming in his chest.

‘A Wu-Gui Celestial Attendant of the Lesser Yin... and a Lesser Yin cultivator... She doesn't seem like a True Monarch, more like an attendant to someone of high station. And she said... my robes are of the Supreme Yin…’

For a man like Yuanshang, who had become a Great Daoist Master and even touched upon the state of Woven Jade, his intellect was second to none. He absorbed these details in an instant. He murmured:

“Which pavilion? Which manor?”

He took a deep breath.

“Pavilion... manor... I do not know them. This humble cultivator came from the Hall of Final Vastness!”

As he spoke, Shaohui was observing him closely. She felt he was as ethereal as light, a puzzle to be solved. But when she heard the words "Hall of Final Vastness," she froze.

‘I've never heard of such a place…’

She thought for a moment, then asked:

“Is it in this realm?”

Yuanshang looked up and replied tentatively,

“I believe not... It is a place where the Woven Jade reside…”

A look of pure shock filled Shaohui's eyes. She asked:

“Daoist friend... you are a Woven Jade Immortal?!”

A Woven Jade Immortal was no ordinary being! Even without a formal station, they were figures on par with True Monarchs. And to be under the command of a Supreme Yin Immortal Lord made them even more significant. If this man was truly a Woven Jade, she should be the one bowing to him!

The title seemed to give Yuanshang a pillar to lean on. His eyes brightened, but then he saw Shaohui quickly shake her head. She asked:

“Or are you perhaps a subordinate under a Woven Jade?”

Yuanshang raised his brow, finally seeing an opening to speak. He said in a low voice:

“This humble cultivator is Xi Shaoshang. A cultivator from the Chunyi Dao Gate, of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition under the Azure Profoundity Great Dao, Gonghua Dao-path, and Mirrored-Mirage. I was seeking to become a Woven Jade... As for what I am now... I can no longer tell...”

The woman showed little reaction to his words, but for Dangjiang, standing behind her, they were like a thunderclap. His eyebrows shot up.

He, Dangjiang, had traveled the mortal world!

He had not only traveled it, but had seen its myriad wonders through the eyes of Chi Buzi. He had read countless ancient texts and even studied the core secrets of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. How could he not know of the Chunyi Dao Gate?

A newly ascended Woven Jade, claiming to be from Chunyi, with the surname Xi... it took only a moment's thought for the pieces to click into place. He gasped in horror:

“Xi Shaoshang… Are you the venerable Daoist Master Yuanshang?! You... you became a Woven Jade!”

Yuanshang's hesitant expression froze. Every scenario he had imagined—every possible reaction from these powerful beings, the fear of his lineage and his past being laid bare—was instantly shattered.

He had never, ever expected to hear someone call him ‘venerable Daoist Master Yuanshang’!

The familiar, respectful tone was that of a junior from the Eastern Sea, or perhaps a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from his own tradition. It was a tone he had heard a thousand times, but one that should have been impossible to hear in a place like this!

Dangjiang's shocked cry left even Shaohui momentarily stunned. Yuanshang stared back at him, his expression a mixture of bewilderment and shock. He said, his voice hoarse:

“Daoist friend... who... are you?”

Dangjiang knew how difficult attaining the Woven Jade state was, and his shock was far greater than Yuanshang's. His first thought was of Chi Buzi.

‘Look at this man!’ he cursed internally. ‘And you're still dragging your feet on the Quest for Gold…’

Dangjiang believed his memories were lost, but in truth, the most vibrant part of his short existence had been the time he spent roaming the world inside Chi Buzi. The daily battles of wit with the man were far more exciting than the monotonous life in the heavens. Though he had never actually met Yuanshang, hearing that name now filled him with the bittersweet ache of meeting an old countryman in a foreign land. He sighed.

“Years ago, I traveled the Eastern Sea in search of cultivation techniques. It was then I heard of the venerable master's great name... I never imagined we would truly meet here! My name... is Dangjiang!”

Yuanshang's premonition was confirmed. His astonishment deepened, but he could not place this person at all. He had certainly never heard of a Daoist Master Dangjiang. He murmured:

“Dang… Jiang?”

Dangjiang immediately realized the other man had no idea who he was. He said:

“Back then… I… I was…”

He was about to explain, but his origins were terribly complicated and involved numerous secrets. The words were on the tip of his tongue, but he couldn't force them out. After a moment of agonizing frustration, he finally managed:

“At that time, I was still Chi Buzi.”

“What?”

The name struck Yuanshang like a bolt of lightning. An icy chill crept into his heart, so profound that he forgot all about the woman standing before him. Only one, impossible name echoed in his mind:

‘Chi... Bu... Zi...? From the Supreme Yin? An Immortal Official?’
