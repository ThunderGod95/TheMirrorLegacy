# Chapter 878: Radiant Sun King's Halberd

The old man holding the tray stepped forward, presenting the Radiant Sun King's Halberd to Li Ximing with both hands. Li Ximing took it gently. A scalding heat met his grasp, and the patterns across the weapon's surface pulsed, flickering between light and darkness.

Tian Sanglin inspected it closely before continuing:

"This item was suspended in the top pavilion of the Fubei Peak in the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. According to Ning Tiaoxiao, the grotto-heaven's master was named Li Guangfu. He was not wealthy or extravagant; he had fallen on hard times. When the various families stormed the grotto-heaven, the estate was almost completely empty."

"The master had packed everything away, leaving behind only the Radiant Sun King's Halberd—a symbol of power and glory. The Cui Family respected him deeply; it seems no one ever dared to take the Radiant Sun King's Halberd."

Li Ximing listened intently. Tian Sanglin dismissed the old man with a wave and said:

"The body of the halberd should be made from 'Sun-Extending Grace Copper', smelted with the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual materials 'Li-Light Origin Essence' and 'Celestial Shade Stone'. That is why it possesses the glow of Li Fire."

"When Ning Tiaoxiao retrieved this item back then, he considered that it was unsuitable for Ning Wan's Cold Qi. However, Bright Yang and Li Fire are aligned, which was perfect for helping me refine my dharma body..."

Li Ximing nodded slightly and asked:

"Senior, to be honest, I only recently reached the Purple Mansion Realm and have been without a suitable weapon. This time, I entrusted the Supreme Yang Dao to communicate with you about this item, hoping to arrange a trade."

After all, Li Ximing was here specifically to find a good Spiritual Artifact. If the other party was unwilling to trade, or saw no need for it, then no amount of words would matter.

Tian Sanglin heard this and nodded.

"Zhaojing, do not overthink it. Since Ning Wan asked me about this, and I agreed to let you see it, I naturally have my own intentions."

Li Ximing smiled and nodded, and the other man began to explain:

"Bright Yang is, after all, tyrannical and overbearing. And this is a king's halberd. After I finished refining my dharma body, I found it wasn't very compatible with my Dao of Shamanic Arts and Talismans. Its uses are rather unconventional, and it's a bit cumbersome in combat. It's already difficult to use against enemies, but you absolutely cannot let it miss. If an attack fails to connect, it will instead damage your own Divine Ability and dharma power."

When Li Ximing heard this, he understood that this Spiritual Artifact could coordinate with his own Divine Ability. When his Audience with the Celestial Gate suppressed an enemy, he could follow up with a strike from the halberd. He suspected that without a Body Divine Ability, it would be nearly impossible to dodge.

'As expected, one's own Divine Abilities and one's own Spiritual Artifacts have the best synergy...'

Li Ximing had seen so many Merciful Ones recently, and the worry in his heart grew heavier by the day. Seeing such a Spiritual Artifact now, it was impossible not to be moved. He stroked his beard and said:

"I wonder, what does Senior require?"

Tian Sanglin rose from his throne and clapped his hands.

"First, this king wants the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury!"

This declaration made Li Ximing fall silent, clearly hesitant.

The Nine-Colored Profound Mercury had been obtained from the siege that killed Wang Fu. A prestigious Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item had fallen into the Li family's hands. It was only because Hengzhu valued their reputation and upheld the righteous path that they had preserved it for the Li family. If it had been any other Daoist tradition, even if they didn't seize it outright, they would have likely forced a trade for it long ago.

Later, when Li Ximing reached the Purple Mansion Realm, the item was sent to Moongaze Lake. It had always been reserved for Li Que'wan to use for her Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough. He had never considered touching it...

But if it could be traded for a Bright Yang Spiritual Artifact, Li Ximing wouldn't hesitate for long. His priority was to increase his own strength and stabilize the situation before Li Zhouwei broke through. If any changes occurred in the upcoming matter of the True Monarch, a Spiritual Artifact would be far more useful than the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury collecting dust in the treasury.

'As for Que'Wan... she is still far from the Purple Mansion Realm. We can wait until Zhouwei comes out of seclusion and make new plans then.'

But Tian Sanglin wasn't finished. He turned his head and continued:

"Besides that item, I also want a spirit pill, the 'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill'. It comes from the Great Ning Palace. It is not in your hands, but the Si Family has some, Gao has some, and even the Three Sects and Seven Gates have a portion..."

But even after saying this, he still didn't stop.

"And without this Spiritual Artifact, the foundation of my Southern Songzhou Luoshe will be weakened. I will need at least one spirit embryo to compensate. Naturally, this means you will trade one Upper Shaman spirit embryo to my Southern Songzhou Luoshe as part of the price."

Li Ximing had been hoping Tian Sanglin would ask for help suppressing a Maha. After all, he was already mortal enemies with the Buddhist cultivators; at worst, he'd get injured, but the Spiritual Artifact would be a concrete gain. Unfortunately, the Southern Songzhou Luoshe was already firmly rooted in Songzhou and had no mortal enemies, leaving no such opening to exploit.

Every condition was a major loss. He frowned, deeply dissatisfied. In short, not only did the Southern Songzhou Luoshe want to rake in both a spirit pill and a spiritual item, they *also* demanded a spirit embryo as compensation!

'This price is truly too high...'

He slowly sat up straight and said softly:

"Senior, the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury is already an exceptionally rare spiritual item in this world, especially in this age where the Whole Pill is elusive. Demanding that is one thing, but you also want the Supreme Yang Dao's 'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill' and an Upper Shaman spirit embryo."

"If this junior had that much influence, I wouldn't have needed to come to the Southern Sea. I could have just sought out some friends and had a Spiritual Artifact refined myself. Wouldn't that be better!"

Li Ximing maintained a pleasant expression and smiled.

"If this item were Xiukui's Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, this junior wouldn't say another word. I would throw in the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger I have on hand without a moment's hesitation. ...But as Senior himself said, this Spiritual Artifact is quite cumbersome, not some extraordinarily profound object."

Tian Sanglin was old, his gaze sharp and venomous. He didn't budge an inch, shaking his head.

"That's not right. The Nine-Colored Profound Mercury is precious, but are 'Li-Light Origin Essence', 'Sun-Extending Grace Copper', and 'Celestial Shade Stone' any less so? The difference in value is merely being covered by one pill and one spirit embryo! It is already a very appropriate offer."

He laughed loudly and said:

"I don't know whether to call you lucky, fellow Daoist. Anyone else... would only know this item is cumbersome. Even if you got your hands on it, it probably wouldn't be much better, aside from having some novel effects when paired with your Divine Ability. ...But I have some worldly knowledge. I have actually seen another King's Halberd!"

"Precisely because it is a King's Halberd, in the hands of the strong, it can look down upon the world; in the hands of the weak, it is a source of disaster. Once this Spiritual Artifact falls into the hands of a cultivator whose Bright Yang Divine Ability has reached great completion, it reveals an entirely different bearing!"

Tian Sanglin truly did not look like a good person. He already had the appearance of a demonic fiend, and now his gaze was laden with deep meaning. His smile was even more sinister.

"Therefore, I know what I'm looking at. This item... is a truly fine thing in the eyes of your clan..."

His attitude was absolute and left no room for negotiation. In his heart, Li Ximing actually knew that while the demands stung, they weren't entirely excessive. Still, he sighed:

"I have some methods for refining a spirit embryo. Although I am not versed in the path of the Upper Shaman... I can still ask Xiukui for guidance. But this 'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill'... spirit pills are so valuable. I will have to expend an unknown amount of resources and favors..."

Tian Sanglin said nothing, merely sipping his tea from the head seat. Li Ximing's eyelid twitched as he watched. He was just about to speak again when a gray wind swept in from outside the hall, coalescing into a young man at the entrance.

The man was tall and thin, dressed in black robes and black boots, looking every bit the part of a demonic cultivator. He had a red mark on his glabella, gray strips of cloth tied around each sleeve, a jade token at his waist, and a large bow strapped to his back. His face was slightly sallow, giving him the appearance of a hunter.

He entered the main hall and strode forward. Upon suddenly seeing Li Ximing, his pupils widened slightly, as if he recognized him instantly, revealing a trace of shock.

The demonic cultivator concealed his emotions in an instant. His eyes held a peculiar light as he first bowed to Tian Sanglin.

"Greetings, Great King!"

Tian Sanglin nodded. The young man quickly turned, his voice surprisingly gentle as he spoke.

"I am Jiao Zhongzi. Greetings, Daoist Friend Zhaojing."

Li Ximing saw him enter from outside the hall, head held high, chest out, and bow on his back. He was momentarily lost in thought and cleared his throat.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist..."

Li Ximing was slightly embarrassed and replied:

"Regarding past events... I apologize for any offense."

Jiao Zhongzi waved his hand dismissively and sat down to the side, smiling.

"I heard from the Miao Family that a cultivator had come to the Southern Songzhou Luoshe to trade for a Spiritual Artifact. So it was you, Daoist Friend Zhaojing. You must be here for the Radiant Sun King's Halberd!"

He was clearly a practitioner of shamanic arts and talismans, yet a flame flickered faintly on his glabella. Li Ximing noted this discreetly and said with a wry smile:

"Indeed. It's just that my lake is poor, and I'm afraid I cannot satisfy the Senior's demands."

"Oh?"

Jiao Zhongzi acknowledged this, glancing silently at Tian Sanglin at the head seat. They seemed to exchange a look, and Jiao Zhongzi smiled.

"It seems we must trouble you to refine a spirit embryo. This isn't my Great King trying to make things difficult for you. My Dao of Shamanic Arts and Talismans is not like the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. We don't have methods for refining spirit embryos. You could say we should just nourish one slowly, but we lack the corresponding Daoist tradition. Only you Purple Mansion Golden Core cultivators have cultivated the Upper Shaman path, so we can 'borrow' it for a bit..."

This Jiao Zhongzi was clearly much more eloquent than Tian Sanglin, and his attitude was surprisingly amicable. He smiled.

"My Great King has one for himself, but I have not had a spirit embryo since my breakthrough. So I was hoping you could help... Whether you need a specific type of dharma artifact or any materials, feel free to ask."

The implication had changed completely. Tian Sanglin had demanded he *provide* a spirit embryo, but from Jiao Zhongzi's mouth, it became *helping to refine* one. That was a far easier task. Li Ximing's eyes lit up. He glanced over; Tian Sanglin was still silent, seemingly giving his tacit approval.

Li Ximing was immediately tempted. He nodded, while remaining inwardly vigilant:

'Could this old one and this young one be playing good cop, bad cop, setting an exorbitant price only to negotiate down?'

But just as Jiao Zhongzi smiled, satisfied, and was about to say more, Tian Sanglin spoke up, his voice raspy.

"If you agree, fellow Daoist, the matter is settled. If not, then please return... There is no precedent for 'lending' a Spiritual Artifact."

Li Ximing stood and bowed.

"Thank you for your understanding, Senior. It's just that, first, the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury is back at the lake. Second, this junior is unfamiliar with the 'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill'. I must ask a friend about it before I can agree."

Tian Sanglin frowned slightly, but Jiao Zhongzi stood up, smiling.

"That is only proper!"

He turned to Tian Sanglin and said respectfully:

"There is no need to trouble the Great King. Why don't I take the dharma artifact and the Spiritual Artifact and accompany Daoist Friend Zhaojing on his trip? If the deal is feasible, we can exchange the Spiritual Artifact on the spot and I will bring the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury back for you. With the Supreme Yang Dao as a witness, all subsequent matters will be easy to handle!"

Li Ximing understood immediately.

'This Southern Songzhou Luoshe King is actually very tempted by the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury...'

This proposal was exactly what Li Ximing wanted, and it also smoothed Tian Sanglin's furrowed brow. He nodded, gave Li Ximing a brief signal, and dissipated into black smoke.

Li Ximing thanked the young man before him, and they stepped into the Great Void together. He felt a little emotional and tested the waters:

"I had thought there was still some misunderstanding between us. I must thank you for helping this come to fruition!"

"Helping?"

Jiao Zhongzi chuckled and turned his head.

"Not at all... If I missed this opportunity with you, who knows how long it would be until the King finds a spirit embryo for me. I am naturally the most anxious one. After all, we are not on good terms with Xiukui, and it's difficult to find help elsewhere."

"And since this spirit embryo is destined for my pocket, its efficacy, its wondrous properties, and which type suits me best—these are things only I truly care about!"

His candid explanation made Li Ximing nod, though he remained half-convinced. They headed toward the mainland together, and Li Ximing smiled.

"What happened with Baoqing?"

"Him?"

This Eastern Yue man showed a hint of schadenfreude.

"The Temple Master of the Great Konghai Temple didn't lift a finger. So, naturally, Baoqing obediently discarded his dharma body and fled to the Buddhist Land. Shitang has now been carved up by the various families. You could say it was a happy ending for everyone."

He and Tuodu had discussed this at sea. It was easily the sloppiest battle Li Ximing had fought since reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. He strongly agreed with the assessment and felt new doubts about the Great Konghai Temple's strategy. He probed:

"Baoqing seized Shitang, catching Azure Pond off guard. But without the prestige of the Supreme Yang Dao, he could never have held it for long."

Jiao Zhongzi clasped his hands behind his back and smiled, shaking his head.

"Not so. Zhaojing, you must understand, that Temple Master, Jinghai, has not reincarnated in a hundred years. Not only has he not reincarnated, he cannot even leave the Buddhist Land!"

"Why hasn't the Master of the Great Konghai Temple reincarnated after all these years? Is it because he doesn't want to? It's because his temple lacks a dharma-image at its peak, and his position is unstable! This expanse of Buddhist Land absolutely requires someone to sit amidst the heavenly rain of mandara flowers and preside over it."

"So, for all these years, Jinghai has been in an extremely awkward position, having to tear down the east wall to repair the west wall. He finally managed to secure a position, but after long consideration, he wouldn't give it to anyone. He gave it to Baoqing, who has a blood feud with Azure Pond... This was purely out of fear..."

"After all, the moment he leaves, he must vacate the position of presiding over the Buddhist Land. He is terrified that someone will steal his position in the future, so he had to find a Maha who would be forced to rely on him."

Jiao Zhongzi sneered.

"And look at the result. Not only did Baoqing return heavily injured and unable to move, barely maintaining the Buddhist Land, he also made mortal enemies of nearly every surrounding power. What can he dare to do? He can only continue to be Jinghai's dog!"

Li Ximing understood at once. The lingering doubts in his mind about the Shitang affair vanished. The conversation stopped there, but he quickly formed another conclusion:

"Since Jinghai achieved his goal, it was actually Azure Pond that suffered the greatest loss. In the end, it was the other families who carved up Azure Pond's territory in Shitang."

The two traveled through the Great Void for a while and soon arrived at Lake Xian. Jiao Zhongzi stopped, wary. The flame on his glabella flickered faintly as he said softly:

"Daoist friend, please go retrieve the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury."

Li Ximing nodded. He rose up as a beam of light, moving a short distance away. He felt slightly uneasy. He used the jade talisman at his waist to contact Ning Wan and waited a moment, sending a call of light through the Great Void.

Only a moment passed before wind and snow gathered, and Ning Wan arrived, riding the blizzard. She smiled upon seeing Li Ximing and said gracefully:

"Congratulations, Zhaojing, on your safe return! The Great One also sent a sword over and has already taken Fei Qingya away. Her future affairs have been entrusted to Xiukui."

Li Ximing let out a sigh of relief and offered his thanks. Ning Wan smiled politely and asked:

"The Southern Songzhou Luoshe... did the negotiations go well?"
Li Ximing replied:

"More or less settled. They just want one 'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill'. They said the Supreme Yang Dao has a share... Do you know what it is? Is it considered precious?"

Ning Wan thought for a moment.

"That item should be from the Great Ning Palace. It's a spirit pill from the 'True Qi Dao' and has been lost for many years. Back then, three pills were left stored in a great cauldron. There were four cauldrons in total, for twelve pills. The Si Family obtained one cauldron; it was Xuanfeng who retrieved it."

"This 'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill' was a red-hot commodity in ancient times. It was a great treasure used by the Ning State to unite the various families. It was said to 'Support the Nine Qi, Equalize and Ancientize, Condense Talismans, and Embellish Divine Abilities.' I don't know how those heretical paths use it, but for our Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, it can slightly assist a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in catalyzing their immortal foundation into a Divine Ability!"

Li Ximing nodded, and Ning Wan continued:

"Of the Si Family's three pills, Senior Yuanxiu has certainly used one. The remaining two are in Si Yuanli's hands, but he is currently in seclusion... If he succeeds, you can trade with him for one. If that fails... there's still Gao or Xiukui. With your skills in alchemy, fellow Daoist, obtaining one shouldn't be too difficult."

Li Ximing now had a plan. Honestly, if he were a bit shameless, he could just stall, since Si Yuanli was still in seclusion. Once the Spiritual Artifact was in his hands, saying he was "waiting to trade with the Si Family" was a perfectly plausible excuse.

'But... my reputation precedes me. Since I'm taking their item, it's best to do my utmost to get the pill for the Southern Songzhou Luoshe. Making friends is always better than making enemies.'

"Thank you, fairy!"

He bowed in farewell and headed for the lake. He passed through multiple layers of formations, activated a hidden mechanism, and retrieved a small, silver-white casket from within the array before returning to Lake Xian.

Jiao Zhongzi was waiting patiently at Lake Xian. Seeing Li Ximing arrive on his beam of light, he asked with anticipation:

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing?"

Li Ximing flipped open the silver-white casket, revealing an inch of bright, flowing light within. He had sealed it with his Divine Ability to prevent it from transforming. He asked with equal anticipation:

"Fellow Daoist, please take a look?"

Jiao Zhongzi paused for a breath and then smiled.

"It is indeed the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury! And in excellent condition! Thank you, fellow Daoist!"

At this point, Jiao Zhongzi finally relaxed, looking much more at ease. He sighed.

"My Southern Songzhou Luoshe has been lacking this one Whole Pill... We searched so hard for it. To make matters worse, Daoist Master Qiushui's Divine Ability has been growing more perfect, so the Golden Feather Sect has been buying up most of the Whole Pill Purple Mansion Realm spiritual items from the last few decades at high prices... We couldn't find one anywhere! It's only because Hengzhu is on bad terms with the Golden Feather Sect and wouldn't do business, and because he also preserved it for your noble clan instead of using it, that this one portion remained..."

Li Ximing had already figured it out. The other spirit pill and the help refining the spirit embryo were just side items. They had been coveting the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury for a long time. Otherwise, why would they hand over the Spiritual Artifact first? They just knew the values weren't equal, feared he would raise the price, and were in a hurry to trade for the spiritual item. He couldn't help but laugh.

"It is merely a change of fate. It is your opportunity, as well as my own."

"Well said!"

Jiao Zhongzi clapped his hands and sighed. He fumbled in his sleeve for a moment and took out a short knife with an ivory blade and a jade hilt. He smiled.

"This is the 'Gleaming Edge'. It's an ancient dharma artifact I acquired by chance. Its quality is excellent. I'll give it to you, fellow Daoist. When you have news, just send a jade slip to the Southern Songzhou Luoshe."

Li Ximing accepted it solemnly. Only then did the other man retrieve a jade box from his sleeve. He opened it with his Divine Ability, revealing the Radiant Sun King's Halberd inside. A deep, golden-yellow light shot out. Li Ximing received it with both hands, feeling the weight settle in his palms. His eyes burned with desire. The bone-deep exhaustion from rushing around had finally dissipated.

"This truly wasn't easy!"

This was a heartfelt sigh. Li Ximing's obsession with Spiritual Artifacts ran deep. Whether fighting Yehui or Changxiao, he had been suppressed by his opponent's Spiritual Artifact and suffered greatly. Later, when he held the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, he was practically unwilling to let it go.

Since then, Li Ximing's obsession with Spiritual Artifacts had only grown. He had traveled all over the Southern Sea, rushing from place to place, even giving away his most treasured spiritual item. Now, holding the heavy Radiant Sun King's Halberd in his hands, he felt a sense of peace. Though it was only the length of his forearm, its heavy, iridescent gold mixed with a faint, silvery, sandy light was deeply reassuring.

As Jiao Zhongzi released his spiritual sense and erased his imprint, ownership of the Spiritual Artifact transferred. A potent Bright Yang Divine Ability surged up the long, round haft, instantly dyeing the qilin-scale patterns gold. Hidden runes beneath ignited one by one. The Spiritual Artifact seemed to come alive, shining with brilliant rays of light.

After several hundred years, this Radiant Sun King's Halberd was finally being infused with a Bright Yang Divine Ability. It began to tremble with spirituality, emitting clear, metallic chimes.

*Clang, clang, clang...*

*BOOM!*

The Profound Light flared. Li Ximing slightly relaxed his grip, and the Radiant Sun King's Halberd immediately shot up, assuming the posture of High Radiance. It hovered silently before him. An oppressive weight instantly filled the air, causing the Great Void to grow murky and the spiritual qi to fluctuate.

The Spiritual Artifact, now suffused with the Audience with the Celestial Gate Divine Ability, released an immense pressure, causing Jiao Zhongzi, who stood before him, to stagger. Faintly, the sound of cicadas could be heard within the Great Void.

Li Ximing couldn't help but close his eyes, communing with the Spiritual Artifact.

The Eastern Yue Purple Mansion Realm cultivator took a step back, watching calmly. He waited until Li Ximing exhaled a pale purple flame. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd then fell from the sky like a shooting star and was absorbed into the Profound Light at his glabella.

A faint golden, halberd-shaped sigil flashed and vanished behind Li Ximing's back. Stimulated by his Divine Ability, two sparks of fire lit up on Jiao Zhongzi's glabella before being quickly suppressed. He was clearly seeing the Spiritual Artifact display such profound power for the first time. He let out a deep breath and sighed.

"Congratulations, Zhaojing. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd has finally found its proper use."

Li Ximing felt the overwhelming urge to stop and test his new Spiritual Artifact. He was in an excellent mood, and even the Eastern Yue man before him looked agreeable. He smiled.

"Thank you, fellow Daoist!"

The flame on Jiao Zhongzi's glabella had only flashed for an instant, but Li Ximing was extremely sensitive to fire. He immediately sensed that the flame was extraordinary and offered praise:

"I didn't realize you were also a master of fire, fellow Daoist."

"Oh?"

Jiao Zhongzi raised an eyebrow and smiled. Layers of reddish-brown flames surged from beneath his feet, climbing up his robes. The young man grinned.

"I have heard of your Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, fellow Daoist. This humble one wields the Lesser Yang's 'Shaoshang Minister Fire'. If we have the chance in the future, we should certainly spar!"

He cupped his hands in salute, then erupted into flames and soared south, leaving a faint streak of light behind.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, the future is long. We will have many opportunities to meet again."
