# Chapter 691: News From Both Sides

Having reached this point in their discussion, they took the opportunity to mock Yuanwu for a bit before losing interest in further conversation. Daoist Master Pu Yu cupped his hands in farewell, glanced at Li Xuanfeng with a smile, and remarked, “This one has a resolute heart and the potential to traverse the mortal world unhindered. His future is bright. My friend, why not break through the Golden Tang Gate and retrieve the Heavenly Lustrous Gold Sutra?”

The mist on Yuan Su’s face wavered slightly, revealing a faintly ruthless expression beneath. He simply replied, “That little brat of Situ is still alive. I fear it’s a trap.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Daoist Master Pu Yu had already vanished. Only then did Yuan Su finally dispel the mist from his face.

Daoist Master Pu Yu could manipulate Yin and Yang and perceive life and death. Moreover, he was an overseas cultivator. If Yuan Su did not conceal himself, he feared he might end up ensnared in another scheme, just as Yuanwu had before him. Thus, he had no choice but to keep his face hidden.

Now that Pu Yu was gone, Yuan Su finally relaxed and turned to Li Xuanfeng, asking, “What do you think?”

Li Xuanfeng replied, “I have fulfilled ninety percent of the Daoist Master's command. The remaining targets are either hiding in the mountains or refusing to leave their islands. I lack the ability to pinpoint them.”

Yuan Su waved his hand indifferently, lifting a large bundle of storage pouches from the ground. As expected, they were all unopened. He tapped them twice on the table.

Soon, footsteps echoed from the entrance of the cave. Ning Heyuan rushed in and Yuan Su picked up the bundle of storage pouches, casually tossing it into his arms as he said, “Take these to Chi Zhiyun. You should know what to say.”

Ning Heyuan bowed deeply and quickly retreated. The mist swirled in the cave, leaving only Yuan Su and Li Xuanfeng.

Yuan Su leaned back against the jade throne, a trace of fatigue showing on his face and said softly, “Do not wander outside in the coming days. Yuanwu is going to cause a stir before his end. Once his life ends, you will accompany me to the Northern Sea for the ceremony.”

Li Xuanfeng acknowledged the command and slowly backed away. Only when he had reached the cave entrance did he lift his head. For a fleeting moment, the mist-shrouded jade platform no longer seemed to hold Yuan Su, but instead, a vast pool of crystal-clear water.

A melancholic flute melody drifted past his ears, ethereal and mournful. Only after stepping out of the cave did Li Xuanfeng finally regain his composure, sighing inwardly, “Yuan Su does not have much time left.”

Green Pine Island.

Green Pine Island was not particularly large, but in recent years, it had been nourished by spiritual energy. The geomantic lines had grown stronger, causing the entire mountain to rise several times in height. Even the underwater mountain range gradually surfaced. Apart from the territories that had already been divided among various sects, some overseas forces of the Foundation Establishment Realm had begun establishing outposts there.

Yet ten years passed in the blink of an eye and the spiritual energy of Green Pine Island dwindled year by year. After all, it was never truly a blessed land, merely a former resting place of an ancient grotto heaven. Now, it was gradually returning to its original state.

As one of the most renowned forces in the mainland, the Azure Pond Sect occupied an entire peak of its own. The mountain was covered in green pines and the northern winds howled relentlessly.

Li Xizhi sat quietly in the mountains, while beside a jade table stood Li Yuexiang. She wore a flowing robe, gripping her sword as faint sparks of flame flickered around her. Blessed by the island’s spiritual energy, she had progressed swiftly over the years and had now broken through to the fifth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Xizhi, as composed as ever, had reached the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm. His spells had become even more refined. As he meditated quietly on his spells, shimmering rainbow lights appeared around him and radiated an aura of mystery.

After a brief wait, someone approached and reported, “Daoist, Han Shizhen has come to visit.”

“Let him up,” said Li Xizhi.

Hearing that Han Shizhen had arrived, Li Yuexiang quickly found an excuse to leave. Li Xizhi put away his jade slip and saw a middle-aged man step forward, wearing a broad smile as he greeted, “Greetings, Daoist!”

This man was the head of the Han Family from Dongliu. His cultivation was decent and as a heir in his younger years, he had personally visited the Li Family and established ties with them. Through this connection, he had partnered with the Li Family in the trade of Wanglin Blossom.

The Han Family was relatively close to this place. Han Shizhen had a sociable nature, willing to be both generous and humble when needed. This allowed him to establish connections easily. When he heard that the Li Family had stationed a Daoist Master here, he immediately became interested. Over the years, he visited over a dozen times, bearing gifts and making efforts to build rapport. Until finally, he was granted an audience on the mountain.

Since they already had some prior ties, Li Xizhi let him be. After years of persistence, Han Shizhen had indeed managed to build a closer relationship.

Han Shizhen, with an eager smile, exchanged some pleasantries before getting to the point. He said, “I have come with important news for the Daoist.”

Seeing Li Xizhi turn his gaze towards him, he put on a solemn expression and said in a serious tone, “Daoist, I have uncovered some clues. Yuan Chengdun may already be dead!”

“What?”

Li Xizhi merely frowned, but then Han Shizhen hurriedly pulled a piece of bluish stone from his sleeve and handed it over, speaking in a grave tone, “A few days ago, a group of rogue cultivators from the Qunyi Strait brought back a number of spirit item and sold them in our family’s market. My men kept reporting that these spirit items were unlike anything they had seen before.

“I went to inspect them myself and consulted several ancient texts. That’s when I identified this as Demon Suppressing Stone, a material long extinct overseas but still found in the mainland. When I pressed the rogue cultivators for details, they claimed that these stones suddenly appeared in midair and dropped into the sea.

“I had heard that Yuan Chengdun practiced Sprawling Azure Mountain, a cultivation method that, upon death, transforms the body into this very type of spirit item. Suspicious, I investigated further and found a considerable amount of these stones at the seabed.”

Li Xizhi, well-versed in such matters, immediately understood what he was implying. He murmured, “You mean… he perished inside a secret realm, transformed into spirit items as his body returned to nature, then the items were all expelled from the realm and landed in the sea?”

“Daoist, your insight is sharp!” Han Shizhen immediately flattered him. Li Xizhi had received much favor from his master and was particularly concerned about Yuan Tuan. Over the years, he had searched all over the Eastern Sea for clues. Knowing this, Han Shizhen did not hesitate to report any findings to him.

Now that he had finally obtained a clue regarding Yuan Tuan, Li Xizhi’s heart stirred, and he asked, “Did you find the two Demon Subduing Copper Rods?”

Han Shizhen shook his head. Li Xizhi pondered for a brief moment before deducing and said, “If Yuan Chengdun truly perished in this event, then the Demon Subduing Copper Rods must have already been taken. Those rogue cultivators likely have them. But such treasures are far too valuable, they must be hiding them carefully and would never admit it to you.”

Han Shizhen was briefly stunned but quickly realized the truth. He said regretfully, “I was careless! Once I had my suspicions, I rushed to inform you and didn’t dare delay. I should have captured them immediately.”

Li Xizhi, long aware that Eastern Sea cultivators operated with little regard for morality, was unsurprised. He said in a low voice, “I will accompany you to that market. While we’re there, I will take a look at exactly where in the Qunyi Strait this occurred.”
