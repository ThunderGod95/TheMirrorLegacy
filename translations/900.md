# Chapter 900: Strategic Calculations

The Daoist tradition of the Northern Sea had refused to lend their artifact, so Li Ximing saw no point in courting rejection by pressing the issue. He didn't even ask where Kui Qi was. Instead, he mentioned Dingyang Zi, and the group proceeded up the mountain.

"That Dingyang Zi, whom Senior Kui Qi invited, already came to the lake. We've concluded our discussions. He sent over a pill recipe, the 'Serpentwater Suspension Powder,' and asked me to refine it."

The main hall on Tangdao Mountain had long since been repaired. Tinglan, who looked to be fully recovered from her injuries, led the group inside. As she listened to Li Ximing speak of Dingyang Zi, Houfu shook his head.

"He's... lacking in tact. If he caused any offense, please forgive him, Zhaojing."

Li Ximing understood the situation. He noticed Tinglan anxiously watching his expression, as if worried he and Dingyang Zi had clashed.

Tinglan quickly explained, "That man may have ties to the Supreme Yang, but he hasn't got an easy temperament. He's been disappointed in Changhuai for a long time, which makes him abrasive. But the moment Senior Kui Qi sent a letter, he agreed immediately. It shows his heart is still on our side. Please just overlook his gruffness."

They spoke as if it were a serious issue, but based on Li Ximing's own interaction with Dingyang Zi, the man had his diplomatic moments. He hadn't been particularly rude or foul-mouthed.

"Dingyang Zi is a straightforward man," Li Ximing said. "He's capable and decisiveâ€”a whirlwind of activity. He sorted out the entire matter in no time."

Upon entering the great hall, they saw a jade table set at the head, with seats arrayed on either side. There was no music, dancing, or fine wine; it was a simple, functional hall. The man seated at the head regarded them with a relatively relaxed expression and nodded a greeting.

"Senior Kui Qi!"

Kan Ziyu's breakthrough was clearly a potent balm; even Kui Qi's complexion looked significantly better. After everyone was seated, Kui Qi took the initiative to offer his congratulations.

"Congratulations, Daoist Friend."

Tinglan smiled and returned the courtesy. Li Ximing watched her, then turned to Kui Qi who said calmly, "I went to the Northern Sea as planned. The array disc for the Xie Clan's 'Magnetic-Control Swarm-Light Array' was borrowed by the Touba Clan thirty years ago. It is... unobtainable."

A hush fell over the hall. The Touba Clan wasn't exactly intimate with the Buddhist cultivators, but being neighbors in the north, they had frequent dealings. The Supreme Yang Dao, on the other hand, had no relationship with the Touba Clan to speak of. There was naturally no chance they would agree to lend the array.

Kui Qi paused for a moment, absorbing the news, before continuing, "After I returned from the Northern Sea, I immediately detoured to the Peacock Sea. This time, it was a formal, official visit, so it was handled with more ceremony. At least I've returned to hear this excellent news about Ziyu."

Li Ximing had been to the Peacock Sea himself, so he knew Kui Qi was referring to the Great Daoist Master Yuandao of the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition, who maintained close ties with the Supreme Yang Dao. Just then, Tinglan began her report.

"These past days, numerous Merciful Ones and Master Monks have arrived outside the mountain. We haven't spotted any Mahas, but there's no shortage of small-timers, and plenty who come forward to provoke us."

"The disciples at the Foundation Establishment Realm have been skirmishing daily. Casualties are unavoidable, but thankfully, they remain within acceptable limits. None of the main clans have suffered major losses among their core disciples. The enemy's Merciful Ones have made three moves, always in groups of three or four, striking at our formation. They retreat after a single probe. It's clear they're testing our defenses and gauging our numbers."

"However, based on the 'golden bodies' we've sighted, we can confirm that Taixi and Nuzi, at the very least, have been driven here like hounds. We haven't seen signs of other Daoist traditions, but we *have* detected traces of the 'Belly Buddhist Land'. I fear it's the Way of Compassion."

The Way of Compassion was the hegemon of the Yan State and the most active branch of the Northern Buddhists. Their presence here was decidedly bad news, causing Li Ximing to frown. The others, however, showed no surprise, as if this was entirely expected.

'The Way of Compassion also led the charge in the last great conflict between North and South...'

Tinglan's expression turned serious as she looked at Li Ximing. "There's no sense in just waiting for them to break down our doors. Now that Zhaojing is out of seclusion and Senior Kui Qi has returned, it's time we led a contingent of our own to test their mettle."

The two-year deadline was fast approaching. By unspoken agreement, no one mentioned the sword immortal, Daoist Master Lou Xing.

Though time ticked by, the sword immortal's deterrent presence had not fully faded. But once Daoist Master Lou Xing ascended Luoxia and passed away, the North would learn of it instantly. The moment that happened, the deterrence would vanish. It was crucial, therefore, to probe the enemy's strength before that time came.

Purple Smoke had gained Kan Ziyu, which was another trump card, but the northern Buddhist cultivators were not blind. In fact, their skills in divination surpassed most immortal cultivators. They would surely know of it by now. It was even possible that the moment conflict erupted, the North would strike pre-emptively, before Tangdao Mountain could even mobilize.

'Honestly, it would be best if Daoist Master Lou Xing could just cling to a thread of life, playing the part of a walking corpse, to keep the news of his death from leaking,' Li Ximing thought. 'But the old man's life has run its course. His dying wish was fulfilled; slaying that Maha was his final contribution. How could they ask him to endure more just for the sake of Xiukui...'

Kui Qi's expression grew somber. "We have long been preparing for this..."

He had only spoken half a sentence when a figure in white robes passed through the formation and entered the hall. The man wore the robes of a Daoist and carried a sword on his back. He was exceptionally handsome, and his aura was immense. It was none other than the Jade True sword cultivator from the Southern Borderlands, Daoist Master Zhusheng!

He arrived before them, offered a salute, and smiled. "Greetings, fellow Daoists!"

Li Ximing returned the salute and nodded silently, a sudden realization dawning on him.

'So that's what this is about. The Supreme Yang Dao contingent already had this planned, just waiting for the right moment to strike. But Kui Qi is a proud man; he would never accept help for free. He must have moved up the timeline for the spirit embryo matter, specifically inviting Dingyang Zi, forcing the man to drop the Spiritual Artifacts he was refining, and making him agree to my request as a condition.'

'The original plan was likely to wait another three to five days. Ning Wan would have returned from the south, all the reinforcements would have gathered, and then they would have formally summoned me to the mountain. But Kan Ziyu's sudden breakthrough changed things. Everyone was already gathered, so they just invited me over on the spot. That must be why Ning Wan isn't here.'

A chill ran through him. 'They even brought in Daoist Master Zhusheng from the distant Southern Borderlands? If they were willing to swallow their pride, couldn't they also have called upon the much-closer Chunyi Dao Gate? Chen Yin of the Yuyang Chen Clan would be even easier to summon. Southern Songzhou Luoshe is less certain... but if Ning Wan put her Daoist tradition's interests aside for a moment, would Daoist Master Luo really refuse to come?'

'Kui Qi is a man of daring. Having committed to holding Tangdao Mountain, he's bringing his full strength to bear. He has no intention of sheathing his sword until he has made the Buddhist cultivators *feel* this loss!'

Just then, the Jade True cultivator, Daoist Master Zhusheng, asked, "I wonder, where is Daoist Master Zhu Gong at present?"

At this, Tinglan answered with a trace of embarrassment, "It's hard to say. I've inquired several times but found no trace of her. I fear she may have already entered seclusion."

This wasn't particularly surprising. Li Ximing mused inwardly that it was highly unlikely Daoist Master Zhu Gong was unaware of the situation in Jiangnan. She was probably using this crisis as an opportunity to extricate herself. After all, her sect was located near Purple Smoke, and with the Capital immortals Dao on the front lines, the smartest move was to harden her heart and stay away.

'Even if she were here, they probably wouldn't announce it,' he thought. 'If the Chunyi Dao Gate was present, Zhu Gong's Eastern Sea origins would be an indelible stain. It would be one thing if she were at full strength, but injured? She wouldn't dare make her presence known...'

Li Ximing now understood Ning Wan's purpose for her trip to the Southern Sea. He watched as Kui Qi rose to his feet, hands clasped behind his back.

"Tangdao Mountain itself is a barrier. To the north lies the Luoxia Plain, backed by the fertile lands of Baijiang Creek. It is the strategic key to the north and south. It connects to Xiaoshi in the west and Chengyun in the east. We hold the terrain advantage, reinforced by our great formation, giving us the high ground. The Buddhist cultivators' forces are scattered across the north and difficult to concentrate. The mountain's geography alone, facing north and split into three main ridges, will be a formidable obstacle for them."

"For now, the Lotus Temple is not intervening. The Buddhist cultivators' nearest major sect is at Qinling Mountain, which is a great distance away. Therefore, they have established forward temples in three areas: the Xiaoshi region, the Luoxia region, and the Caishan region, corresponding to our west, north, and east flanks."

Kui Qi stated gravely, "All three locations must be pinned down. The Caishan area borders Chengyun; I would like Zhaojing to handle that front. Xiaoshi Mountain will be Tinglan's responsibility. The rest of us will punch directly through the north and draw first blood."

Kui Qi's plan was straightforward. At the Purple Mansion Realm, distance is a trivial obstacle. Unless pinned down by another expert of the same level, traversing the Great Void to any of those locations would take almost no time at all.

Li Ximing, with his Audience with the Celestial Gate, and Tinglan, wielding the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion, were the perfect candidates for this task. One would hold the west, the other the east, pinning down the Buddhist cultivators' forces. This would allow Kui Qi and the main assault team to strike deep and destroy the Northern Buddhists' staging ground.

Li Ximing mulled it over and agreed. "If you have orders, Daoist Friend, just summon me with a jade talisman. I acquired some artifact from the Buddhist cultivators some time ago. This might be a good opportunity to visit Chengyun."

Kui Qi laughed. "Of course! I was just about to mention it. You should coordinate with Chengyun. Given Caishan's location, if the situation turns sour, we'll need to rely on them to provide you with support."

"As for that 'Radiant Glaze Kasaya' you have, it's an extraordinary artifact. The Lotus Temple has already inquired about it; they even sent people to me. Their agents are also in the Chengyun Gate area. You can certainly exchange it for something valuable."

Li Ximing recalled how Nu Yan had used that kasaya to capture Bai Yinzi. It had emerged from that great battle completely unscathed. He had known then that it was a remarkable treasure and had been planning to trade it eventually. He just hadn't expected the Lotus Temple to seek him out first.

Li Ximing was already overdue for a trip to Chengyun Gate, both to deal with the matter concerning Wang Quwan and Wang Xiaoxiao and to trade the kasaya. He smiled and bid farewell to the others, preparing to depart on his ray of light, but Kui Qi stopped him. "A moment," he said softly.

"In five days, the Purple Smoke Gate will be celebrating Daoist Master Wenqing's breakthrough to the divine ability stage. They are hosting a grand banquet in the Purple Smoke Blessed Land and have invited cultivators from all across Jiangnan. All the Daoist Masters will be there. We would ask Zhaojing to please leave behind a wisp of your divine ability for us to... borrow."

'No wonder Zhusheng arrived first!' Li Ximing realized.

Li Ximing was stunned for only a fraction of a second before he understood. He smiled. "Excellent!"

He brought two fingers together, and a brilliant mote of Heavenly Light sparked at their tip. Kui Qi carefully gathered it into his sleeve and bowed. "A mere divine ability transformation, an ensouled wax figure sitting in the clouds. My apologies for the deception!"

A core Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Monastery and Zhusheng of the Jade True path, combining their skills to create an illusion... forget a monk trying to divine it from thousands of miles away; even if they saw it face-to-face, they'd be fooled and turn tail.

"Not at all!"

Li Ximing departed in a ray of light. Zhusheng simply bowed to Kui Qi and said, "I dislike this Primordial Magnetism. I will wait outside the mountain."

And so, only the three core members of the Supreme Yang Dao remained in the hall. Kui Qi let out a long breath, rubbing the space between his eyebrows. "What news from Xuanmiao Temple?"

Tinglan replied, "Sumian is dead set on not getting involved. The word from his sect is that he took the ancestral portrait from the main hall, traversed the void, and left without saying another word."

Houfu made a quick calculation with his fingers. "It should still be enough," he said reassuringly. "We don't need him."

"We have no choice now but to force a decisive battle in the north!"

Kui Qi's brow furrowed deeply. "The Northern Buddhists and our Immortal Dao are not the same. Their advancement is based on vacant positions. If there are none, they just wait. They don't require the same constant, daily cultivation we do. They can afford a war of attrition, harassing us every few days. Can we?"

"We have divine abilities to master, spell arts to cultivate, spirit pills to nurture, and Spiritual Artifacts to refine! Not to mention guiding our juniors. We don't have this kind of time! If we let them drag us into endless skirmishes in this mountain range, when will we ever advance our own cultivation?"

"Furthermore, the North can attack at will, but we can't guarantee we can assemble this many allies every time. Today one person is in seclusion, tomorrow another is in the middle of a critical refinement and cannot be disturbed. Our numbers will depend on luck, and every time we call, we incur more debts!"

"Ziyu's breakthrough is the perfect cover. The Way of Compassion excels at divination; they will certainly try to scry the situation. But everyone has left a trace of their aura and a transformation art behind in the Blessed Land, all mixed together. Unless Pu Yu or Qiushui comes personally, they won't be able to get a clear reading. It's more than enough to confuse them."

He closed his eyes and let out a heavy sigh. "If we are to fight, it must be one, decisive, vicious battle. Once our allies scatter and return to their own affairs, we will be left to defend this mountain alone..."

At this, Kui Qi flicked his sleeves and stood up. Houfu added, "We can only face what comes. The worst-case scenario is that we lose Jiangbei."

...

Li Ximing traveled as a ray of light, traversing the Great Void for a time before he spotted the so-called Caishan. It was a low, squat hill, yet it was covered so densely with temples that they looked poised to crush the mountain flat beneath their weight. A dazzling Treasure Light radiated from them.

Several iridescent beams of light descended faintly from the sky, likely a few Merciful Ones channeling the power of the Buddhist Land as part of their cultivation. Li Ximing gave it a cursory glance; there were at least three of them. As for whether a Maha was present, that was impossible to tell.

'Five days will pass in the blink of an eye. I'd best use the time to trade for some intelligence. It could give us the upper hand in the chaos to come.'

Li Ximing wasn't worried about the Lotus Temple refusing to talk. The Buddhist cultivators were, after all, a deeply fractured group. The faction led by the Great Adoration Dharma Realm was particularly radical, with some members openly calling the Way of Compassion fiends. The Lotus Temple might not be virtuous, but an opportunity to gain something valuable *while simultaneously* undermining the Way of Compassion? That was a godsend they wouldn't dare pass up.

Sure enough, as Li Ximing made a show of visiting Chengyun, deliberately avoiding Caishan, he hadn't even descended to Chengshui Marsh when he saw a monk streak across the sky on a ray of golden light. The monk spotted him, his expression a mixture of shock and delight. "Daoist Friend! Daoist Friend!"

Li Ximing glanced over. The monk wore a white kasaya embroidered with pink and gold lotus flowers. With his rosy lips and white teeth, he looked more like a handsome youth. It was none other than Merciful One Minghui, whom he had met in Chengyun's territory years ago.

With the constant friction between north and south, the Lotus Temple's neutrality was a boon. Li Ximing offered him no special courtesy, merely giving a flat, formal salute. "Merciful One. A fine robe."

"Not at all, not at all!" The monk beamed, looking overjoyed. "I've been lingering in the area for some time. I wanted to head south, but I feared... causing offense. Haha, the robe in *your* hands, Daoist Friend, now *that* is a fine kasaya!"

The Lotus Temple was, after all, one of the seven great powers of the Northern Buddhists. Li Ximing cut straight to the point. "The 'Radiant Glaze Kasaya' is indeed in my possession. I hear the Lotus Temple has a need for it?"

"Indeed! Indeed!" Minghui gestured for him to follow. The two descended discreetly. Li Ximing retracted his aura, and the monk, with a simple shimmer, transformed into a black-haired, long-bearded Daoist. They walked together across the Chengshui Marsh as the monk chuckled.

"It truly must be fate. I've had my eye on that 'Radiant Glaze Kasaya' for some time, but then it was taken by Nu Yan to hunt someone down. To think it would fall into your hands, Daoist Friend, without even having a chance to display its power..."

Li Ximing watched this casual, seemingly effortless transformation. There was a profound subtlety to it, and he felt a quiet sense of apprehension.

'I've fought my share of Merciful Ones. Most only know one or two Dharma Arts, and none with this level of fluid mastery. He's also skilled in divination, as I recall... This Minghui must be a top-tier figure in the Way of Joyful Bliss, perhaps even a Merciful One personally taught by Jinlian.'

He kept his expression neutral. "Then it all depends on whether you can afford the price, Daoist Friend."

At this, Minghui waved his hands dismissively and gestured forward, yet he seemed hesitant. He kept glancing toward the distant gates of Chengyun, clearly implying something.

After all, their two factions had no friendly relations, nor any real foundation of trust. Without a neutral Daoist Master to mediate, reaching an agreement would be difficult. Li Ximing understood.

"This isn't the place to discuss such matters in broad daylight. Please, Daoist Friend, accompany me to the Chengyun Gate. We can both meet with Daoist Master Changyun, and everything can be discussed properly."

"Yes, yes, precisely."

Minghui quickly fell in step with him. They proceeded toward the Chengyun Gate, soon arriving at its mountain, Mount Yebai. There in the marsh, they were met by a Chengyun disciple.

The disciple possessed a clear, refined aura. With a resolute face, a sword at his waist, and a dignified bearing, he was the very model of an orthodox sect disciple. He recognized Minghui at a glance, bowed deeply, and said, "My lords, please wait in the pavilion. This disciple will immediately inform my Daoist Master!"
