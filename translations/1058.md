# Chapter 1058: One After Another

The glaring silver light was blinding, and Li Ximing's heart turned ice-cold.

In his eyes, although the Li family had many capable individuals, the matter of succession was troubling. Li Zhouwei was consumed by his pursuit of the Dao, and the scions of the Bright Yang line all had their own plans. If the situation collapsed, Li Ximing knew full well he couldn't rely on them. The fate of the Bright Yang bloodline would be precarious at best.

Li Que'wan and Li Jiangqian both had the potential for the Purple Mansion Realm. He viewed Li Que'wan, in particular, as the Li family's escape route to the Eastern Sea should the Bright Yang Dao fail. Li Jiangchun was a "Purple Mansion seed" and also possessed the Yang family bloodline, making him a perfect successor to follow—another hidden card.

But when considering the younger generations after them, Li Ximing was struck by a strong sense of foreboding.

It was simple: if the Bright Yang scions couldn't be preserved, the following generations would be mediocre. Li Jiangchun's sword heart was renowned, and the family was counting on him to break through to Sword Intent. They had no intention of letting him be distracted, meaning it was ninety-nine percent certain he would have no heirs. Also at the Foundation Establishment Realm, it was better to count on Li Zhouluo than him. Li Que'wan was singularly focused on the Dao and already preparing for the Purple Mansion Realm, making her even more unlikely to have heirs. The second and fourth branches had no outstanding descendants, the third branch had already split off, leaving only the first branch to prosper.

Li Zhouming had been the best choice. But Li Ximing had privately discussed it with Li Xuanxuan; Li Zhouming, after all, cultivated Bright Yang... The old man mulled it over. A Bright Yang cultivator should not be put in charge again.

Li Suining's arrival was timely. He was from the generation just below, highly talented, and showed great promise in the Formation Dao. Most importantly, he had a stable, intelligent, and calm personality. Li Ximing had liked him from their first meeting and hoped to see his bloodline continue... all for the sake of future considerations.

But with Li Jianglong's example right there, and now this flash of silver light before his eyes, Li Ximing subconsciously felt this was the work of some mighty expert. The candidate being groomed to shoulder the family's burdens might just be a mole for another power. How could Li Ximing not be horrified!

In that instant, he forced his gaze to remain on the furnace. His face remained calm, but his heart had turned to a pool of ice. He activated the scouting ability of the Immortal Artifact, locking it firmly onto Li Suining.

He saw the silver light on the young man's body fluctuating erratically, like breathing. Li Ximing focused his vision and saw the silver light gradually fade, revealing a somewhat familiar aura.

'It seems to be... the aura of the Fox Clan's 'Heaven–Governing' Dao... And it also resembles the wondrous fluctuations from when Wanling Heaven first opened.'

Although Li Suining also cultivated 'Heaven–Governing', his mere Qi Refining cultivation couldn't possibly shine so dazzlingly under the Immortal Artifact's scrutiny. Li Ximing made his judgment quickly, growing suspicious. He mused:

'Could this be an arrangement by the Fox Clan...'

This slightly lessened the chill in his heart.

After all, his family had a considerable relationship with the Fox Clan. Back when the Great Daoist Master from Luoxia had come to the lake, a Fox Clan Demon King had even appeared to confront him... In a sense, they still had common interests.

'But while this silver light seems noble, it doesn't look like it has any substantial power. Instead, it seems more like the Immortal Mirror detected some special characteristic... Besides, if this really were a reincarnation, it wouldn't have just happened today or yesterday...'

He closed his eyes slightly, pondering for a long time before reaching a preliminary conclusion,

'Back then, the Yang family most likely didn't understand the situation at the lake. The Martial Cultivation Star, someone as lofty as a True Monarch, also met their end at the lake. Whatever the reason, the lake holds many secrets... Rather than a mole, could it be... reincarnation? Or some kind of fortunate encounter?'

Li Suining hadn't left many flaws in his story. In fact, his behavior couldn't even be called flawed. But viewed from a different perspective, once a trace of suspicion had formed, many things looked completely different:

'It all makes sense now. It must be because he's the reincarnation of a powerful cultivator that he's so calm and composed at such a young age. And it explains how he inexplicably obtained such high Dao-Profundity in formations... that's not something "talent" alone can cover.'

'But his concern for the clan doesn't seem fake... Could it be that he hasn't fully awakened his past-life memories?'

Li Ximing sank into deep thought. Although he didn't think Li Suining himself possessed any great strength, he had secretly raised his vigilance to the maximum. Not wanting to startle his potential "prey," he simply waved his hand and instructed:

"Go back to Jiangjuan for now. We wouldn't want anyone accusing you of abandoning your post."

Li Jianglong said no more, immediately bowing and taking his leave. Only Li Suining remained standing on the mountain. Li Ximing didn't speak for a moment. Just then, Li Minggong came up the path and handed him two letters.

"Daoist Master... A letter from the Wave-Suppressing Mansion."

Li Ximing had to temporarily suppress his feelings and take out the letter. He read it. Liu Changdie had written a hundred grand-sounding words explaining the situation, his tone filled with pleading. Li Ximing's expression tightened.

'Something's happened to Qingyan, and Fuxun is gravely injured...'

A dark premonition surfaced in his mind. He set that letter down and picked up the one from Li Que'wan. Reading it from beginning to end, he noticed she had addressed him as "Lord."

'Trouble on the island...'

Li Ximing's sense of foreboding intensified. Li Que'wan always addressed him as Daoist Master. Before she left, he had made an agreement with her: if something strange happened on the island that they didn't dare write about openly, they were to change "Daoist Master" to "Lord." He certainly didn't believe Li Que'wan had made a simple mistake.

'Good, she only changed it in one place, and the tone isn't urgent. It should be able to wait a little while.'

But his worry suddenly escalated, and a chill seeped into his heart. Li Ximing cursed inwardly,

'Everything is happening at once!'

If Li Suining represented the future pillar who would manage the family's affairs, then Li Que'wan was, without a doubt, a critical combat asset who absolutely could not be lost. This was a trip Li Ximing had to make.

Although Daoist Master Yan had agreed back then to help him after achieving 'World's Radiance', and he also had to make a trip to the Nine Mounds for Li Jiangchun... those things paled in comparison to this forced trip to the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. Li Ximing's mood soured instantly. He casually set the letters down, his expression remaining outwardly calm. Composing himself, he spoke with deliberation.

Li Suining had been waiting all this time. He finally heard the Daoist Master ask with a smile,

"Here to get your pills for a breakthrough?"

Li Suining was deferential, keeping his gaze lowered. He hadn't noticed anything unusual about the man. He nodded politely and replied,

"This junior's aura has reached completion, and I am preparing to break through... It's just that spiritual resources and Demon beasts for the 'Heaven–Governing' Dao are rare, and Essence Gathering Pills for this path are even rarer. The Old Master sent this junior to see you, Lord."

Li Ximing nodded slowly.

"The 'Heaven–Governing' Dao doesn't have many prohibitions... However... if you can find a quality pill, it not only provides a better guarantee but can also save you a year or two of delay..."

He smiled.

"I don't have those things on hand. But I happen to be going to the Eastern Sea soon. I'll ask for some from Daoist Master Yuanbian for you."

Li Suining seemed reluctant to have him go to such trouble. He bowed his thanks with some hesitation, wanting to say more but holding back. His heart felt bitter.

'If I'd known, I never would have brought this up! Although there hasn't been a war for a year or two... what if something happens to him out there...'

Li Ximing, however, was observing his expression. He gestured for him to come and sit, casually brewed a cup of tea, and smiled.

"Your... cultivation in the Formation Dao... how is it coming along?"

Li Suining merely bowed, found an appropriate level of detail, and began to speak concisely. Li Ximing listened in silence, secretly committing it all to memory, preparing to discuss it in detail with Liu Changdie later.

But watching the young man speak with such confidence and eloquence, Li Ximing's suspicion grew:

'But since he hasn't formed a divine ability and doesn't have a Talisman Seed... how could he possibly resist my Life Divine Ability? If I used my Life Divine Ability to control him, wouldn't he fall right into my hands?'

Moreover, he still had doubts, and he had to rush to the Eastern Sea. Naturally, he had to leave some safeguards in place before he left. He smiled and said,

"I am going to the Eastern Sea to fetch spiritual resources for you... but my pill furnace is still on the mountain. How about you read your Formation Dao Classics while keeping an eye on it for me?"

Li Suining had no intention of refusing. He nodded quickly, accepting the task with great seriousness. Li Ximing reached into his sleeve, using his divine ability to coalesce a magical fan. He placed it in the young man's hand and said solemnly,

"This means you'll have to act as my medicine boy. Just use your dharma power to wave this fan and watch the furnace fire for me until I return."

"Yes!"

Li Suining treated this as an extremely important mission and nodded gravely. The moment that "Yes" left his lips, a hidden radiance flashed in Li Ximing's eyes. His hand, concealed in his sleeve, performed a quick incantation seal, and the Light of the Six Harmonies leaped forth.

It was the 'World's Radiance'!

The call and response seemed like a mere formality, but this subordinate relationship was captured by the 'World's Radiance'. It triggered a mystical response, placing Li Suining under the watch of the Life Divine Ability!

If Li Suining felt even a trace of resentment or disloyalty, Li Ximing would sense it! The golden fan in his hand would immediately respond and blast him to smithereens.

The colorless Light of the Six Harmonies pulsed faintly at his fingertip. Li Ximing's heart relaxed slightly,

'The feedback from 'World's Radiance'... he genuinely respects me. It seems his feelings for the family are also real, without a hint of falsehood... It looks like... this child really did just receive some kind of fortunate encounter...'

If it was indeed the latter, and Li Suining had obtained some opportunity related to the Heaven–Governing Dao, Li Ximing was relieved, but he also had to consider if there was a problem with the opportunity itself. In any case, with the 'World's Radiance' in effect, Li Ximing could set his mind at ease for now.

'He seems like a good kid... I can't wrong him. This is the best way to handle it for now. When I return, I'll send him into seclusion and wait for Zhouwei to emerge. We can discuss it in detail then.'

With that, he strode off the mountain. He ordered Li Minggong to lock down the great formation of Gardenia Scenery Mountain, forbidding anyone from entering, and instructed,

"Go and invite Daoist Master Nanwu here. Ask him to hold the fort on the mountain for me... Something has come up in the Eastern Sea. I'll be back as soon as I can."

Only then did he hastily ride the winds, stepping into the Great Void.

---

The night was grim and dark.

The sky above Chengyun Gate was thick with dark clouds, devoid of any illusory color. A young man stood on a high platform, his face slightly pale as he gazed at the night sky. His long robes, patterned with white feathers and black mystic sigils, fluttered slightly in the air, adding to the oppressive atmosphere.

This was none other than the master of Chengyun Gate, Daoist Master Changyun.

He stood silently on the high platform. The surging gale only managed to stir a few strands of his hair, and his eyes held an extremely profound gaze.

Beside him, a young man in black robes also stood in the wind. He was a full head taller than Daoist Master Changyun. His long spear was planted on the ground, and his body pulsed with divine ability, giving him an imposing and powerful aura.

After an unknown amount of time, the spear-wielding young man lowered his gaze and advised,

"Lord, that person instructed that when cultivating this kind of secret art, it is best not to be seen..."

Changyun calmly shook his head. "Zhonggong... there will be no more chances after this."

This spear-wielding Daoist Master was, astonishingly, the Sect Master of Chengyun Gate, Zhong Qian!

He had not been in the Purple Mansion Realm for long, but his divine ability and aura were overwhelming. His features were sharp. When he had met Li Xuanfeng back then, his face still held a trace of childishness, but that was now completely gone, replaced by the dignity and calm belonging to the Purple Mansion Realm.

Changyun turned his head and said flatly,

"A great war is about to erupt in the south. They will certainly come to dispatch me. They're playing dumb, wanting us to suffer in silence, unable to voice our grievances."

His words were scathing, but his expression showed no sign of dejection. It was as if his own secret being exposed was no big deal.

After a while, a golden-white light soared over from the distance. A high-spirited Daoist landed, though he was riding a propitious cloud, which looked somewhat out of place.

"Brother Changyun!"

The monk shouted, landing on the platform. He wasn't surprised to find that Changyun already knew he was coming. He bowed, his expression a bit awkward, and said,

"I've received orders to invite you to head south and guard the riverbank."

Zhong Qian's expression flickered at these words, but Changyun smiled and invited the monk inside. He studied the monk's face, shook his head, and said:

"Daoist Friend Minghui... these past few years haven't been easy for you, have they!"

Minghui's awkward expression gradually faded. He let out a deep sigh and replied,

"Daoist Master, your eyes are as sharp as a torch. I've been living on this riverbank as if walking on thin ice. This business of ordering you south is an offensive task, so naturally, it fell into my hands..."

After the great war of the nation's founding, the Li family got a chance to rest and recuperate. But Minghui had truly suffered these past few years. He'd been transferred to Shanji, and every year, he was the one sent on probing missions! He had tasted the power of Tinglan's Immeasurable Water and Fire more than once!

Minghui complained for a while, then secretly glanced at Zhong Qian. Just one look, and he felt a surging brilliance from the man's body. He was stunned.

'Such a powerful destiny! If this man were to join the Buddhists, he would definitely achieve great things!'

While he was still secretly observing, Changyun was already sneering inwardly,

'Qi Lanyan... oh, Qi Lanyan. I've been in seclusion for so long, yet you just had to be the one to call me out! Fine, fine. A minor cultivator from the Qi family, with the support of Profound Governance, thinks he can call the wind and summon the rain. He's utterly, unbelievably stupid!'

'Are there so few great figures in the world who know about this? No! But every last one of them has learned to be clever and play dumb. Only this idiot lets himself be pushed to the forefront, thinking he's learned some secret and dares to scheme against my Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition...'

Just as Qi Lanyan had predicted years ago, the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition was certainly furious. But Changyun—or rather, Zhang Yun of the Golden Feather Sect—saw Qi Lanyan's boldness as mere ignorance:

'It is usually _my_ Dao that schemes against others and controls the world. Now it's his turn to scheme against me!'

His thoughts were dark. The monk, Minghui, could no longer hold back. His eyes filled with envy as he looked at Changyun and said,

"Daoist Master, you've already achieved three divine abilities! Such speed! Even those scions of immortals at the Golden Core level are no better than this!"

No matter how much flattery or politeness his words contained, they struck Changyun as sensitive. After all, he, Changyun, _was_ a hidden agent of the Golden Feather Sect. The words sounded like mockery. His eyes, which already seemed somewhat gloomy, swept over the monk:

'Does this monk know or not? His words are so sharp... Could it be that the Lotus Temple also knows? Given Jinlian's status... by common logic, he shouldn't have access to this information...'

Outwardly, he just said flatly, "Pure luck."

Minghui shook his head and sighed. "I heard the Yang family's Purple and Gold Palace has opened. Something is bound to happen on the river sooner or later. I came this time not only to do this offensive task, but also to ask you a question or two."

"Oh?"

Changyun raised an eyebrow. He listened to the monk's troubled agonizing. After a long pause, and seeing that the grand formation was sealed, Minghui finally whispered furtively,

"You and I have been friends for many years... Do you... do you know any good ways to get oneself killed? Could you... teach me...?"

At these words, Zhong Qian, who had been standing by looking serious and worried, couldn't help but twitch his lips. Changyun stared at the monk, dumbfounded, and replied in a strange tone,

"How bizarre. In this vast world, paths to survival are few. You're telling me paths to death are also hard to find?"
