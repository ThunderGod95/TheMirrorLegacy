# Chapter 723: Pearl Swallowing

Daoist Master Zipei asked a question and then paused slightly. The purple mist within the cave dwelling paused along with her words, and Li Xuanfeng could only reply, "I was originally a cultivator of the Li Family from Moongaze Lake. Thanks to your guidance, I was stationed at the southern border. Now, I serve under the Ning Family."

"Li of Moongaze?" muttered Zipei.

Daoist Master Zipei didn’t seem to care much, only listening as Daoist Master Pu Yu spoke softly, "Senior, I heard they're a branch of the Wei’s Li lineage under Azure Pond Sect's jurisdiction."

"So it's the Wei’s Li branch," said Zipei.

Upon hearing this, Daoist Master Zipei immediately lost interest, as if she didn’t think much of Wei's Li. But since Li Xuanfeng had ties to Yuan Su, she pondered for a moment and said, "Wei’s Li, there’ll be room for movement later. Find a place to rest on the peak for now. When the time comes, return with Si Boxiu."

Li Xuanfeng cupped his hands and took his leave, descending into the mountain as purple mist drifted through the celestial landscape. Daoist Master Pu Yu watched him go and said seriously, "Senior Yuan Su truly went to great lengths to protect his junior, leaving the bargaining chip with the Ning Family was quite the calculated move..."

"Mm." Daoist Master Zipei responded softly, clearly seeing through the arrangement as well, "If he had passed away within the sect, this Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal would likely have ended up in the hands of the Chi Family or Si Boxiu. Even if passed to his descendants, it wouldn’t escape the sect's hidden manipulations.

"By passing away in public view, he actually secured the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal. With the Golden Feather Sect, you, and I as guarantors, and Si Boxiu needing to save face, it can be safeguarded for at least a few decades."

Daoist Master Pu Yu shook his head and said, "It won’t last forever. Once Si Boxiu waits too long and grows impatient, he’ll find ways, through pressure or otherwise, to make him hand it over willingly."

Daoist Master Zipei sat down amidst the swirling purple mist within her cave and said with a nod, "Isn't there a Ning Wan? A few decades should be more than enough. If she succeeds in her breakthrough, she’ll rightfully keep the spirit artifact. If she fails, it's a danger in her hands anyway, handing it over wouldn’t be a loss."

Both Daoist Masters had clearly seen through Yuan Su’s arrangement. Even Si Boxiu understood it, but each chose to go along with the flow.

Daoist Master Pu Yu paused, seemingly deep in thought, and after a long while spoke softly, "The True Monarchs’ battle won’t resolve quickly, but the heavens over the Northern Sea still need mending. All the sects must act together, we must invite another True Monarch.

"If we let the seawater continue to pour down like this, by the time the True Monarchs return, the Northern Sea will have flooded the wilderness, linked up with the Eastern and Western Seas, and submerged countless sects and territories."

Daoist Master Zipei nodded, clearly taking the matter seriously, and said softly, "Empress Beiyao has manifested often in recent years and is the easiest to negotiate with. Let’s seek her out.

"As for who should lead... naturally, it should be the Yue Cultivating Sect. All who acted such as the Azure Pond Sect, Golden Feather Sect, and the Dragon Clan should contribute. We just wait for Yue Cultivating Sect to make a move."

Daoist Master Pu Yu nodded gently, glanced eastward, and smiled, "All the True Monarchs have gone off to battle in the Outer Heavens, looks like the Dragon Clan is going to seize the thunder."

Eastern Sea.

Waves surged endlessly and the waters gleamed crystal-clear. All kinds of demonic creatures often rose with the wind and rode the waves. Islands were scattered irregularly across the sea like stars in the sky, with demonic creatures and beasts weaving in and out between them.

On a normal day, many cultivators would be seen flying across the sea, but now a sense of panic filled the air. Streaks of escape light flashed across the sky, trailing colorful glows behind them.

The islands across the sea gradually revealed a more ominous presence. The larger islands such as Splitreed Island, Chunyi Island, and Crimson Reef Island had expanded by thirty to forty percent, stretching out for thousands of meters. Marketplaces originally built on the seabed now emerged into view and formation arrays shimmered in the air with radiant light.

Even the mid-sized islands, like Qingsong and Dongliu, had greatly expanded. Cultivators looked out at the sea, their expressions a mix of concern and joy.

Demon dens slowly emerged on the exposed seafloor. Small demonic creatures held tridents in their hands, blankly watching the seawater recede inch by inch. Thunder roared across the heavens and earth, yet not a single drop of rain fell.

Li Qinghong led a group of cultivators from Zongquan Island to survey the area. The island had expanded nearly fifty kilometers and was still continuing to stretch outward, revealing various corals, fish, and shrimp.

There were now over thirty thousand people on Zongquan Island. Children and adults alike stood nervously along the former shoreline, staring blankly in fear. Some bolder ones had already rolled up their pant legs and stepped into the sea, tossing fish, shrimp, clams, and crabs into jars.

Li Qinghong hovered in the air with her spear in hand. Thunder surged beneath her feet and violet light flowed around her but she could not hide the worry in her expression.

She could vaguely see colorful lights rising in the north. But where Li Xizhi was, the Xia Mountain lay north of the Converging Sea and bordered the Northern Sea. From where she stood, in the Scarlet Pristine Sea nearly down to the Southern Sea, she could barely make out anything beyond a few faintly rising flashes of color.

All she could do was have Zong Yan arrange the people and, after waiting quietly for a while, decide to summon Huiyao to inquire further.

As the scouts were dispatched into the sea, Li Qinghong checked the time, quietly concealed her presence and waited in midair.

Sure enough, after waiting patiently for only a short while, a green fish with scaled wings under its ribs burst out from the water. It transformed into a half-human, half-fish form, holding a sea trident.

He finally withdrew his demonic wind, steadied himself, and respectfully said, "Ah! Greetings, Fairy."

Back when they fought the cloud octopus together, he had been terribly frightened by Li Qinghong’s thunder. Thunder was, after all, the righteous path for slaying demonic creatures, and he had submitted wholeheartedly ever since.

Now, seeing that Li Qinghong had already reached the late Foundation Establishment Realm and wore at her waist a small bottle with purple lightning-shaped patterns which radiated a deep and obscure thunderous power. He felt a chill of fear rise again in his heart, After all these years, this female cultivator of purple lightning has grown even stronger. Who knows what level she’s reached now... That’s right, Falling Water and Rising Storm in the Eastern Sea, this is the perfect time for a lightning cultivator.

He kept his head low and eyes down. Being a demonic creature of the Dragon Palace, he knew his place. Li Qinghong did not act arrogantly and asked, "Fellow Daoist, do you know the reason behind the receding seawater?"

Huiyao immediately understood and shook his head repeatedly, answering in a low voice, "Replying to the Fairy... Dingyuan the Dragon Son left some days ago. Now the many local demonic creatures are running about like headless flies. I inquired around several nearby waters, but all I heard were some vague and unreliable rumors."

Li Qinghong nodded, signaling him to continue. Huiyao said, "The word from several Mansion Waters is that Dragon Monarch Beijia and Dragon Monarch Xiyang... dragged down a grotto heaven in Qunyi. As soon as the grotto heaven's entrance opened, the seawater began pouring into it, this is how things ended up like this!"

Li Qinghong had dealt with many demonic creatures over the years, but this was the first time she had heard the name Dragon Monarch Beijia. She asked, "Who’s Dragon Monarch Beijia?"

Huiyao paused for a moment, then suddenly understood and replied, "People like you, who are at the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Realm refer to him as the Dragon King of the Converging Waters."

So it was the leader of the Dragon Clan, the Dragon Monarch of Converging Waters, thought Li Qinghong.

Among the Dragon Clan, there were two well-known Dragon Monarchs. The first was the Lord of Converging Waters, known to commoners and lesser cultivators as the Dragon King of the Northern Sea. He had an extremely long lifespan and was referred to within the Dragon Clan as Dragon Monarch Beijia.

The other was Dragon Monarch Xiyang, who split from an immortal into three forms. Among Golden Core Realm cultivators, he was considered a junior and often appeared in the world which made him more widely known.

Seeing her expression, Huiyao quickly added, "Back in the day, the Dragon King was granted stewardship over the Northern Sea and was gifted the character 'Jia' by an immortal."

Li Qinghong nodded as she listened, though a strange look appeared on her face. She asked, "A grotto heaven? That’s impossible... With the power of those two Dragon Monarchs, how could seawater be allowed to leak into Thundercloud Temple?"

As the two were conversing, thunder suddenly exploded through the heavens and earth. The sea howled as dark clouds rolled, and waves of violet light began to appear in the eastern sky.

Layers of thunderclouds emerged, and a translucent, pale-golden circular outline hovered in the sky. Inside it, pavilions and towers gradually appeared, scattered among the violet thunderclouds.

"A grotto heaven!"

Countless bolts of thunder light emerged from the east. Li Qinghong felt her Immortal Foundation surging within, her internal thunder pool churning as a wave of intense foreboding washed over her. The shaft of her Duruo Spear shimmered with iridescent light, trembling with excitement.

Thundercloud Temple... Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling.

Li Qinghong understood that her destined opportunity lay here. But for now, she could only watch helplessly. Then, riding a streak of lightning within the black winds, she soared into the dark, heavy thunderclouds.

Intense thunder had already begun to spread in the area. Huiyao followed behind, trembling with fear. All around them, within the dark clouds, many cultivators could be seen looking up in stunned silence.

She gazed into the distant east, silently watching, passing through streaks of thunder, a trace of regret in her heart, It's a pity... I can't even touch this thing, and it's already fallen into the hands of the Dragon Monarch.

The Thundercloud Temple’s grotto heaven lay hidden behind the surging storm and thunder, and beyond the pale-golden barrier was a palace complex of thunder suspended in the air.

Countless black clouds gathered, covering the entire Eastern Sea. From time to time, a scale the size of a small mountain would emerge from the clouds, reflecting violet thunderlight so intense that Li Qinghong’s face turned deathly pale. She nearly lost her breath and fell from the sky.

She retreated some distance and saw that the black clouds above the Qunyi Sea resembled an enormous dragon's head, slowly swallowing a violet pearl.

It was now the moment when the grotto heaven and the mortal world overlapped. The scenery inside could be seen with the naked eye. Li Qinghong, having cultivated a perception technique, could clearly make out numerous ancient tomes swirling in the storm and falling like rain onto the palace rooftops.

She looked upward at the structure, the grotto heaven was composed of five thunder platforms. At the highest point stood a grand hall with finely carved eaves, rooftops of gilded copper, and floors paved with violet jade. Atop the ridge of the hall stood a lone, azure figure.

"Yuan Tuan..." Li Qinghong could barely make out her robes fluttering in the wind. She stood there, motionless like a statue atop the great hall, facing alone the dragon’s head whose teeth were as vast as mountains.

Boom!

Thunder roared as the woman and the violet grotto heaven sank into the clouds, like a shelled egg swallowed whole. They vanished from sight, and the Dragon Monarch didn’t even seem to chew before closing its mouth. The brilliant violet-golden light faded between its teeth.

In the final instant, Li Qinghong thought she saw that the woman's azure robes had turned red, vanishing like drifting sand within the depths of the celestial palace.

The black clouds in the sky vanished in an instant, retreating to the horizon as if fleeing, as though they had never appeared. Li Qinghong descended on a streak of lightning, feeling a deep sense of loss. Huiyao followed beside her and asked blankly, "Fairy, why did it suddenly start thundering...?"

Li Qinghong glanced at him quietly, a dazed expression on her face, and shook her head, saying, "The clouds were too thick, the thunder came in waves. I couldn't see clearly."

Both of them rode the wind downward. Huiyao muttered on about this and that, while Li Qinghong focused on calming her emotions.

"Such a surge of thunder... maybe the Dragon Monarch was simply dragging a grotto heaven as he passed through." Huiyao murmured with a tone of longing, "Seems like those from the neighboring waters didn’t have it right. After all, a grotto heaven should rest atop a mountain, not under the sea. There must be another reason."

Li Qinghong no longer hoped to learn anything useful from him. She politely sent him away, then quietly returned to her cave dwelling and sat alone in the upper chamber.

She sat for a while, but the image of the Dragon Monarch swallowing the pearl kept replaying in her mind. Li Qinghong understood, Yuan Tuan was most likely no longer alive.

Trapped in a grotto heaven for over ten years, watching helplessly as her would-be rescuer fell... and then slowly waiting to be consumed by the Dragon Monarch... Senior Yuan, thought Li Qinghong.

Li Qinghong had met Yuan Tuan before, back when she came to take Li Xizhi back to the sect. She seemed gentle and gracious. Later, Li Qinghong learned that Yuan Tuan had secretly intervened during the devil plague to protect Li Xuanxuan, which had made her grateful in her heart.

Azure Crest Manifestation is capable of blessing others, yet unable to secure good fortune for herself... only to fall into the tiger’s jaws in vain.

Whether Yuan Tuan's jade pendant in the Yuan Family still holds effect, I don’t know. But Azure Pond Sect’s soul lamp must already have gone out. As for Xizhi... there’s no need to tell him. He wouldn’t be able to see it anyway, it would only stir unnecessary trouble.

Just as Li Qinghong managed to settle her heart, she suddenly heard a crisp knocking sound.

Knock, knock, knock.

In an instant, Li Qinghong's heart felt as if it had been shattered like frost struck by a hammer, cold and shaken, filling her entire chest. All thoughts fled her mind, leaving behind only pure terror.

Knock, knock, knock...

The sound echoed through the cave dwelling, it was chilling and crisp. Li Qinghong’s expression changed slightly as she quickly gripped her spear and thought, Who’s there?

Zongquan Island was currently under the management of Li Chenghui, with Zong Yan assisting. If either of them needed her, they would activate the formation to summon her or send a voice transmission.

No matter what, it would never come to simply knocking on the door...

Creak...

Before she could respond and just as she picked up her spear, the defensive formation of the cave might as well have been decoration. The stone door at the entrance slowly creaked open, and a pair of cloth shoes stepped steadily inside.

The figure placed one foot inside, then pushed the door further open while stepping forward. As the door swung wide, a smiling face came into view, revealing eight gleaming white teeth.

The newcomer wore azure robes, appeared young, with flowing sleeves and long hair cascading down. His smile gradually faded as he squinted slightly at her, standing with hands clasped behind his back. He was seemingly curious.

His pupils were pale cyan, and he exuded a heavy and oppressive presence just by standing there. Countless rippling green shadows floated around him which overlapped and gleamed with an icy brilliance.

His robe was wide-sleeved and flowing, wholly azure in color, but at the waist hung a golden tassel. Li Qinghong recognized it, it was the uniform of the Azure Pond Sect.

Azure Pond disciples, guest cultivators, Daoists, peak masters, sect masters, and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators all wore similar robes but the details differed. Thanks to Li Xizhi and Yuan Tuan, Li Qinghong could recognize a peak master’s garb at a glance. But this robe, this one was even more ornate.

Her attention lingered on the robe for only a moment, then was immediately drawn to the man’s face.

Li Qinghong stared at him in a daze. She actually recognized this face. Not only did she recognize it, it was perhaps the last face she ever wished to see. Horror surged through her heart in waves as she thought, Chi Buzi!
