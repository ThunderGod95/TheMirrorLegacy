# Chapter 801: The Intercalation of Valley Water

Chi Buzi waited several breaths before the anxious Dangjiang finally stepped forward and bowed.

"Reporting to the Immortal General... this man was personally selected by the Honoured Lord back then and permitted to ascend to the heavens to seek the Dao. Now... he has accrued some initial immortal merit and has come specifically to pay his respects. He hopes only for a word or two of guidance from the Immortal General, that he might have some hope of reaching the Golden Core."

Dangjiang knelt obediently, tugging Chi Buzi’s sleeve with both hands, signaling him to present the token. Although Chi Buzi was a distinguished Great Cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm, he knelt just as readily, his expression impeccably natural and respectful.

"This lowly cultivator has successively offered two Demons for sacrifice in exchange for immortal merit, seeking capital for the Dao," Chi Buzi said. "It is all recorded within this token. I only request the adult's guidance."

Immediately, an Immortal Soldier descended from the platform, accepted the token from Chi Buzi, and carried it straight to Lu Jiangxian, who was disguised as Zhengao.

"My lord," the soldier reported, "the token contains six hundred and forty-one merits."

Zhengao gave a slight nod, glanced at the two, and replied, "Go seek an intercalary position."

Dangjiang no longer understood the conversation. Chi Buzi, too, hesitated. His Azure Pond Sect Pristine Water lineage was formidable, enough to overwhelm most cultivators, but it was precisely because his Dao originated from Pristine Water that his understanding of the Golden Core was surprisingly lacking. Though he had spent years gathering every scrap of information he could find, he was a sharp man. How could he waste an opportunity like this?

He immediately bowed again.

"Milord... this lowly cultivator's lineage is crude, and my cultivation shallow. I am completely in the dark regarding matters of the Golden Core... Only in Anhuai Heaven did I receive the Immortal Lord's pity, granting me this aspiration. The lord's words are too profound; I implore you to elaborate..."

Hearing this, Lu Jiangxian laughed internally.

'He's actually using my name for backing!'

Having read countless volumes and possessing immortal arts as his framework, Lu Jiangxian was far more knowledgeable about the Golden Core than Chi Buzi, whether in practice or theory. He felt quite confident.

This knowledge was a profound secret that could not be transmitted lightly. Chi Buzi was the type who wouldn't act without seeing a reward, but Lu Jiangxian intended to continue using him, so he wasn't stingy.

"Given your current situation," Zhengao said softly, "you cannot attain Fruition Attainment unless that True Monarch Lushui is eliminated. You already know this... Yet, you are a descendant of his lineage, and he is watching you closely. He doesn't even want you to secure a auxiliary position. If you try to confront him directly on the Dao of Pristine Water, you are committing suicide. Only an intercalary position remains viable."

Chi Buzi's breathing suddenly grew heavy. "This lowly cultivator boldly asks... which intercalary position must I attest?" he whispered.

Auxiliary positions and intercalary positions were ethereal concepts to ordinary cultivators. Even the core disciples of the Purple Mansion Realm merely knew the terms existed. Among the mighty Three Sects and Seven Gates, with their complete Golden Core lineages, not one possessed a cultivation method or scripture that clearly defined how to seek a auxiliary or intercalary position.

No matter what secrets he had witnessed previously, Chi Buzi always grasped the crux of the problem. The answer to this question carried the weight of a mountain; its value to the entire world was almost unimaginable.

Yet Zhengao replied as if it were a simple matter, shaking his head. "That depends on your Divine Abilities. Pristine Water and Valley Water have an intercalation. Of the five Divine Abilities, Spring's Echo, Heavy Murk, and Chou-Gui Hidden Form are all intercalations of Valley Water. But you... you just had to go and cultivate Clear Dusk Rain. That makes things troublesome."

Chi Buzi’s mind raced, his expression shifting several times as the implications of that measured sentence washed over him.

'Pristine Water and Valley Water have an intercalation.'

What did this mean? It meant that he, Chi Buzi, could use this to seek the intercalary position of Valley Water!

His composure, which wouldn't crack even if Mount Tai collapsed before him, finally shattered. His eyes revealed a mixture of stunned realization, doubt, and sudden, blinding clarity.

Based on his own cultivation and the ancient texts he’d collected, Chi Buzi had long harbored suspicions about Valley Water and Mansion Water. He had once gambled by speculating that Yingze was the Mansion Water True Monarch, solely as a show of loyalty.

And now, learning that these Divine Abilities were called "Valley Water intercalations," the fog in his mind mostly dispersed. But just knowing that Pristine Water and Valley Water had an intercalation wasn't the solution. The critical questions remained: which immortal foundation must he use as a supplement? And what method must he find to seek the Golden Core?

Countless thoughts erupted in his mind, but he relied on his profound cultivation to restrain his excitement.

"In the past, the seniors of my lineage only sought the auxiliary position of Pristine Water, never daring to dream of an intercalary one. By my generation, we understood the True Monarch's intent and had considered seeking an intercalary path... but I never imagined that Clear Dusk Rain had ruined the entire endeavor..."

Zhen'gao had already picked up a jade slip and begun reading it idly.

"If you hadn't cultivated Clear Dusk Rain," he replied, "this Valley Water Dao would have offered a wondrous affinity. But you did. Clear Dusk Rain is the 'evening rain,' the orthodox fruition of Pristine Water. As such, it conflicts with Valley Water."

Chi Buzi finally understood. His clan had possessed Heavy Murk and Spring's Echo. Only Clear Dusk Rain had come from the Azure Pond Sect's inventory. His suspicious nature immediately flared, placing all the blame on True Monarch Lushui.

"Now..." Chi Buzi pleaded, "I beg the lord to illuminate the path forward!"

Zhengao stroked the token in his hand, and its radiant light immediately dimmed. Dangjiang watched this, his heart aching at the cost, but Chi Buzi paid it no mind, waiting below with utmost reverence.

"Within the Mansion Water path," Zhen'gao said, "there is one called Morning Cold Rain. Are you aware of it?"

Of course Chi Buzi knew. He answered instantly,

"This lowly cultivator has heard of it. The Mansion Water's Morning Cold Rain is often seen in the Eastern Sea. Many descendants of Pristine Water Demons follow this Dao..."

"If you are to attest another Divine Ability," Zhen'gao said softly, "you should cultivate this one."

Chi Buzi froze, deep unease filling him.

After all, if a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator attested the wrong Divine Ability, their progress would be halted permanently. Cultivators in Jiangnan only dared to supplement their path with an outside Dao for their absolute final Divine Ability, and even then, only after meticulous, agonizing calculations to ensure the abilities wouldn't conflict. It was no simple matter.

Furthermore, telling a Pristine Water cultivator to use a Mansion Water Divine Ability to attest a Valley Water intercalary position was utter madness. If he had heard this idea yesterday, Chi Buzi would have slapped the speaker into oblivion. He couldn't fathom it.

Zhengao raised an eyebrow.

"Morning Cold Rain is 'falling snow meeting the morning light, transforming into chilling rain.' The rain is held within the snow; the snow is the rain's creek valley. Within the Mansion Water path, *this* is the Valley Water intercalation. The good news is that it can connect upward to those three Valley Water intercalations, and downward to your Clear Dusk Rain. While not as ideal as cultivating the other two Valley Water paths directly... it counts as a road."

The more Chi Buzi listened, the more sense it made. He nodded quickly, a seed of trust taking root.

No matter what, this method still involved four Pristine Water abilities; it remained within the bounds of worldly convention. Even if he failed to breach the Golden Core, his life would at least be preserved. In contrast, Chi Buzi now felt that the alternative—*not* cultivating Clear Dusk Rain, and instead cultivating three Pristine Water abilities followed by two Valley Water abilities—sounded like the real joke.

'The seniors and classics had long made it clear: cultivating even a single Divine Ability outside one's foundational path meant cultivation would halt permanently. Two? Even if you *could* cultivate them, how many days could you survive before your body exploded?'

He weighed the two roads. He would still choose the four-Pristine Water, one-Mansion Water path. In fact, he was suddenly grateful he had already cultivated Clear Dusk Rain; otherwise, he would have had difficulty refusing the other, suicidal suggestion.

"This Morning Cold Rain..."

Chi Buzi wasn't without the Mansion Water cultivation art, but he was completely ignorant regarding these divine intercalary mysteries. Naturally, he had to ask for the sake of security. His tone was hopeful and earnest, desperate for the general to simply hand him a specialized cultivation method.

Lu Jiangxian had been waiting for this exact question. The carrot was dangling, and Chi Buzi would naturally take the bait. Controlling Zhengao, he chuckled.

"That's easy. Morning Cold Rain is, after all, a Mansion Water method. It's best to modify it to better fit your Dao path. If you have sufficient immortal merit, you can go to the Manor and request a copy. The subsequent Gold-seeking method will be the same. Neither is difficult."

Chi Buzi's heart hammered his ribs. Lu Jiangxian knew how capable this man was and felt a flicker of worry; after all, even he needed time to compose the cultivation method. He feared Chi Buzi might pull off a massive sacrifice—perhaps an entire mountain of Merciful Ones—and demand the method when he couldn't produce it. Faking a Gold-seeking method was beyond his current abilities.

He quickly added a warning: "But I must remind you. My colleagues in the Manor are not as easy-going as I am. They look very unfavorably upon the Purple-Gold demonic path. Stay away from that area. If you need to make a request, have Dangjiang do it for you. The cost will not be low... Work hard."

The excuse was perfectly logical. It even resolved some of Chi Buzi's lingering doubts, lessening his suspicions. He and Dangjiang bowed respectfully and exited the platform. The green-robed man looked utterly refreshed, his spirit soaring.

Dangjiang, however, glanced mournfully at the token in Chi Buzi's hand. Six hundred and forty-one immortal merits were now reduced to a meager forty-one. Chi Buzi didn't care in the slightest.

'What a joke,' he thought. 'The lives of just two Demons? The single sentence, "Pristine Water and Valley Water have an intercalation," is worth the lives of how many Purple Mansion cultivators in my entire lineage?'

Shaohui was waiting outside, holding her pipa. She had always disliked Chi Buzi, but she was an expert at enduring and said nothing, escorting them out. When they reached the courtyard, both men breathed a sigh of relief.

This time, Dangjiang was wary of him, and Chi Buzi mentioned no gifts. He spoke with grave seriousness.

"I am returning this time to slowly accumulate immortal merit. Doing this too often attracts suspicion. The path ahead is one of constant peril, where body and spirit could be annihilated at any moment; it is like treading on thin ice. If I fall, your path of advancement vanishes, too."

"You are safe in the heavens. Please, ask about this cultivation method for me, and what its price is. If you have the chance, gather spirit pills and potent medicines—any aid from the mighty you can find. In doing so, you will also be helping yourself."

"Like I need you to tell me?" Dangjiang spat at him.

Chi Buzi nearly cursed him—*stupid mule*—but restrained himself and vanished from the round pool.

Dangjiang was left staring enviously at the spot, but as he took a step, something suddenly felt wrong.

'Damn it... That Chi dog earns three hundred merits per demon, and I... I'm not even making his spare change! How am I not getting a commission? When a subordinate does the dirty work, shouldn't you skim at least sixty or seventy percent? Otherwise, what’s the point!'

***

Within The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity.

As great snowflakes danced outside, Lu Jiangxian’s form slowly materialized by the table. In the center sat a jade pot, filled to the brim with the dazzling, ocean-like Divine Ability that still pulsed like a captured galaxy.

'Chi Buzi basically believes it... At least this will allow him to cultivate to Peak Purple Mansion. He still has two hundred years. He counts as a hidden card.'

Lu Jiangxian hadn't completely deceived him. According to his own calculations, provided the Gold-seeking method was a match, this path—though bizarre and incredibly difficult—was indeed a viable minor road straight to the Golden Core.

"This Morning Cold Rain cultivation method won't be hard to write. Li Ximing was able to break through relying on Talisman Qi, which proves that Talisman Qi is inextricably linked to Divine Abilities. It possesses the power to sense and nurture them. I only need to write the method up to the Foundation Establishment Realm. That makes it much, much simpler."

Lu Jiangxian had gray talismans in spades, and seven white talismans in his inventory. Although the sacrificial method wasn't recorded, the efficacy of the two talisman grades must differ.

"Chi Buzi is highly capable. When the time comes, I'll reward him with one gray talisman and let him grind out the breakthrough himself. The white talismans I'll save for that fellow Li Ximing. It will speed up the cultivation of his Sovereign's Perilous Tread, so he doesn't keep getting beaten and forced to flee."

He simulated the process using a few created human bodies. As he suspected, once the Purple Mansion Realm was achieved, Talisman Qi could indeed sense the previous Divine Ability and assist in nurturing the next.

"Li Ximing's Audience with the Celestial Gate is not yet at perfection. It will be some time before he's useful."

Dismissing the thought, he checked on Chi Buzi's status—all was normal. Only then did he wave his sleeve. A small, exquisite, seven-colored peacock with a golden beak and golden talons materialized on the floor.

The peacock's true form should have been the size of a mountain, but upon entering the Immortal Mirror's domain, it had been suppressed to this tiny form. Lu Jiangxian scanned it and made his assessment.

'It's far inferior to Fuyu. There are flaws in both its body and soul. Although the Mirror forcibly collected its true spirit, it ultimately possesses no Divine Abilities. It's mediocre fodder. Using it will be boring.'

These Merciful Ones had their heads stuffed with nothing but those sutras, and the Dharma Arts they learned were useless outside their Buddhist lands. Only the base instincts of a peacock remained. Even if he nurtured it, it was just an empty-headed mediocrity.

He had intended to take a soul to pair with Fuyu's Lesser Yin Divine Ability to refine Talisman Qi, but this Merciful One had only cultivation, no innate abilities. Lesser Yin, at least, had other uses. In the end, he decided to simply use the entire peacock.

"Come!"

The entire celestial palace instantly froze. Every Immortal Soldier and General solidified like a statue. The massive ocean of golden incense fire suppressed beneath the vast palace erupted, surging across the heavens, all of it flooding toward the seven-colored glass orb in his palm.

The golden lake that Dangjiang and the others had seen beneath the twelve white jade bridges was merely one small corner. The incense fire from millions of mortals, accumulated year after year, had condensed into a massive lake beneath the palace, and it was now draining at terrifying speed.

Previously, when Lu Jiangxian condensed Talisman Qi, he had never experienced consumption like this, nor had he ever considered if his incense fire reserves were sufficient. Now, the cost for a single azure talisman leaped from a measure of ten thousand to one of millions. Only his accumulated reserves from the last fifty years supported the expenditure. The golden lake's surface dropped lower and lower, but ultimately, it held.

A single point of green light emerged before him. Countless profound patterns, resembling a spider's web, spread through the air. The sounds of immortal bells and ethereal strings played from the void. The nascent Talisman Qi bobbed and swayed, seemingly observing its surroundings with curiosity.

Lu Jiangxian casually caught it, pressing it into his palm. All celestial phenomena vanished. The golden lake below rippled, only half of its volume remaining.

"All preparations are complete. As soon as the Li family's ritual passes, I can bestow this using the Talisman Seed."
