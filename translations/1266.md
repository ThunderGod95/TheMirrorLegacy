# Chapter 1266 Internal Profoundity

Yinling.

Yinling lay within the lands of Luo, the most fertile part of this rich plain. It was originally a flat expanse called the Luo Wilds, but after the Tao family migrated from the east and settled here, they spent generations moving small mountains and hills back to the territory, and the terrain gradually grew undulating.

These small mountains and hills could only be considered enough to create a few mystic realms, most of which were based on the three yins. As they ultimately lacked a majestic spiritual pulse from the earth veins, the place was renamed Yinling.

Above this Yinling, white qi churned and a jade pavilion hung high in the air. An old man and a young man sat opposite each other within the pavilion. The distant aura was in constant turmoil, prompting Tao Jiexing to cast a worried glance toward it as the youth spoke:

"A divine ability wielder has fallen… A pillar of Dawn Qi pierces the heavens. It must be Gongsun Bei…"

"It could only be him."

Xuanwei, with a placid expression, picked up a chess piece and placed it on the board, speaking softly.

"He was bound to fall sooner or later… Seeing as he was led out by Jiang Toushou again, as long as King Wei had the will, his death was certain."

Tao Jiexing picked up a white stone but gazed thoughtfully at the board, unsure where to place it, listening to the man before him continue.

"This Gongsun Bei… was once a pawn of that figure from the Way of Compassion. For him to have reached this point, the Way of Compassion had originally intended to take him in. For some unknown reason, however, that figure who now presides over the Way of Compassion became increasingly unwilling to see him, nor would they issue the order to bring him into their fold, leaving the Way of Compassion unable to intervene."

"Since the Way of Compassion would not accept him, and he refused to join any of the other paths, a stalemate ensued. Sometimes survival hinges on a single thought; how can one afford to hesitate? As King Wei’s pressure intensified, he was naturally cornered."

As his voice fell, the final black stone landed on the board, sealing the flow of qi for the white dragon formation. He added casually:

"It isn't easy. Having cultivated Dawn Qi, he should have known what kind of end awaited him…"

Tao Jiexing said with concern, "But his spell arts and that divine ability, ‘Discourse of the Eight Evasions,’ were both taught by the Han Family. I don’t know if they will be implicated…"

"It matters not."

Xuanwei said, "Old Daoist Master Han is simply too kind-hearted and cannot refuse a sincere plea. King Wei won't go so far as to blame him."

The words had barely left his lips when bells began to toll from the outside world. Xuanwei stood up, his expression growing somewhat complicated.

"He is here."

The old man and the youth strode out of the white jade pavilion. Sure enough, they saw the sky lit with brilliant Heavenly Light and thousands of purple flames, a magnificent spectacle of flowing, vibrant colors. A young man stood amidst that radiant phenomenon.

The man had a grand physique and a majestic aura, but his loose, ink-black robes kept him from appearing overly imposing, lending him a vigorous and nimble air instead. His golden eyes were sharp, his expression serene, and a lone royal battle-axe was fastened at his waist.

Tao Jiexing gave him a quiet look.

This was the first time he had formally met Li Zhouwei.

He had seen all those incidents back then with his own eyes. Vast Cicada had shown greed, and Qi Lanyan had gnashed his teeth in hatred, yet no one had dared to underestimate Li Zhouwei. Even Wei Xuanyin, the Dao Lord of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao, had been mostly helpless and silent.

As for the remaining cultivators and Buddhists, although they appeared indifferent, fear had already taken root in their hearts.

When had it begun? Tao Jiexing could no longer recall clearly; perhaps it was to the credit of his cousin, Vast Cicada.

Tao Jiexing’s gaze lingered for a moment on the royal battle-axe at the man’s waist, his expression complex as he observed the pattern of a leaping qilin.

'It looks like a ceremonial piece, not a weapon of slaughter.'

Yet in his pupils, the axe reflected a dazzling crimson light, and his divine ability, Eye of Galloping Heart, warned him ceaselessly—this axe had slain more than one divine ability wielder!

He simply stood behind his elder with his head lowered, saying nothing.

Xuanwei, for his part, stroked his beard, also remaining silent. He did not seem surprised, yet upon seeing the spectacle in the sky, the emotion in his eyes dimmed.

Then, a figure stepped out from the Heavenly Light. He had the appearance of a middle-aged man with a resolute bearing. He gave a slight bow and said,

"Am I in the presence of Daoist Master Xuanwei?"

Only then did Xuanwei shift his gaze to carefully scrutinize the man, before letting it fall back upon Li Zhouwei. He said softly,

"King Wei has crushed the lands of Luo… such divine might is astonishing. We have truly witnessed it."

His question was posed in a clear and calm voice, neither servile nor overbearing. Seeing the resplendent Heavenly Light, the figure above spoke,

"The Tao family has an otherworldly, immortal bearing, living at such ease."

Xuanwei smiled.

"Has King Wei come to make my Tao family pledge fealty?"

Li Zhouwei looked directly at him and said calmly,

"The Tao family sits high upon Yinling; were you not also waiting for this king to arrive?"

Xuanwei raised a hand and said,

"Then, if you please."

He walked into the pavilion with his hands behind his back. The Heavenly Light that filled the sky instantly descended, rippling with white light as Li Zhouwei stepped into the pavilion with him. He looked at the white qi that covered the ground, a thoughtful expression on his face.

'This Tao family… though their bearing is not as celestial as Wei Xuanyin's, they have the air of recluses and uphold their divine ability with great integrity… There is indeed a profound connection between the two…'

What surprised him even more was that the Xuanwei before him was not a Veiled Yin cultivator!

He was a Daoist Master of the Lesser Yang path!

'The Tao family is known for generations of cultivating the three yins… yet the current Family Head, the one in charge of the Tao family, actually cultivates Lesser Yang…'

This gave him pause, and his heart stirred.

Xuanwei entered the pavilion and stopped in the main hall. He turned to the side in a gesture of invitation, ceding the main seat without another word. The Tao family's attitude was perfectly clear.

Yin Juexi, who followed behind, saw this and his expression brightened. Li Zhouwei strode forward and took the seat. Only then did Xuanwei perform an elegant bow and say,

"From the Great Dao of Comprehending Profoundity, the Shuo Lou Dao-path, and the Profound Pavilion Daoist tradition, a cultivator of the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect, Daoist Master of the Tao family, Tao Junwei, pays his respects to King Wei."

Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect!

Li Zhouwei was momentarily lost in thought before saying with some surprise:

"The Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect?"

The name was not unfamiliar. The Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao, which the Li family knew so well, was first heard of alongside the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect. Together they were known as the Viewing Pavilion faction. The technique Li Ximing used to rapidly form a spirit embryo, the Refining in the Fire of the Viewing Pavilion's Lofty Terrace , originated from this very faction!

'The Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect is said to be a Lesser Yang Daoist tradition… In that case, it is not so strange that this Xuanwei cultivates Lesser Yang…'

Numerous doubts filled Li Zhouwei's mind, but Xuanwei did not seem surprised. He smiled and said:

"Correct."

He stated in a clear voice:

"Our Daoist tradition originates from True Monarch Tian Wei of True Monarch Shou Lou's Dao, and later rose to prominence because of True Monarch Xie Qing. Although we have fallen on hard times, our lineage has not been broken."

Li Zhouwei frowned.

"True Monarch Xie Qing?"

"He was titled True Monarch of the Celestial Decree, Lesser Yang of the Profound Pavilion, and Profound Monarch of Sarcophagus Yang and Lesser Brilliance…"

Xuanwei's expression dimmed slightly, but he smiled.

"He is the one the world knows as the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch. Ancient texts say that his lordship enjoyed presenting himself with the name Xie Qing. In his time as a divine ability wielder, he was called Kuai Xieqing, a name that once rang with great renown…"

'So he had other Daoist titles… Xie Qing. And the world never speaks of them.'

Tao Jiexing had already come forward to serve tea. Li Zhouwei accepted it casually and said,

"I am not familiar with the various branches of Comprehending Profoundity. I'm afraid I will require my fellow Daoist's guidance."

Indeed.

To put it bluntly, Xuanwei was the only orthodox cultivator of Comprehending Profoundity Li Zhouwei had met so far who was even remotely friendly. He was, in fact, the only one with an unbroken lineage who seemed willing to discuss the Golden Core, the Dao Embryo, and the Three Profoundities with him. This was an opportunity of immense value!

Li Zhouwei had discussed this very matter with Li Ximing back then. Breaking into the lands of Luo was not just for its rich resources; these ancient matters hinted at which Dao was in the hands of which Profoundity, and whether one could or could not verify the Dao. This was so crucial that it had even made him temporarily set aside his original plans.

Xuanwei seemed to perceive Li Zhouwei's thoughts. He simply smiled and said,

"The Dao-path of Comprehending Profoundity can be said to be the simplest among the Three Profoundities. Even if I do not speak of it, once King Wei gathers the divine ability wielders of Luo and questions a few of them in detail, it will all become perfectly clear."

He sat up straight and said with great solemnity,

"The Master of Comprehending Profoundity entered the mortal world from the mountains and took four disciples in total. They were Lesser Yang, Guanhua, Shuo Lou, and…"

Xuanwei paused, his gaze a mixture of complexity and gloom.

"And Dongwu."

His expression was not overly dramatic, yet Tao Jiexing, at his side, shifted his gaze in alarm. Yin Juexi bowed his head deeply. Li Zhouwei, too, understood the weight of those two words.

Wu Light, Wu Earth… In this day and age, there were precious few Daoist traditions that dared use the character ‘Wu.’ Who else could it be?

'The patriarch of Wu Light of Luoxia.'

Xuanwei said in a low voice,

"When the Master of Comprehending Profoundity first began teaching his disciples, he did not give them Daoist titles, addressing everyone by their names. The four lords chose their own Daoist titles, which is why they vary so much. Immortal Lord Lesser Yang was the first Lesser Yang in the world, so he simply took those two words as his title."

"The highest-ranking figure under his command was Shao Da… with the surname Qu. Among Shao Da’s disciples were the Shangguan brothers, Zitong and Zidu, both figures of immense renown."

Yin Juexi could not help but nod.

"Who does not know of Zidu who governed the world!"

Xuanwei nodded and continued:

"Shangguan Zidu was the first cultivator to preside over Tongxuan Palace, and also the most powerful in several generations. At that time, cultivators from all over the world came to Comprehending Profoundity seeking the Dao. The trend of the Immortal Profoundity began with him, and there was no one in the world who did not know his name…"

He chuckled, thinking nothing of it, and then said,

"As for Shangguan Zitong… his fame was also considerable. He once went with Xu Che to the Heaven-Governing Gate to ask if they could achieve the Dao. Shangguan Zitong received an affirmative answer, while Xu Che returned in disappointment and thereafter switched to cultivating as a Woven Jade Immortal. But Shangguan Zitong was far too arrogant, and he fell while verifying the Dao…"

"From then on, people knew that those on the Quest for Gold could not divine their own success or failure, or at least, they could not hear an affirmative answer that they themselves deeply believed. Otherwise, even someone as lofty as Qingyi could miscalculate… and it could even lead to dire consequences…"

Li Zhouwei's eyes narrowed slightly as realization dawned in his heart.

'No wonder.'

He kept his expression neutral as he listened to Xuanwei continue with a smile:

"However, other cultivators considered it from the opposite perspective: if Xu Che had returned to the palace back then and risked everything to verify the Dao, might he have succeeded? From this came the admonition that resounded throughout the world…"

Yin Juexi picked up where he left off, reciting with admiration,

"Xu Che feared the Celestial Gate, and idly became a Woven Jade Immortal; Zitong sought to deduce the Dao, and died of pride before the throne."

Li Zhouwei nodded, committing the words to memory, but he noticed another key point in the man’s tone and was inwardly stirred.

'Surname Qu?'

The Daoist Master from Xiyang Abbey who went to the Western Sea back then to handle the Lesser Yang spirit root was surnamed Qu!

'Guanhua the magnificent is his junior disciple-brother, Zidu who governed the world revered him as a patriarch… It all fits. Shao Da can be traced back to the first Lesser Yang, so Xiyang Abbey must be his lineage!'

A trace of regret flickered across Tao Jiexing’s face, but Xuanwei did not elaborate, instead brushing past the topic lightly.

"The Guanhua and Shuo Lou Daoist traditions cultivate the three yins and never had many disciples to begin with. Furthermore, those two masters accepted students based entirely on their mood, without regard for talent. The Xu Che I just mentioned was a disciple of Guanhua… After the True Monarchs were gone, their cultivators became even fewer. After several rises and falls, their lines gradually died out, with most taking refuge in Tongxuan Palace. When Tongxuan Palace was disbanded, the Lord specifically separated those two lineages, and thus the Viewing Pavilion faction was born."

He said softly:

"The Viewing Pavilion faction did indeed begin with the three yins. Later, the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect produced the ‘True Monarch of the Celestial Decree, Lesser Yang of the Profound Pavilion.’ In an instant, the world seemed to open up. The disciples took great pride in him, and many switched to cultivating the three yangs. It was a time of glory."

"So you're saying… the rise of the Viewing Pavilion faction also depended on this Lesser Yang…"

Li Zhouwei's remark was pointed. Xuanwei nodded and said,

"This is why Wei Xuanyin had to be sent to handle the matter of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition back then. This is the karmic debt acknowledged by the mountain!"

Li Zhouwei, however, remained noncommittal. He remembered the affair concerning the Lesser Yang spirit root, the Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant. Based on the information at the time, he had drawn quite a few conclusions.

'It seems now that both Xiyang and Dongwu are on Mount Luoxia, with Dongwu holding the dominant position. Furthermore, his relationship with this Lesser Yang Demon Monarch was not good… Wei Xuanyin was merely a knife, to be used and discarded at will!'

A hint of emotion surfaced on Xuanwei’s face as he said:

"Back then, the Viewing Pavilion was at its zenith. The Daoist tradition grew more orderly: those who followed yin belonged to Guanhua, and those who followed yang belonged to the Profound Pavilion. They gradually shifted their foundations. My Tao family was slowly brought back into prominence, enfeoffed in Yinling to cultivate the three yins for generations…"

"Later, when the Lord fell, the affairs of the world became like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, gradually fading into nothingness. The Viewing Pavilion faction declined precipitously. Guanhua fared slightly better, having some foundation, but the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion, because its Daoist traditions overlapped with certain other lords' and because it had lost its pillar of support, saw its lineage severed for a time."

Li Zhouwei said softly:

"In that case, the Viewing Pavilion must harbor a deep hatred for the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition?"

Hearing this, Xuanwei truly hesitated for several breaths before answering:

"Not really. That Lord’s actions were a mix of righteous and evil. Even back then, there were many disputes within the Viewing Pavilion. There is contention for the Dao among the Three Profoundities, but there is also success in achieving it. We later generations of cultivators, who have inherited these Daoist traditions, no longer have the luxury of worrying about such things."

He said quietly,

"After all, it was out of friendship as fellow disciples of the same Dao that the Wei, Tao, and a few other families, along with Guanhua, took great care to have their children enter the sect and inherit the Profound Pavilion Daoist tradition. And so we had me, Xuanwei, Jiexing, and also… Xuan Chan."

He lifted his head, his gaze fixed on Li Zhouwei.

"Who is also the Vast Cicada slain by King Wei."

This King Wei merely raised an eyebrow and nodded, perfectly composed, as he replied,

"Correct. He once cultivated Bright Yang, which aligns with the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect. He must have been your disciple-brother."

Xuanwei said,

"Xuanwei has no disciple-brother who turned to the Buddhists."

After saying this, he rose to his feet, his lips trembling slightly.

"Li Jieyi failed to cultivate the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, and so he offered his body to the Buddhists. I heard from Kongshu that when he died, his body was shattered but his kasaya remained intact. His wish was fulfilled. Kongshu told me… that it was King Wei who expounded the Dao to grant him this fulfillment, and that I should thank you."

The middle-aged man gritted his teeth.

"Li Jieyi’s sins were grievous, but he is dead. Xuanwei lacks the magnanimity, and the peace of mind, of those Buddhist cultivators. Even if I can find it in myself to let go, I cannot bring myself to offer thanks. I only hope King Wei will permit us a trip to Baixiang to bring his remains back."

He said in a cold voice,

"I want every disciple of our Dao to see what becomes of those who turn to the Buddhists!"

Vast Cicada was dead, his head, as large as a small hill, was sunk in Baixiang Valley—a horrifying sight. Passing cultivators dared not look too closely. Even the Great Adoration Dharma Realm had only taken back a few fragments. From Xuanwei's tone, it was clear he wanted to move the entire head back!

Caught completely off guard by these words, Tao Jiexing looked up in shock, rendered speechless.

Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment, a glimmer of understanding in his eyes.

'The Tao family submitted so readily because they are truly dissatisfied with certain people… Moving that head back here and placing it in Yinling would be an incredible mockery… What a ruthless man!'

He nodded, his gaze complex, and said:

"This matter is not difficult, but it will require some time."

Xuanwei understood his meaning and nodded lightly, lowering his head.

"This wish can be fulfilled sooner or later. Consider it one of the conditions for my Tao family to serve the Great Song!"
