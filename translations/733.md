# Chapter 733: First Encounter

Kong Guxi’s words made the other members of the Kong clan lower their heads. Kong Qiuyan assented, her face a mask of regret as she shook her head.

“First Uncle was merely careless, I beg the Sect Master’s forgiveness… If our other uncles hadn’t been killed at sea by the Changxiao Gate, we wouldn’t be in such a desperate situation… We have troubled the Sect Master.”

Before Kong Guxi could reply, a streak of purple lightning descended nearby, transforming into a man in silver armor. Kong Guxi hurried to greet him, clasping his hands in a respectful bow.

“Brother Chenghui… I’ve sustained some injuries… and I was busy organizing the disciples, so I didn’t have a chance to pay my respects…”

“Sect Master Kong, there’s no need for such formalities.”

Li Chenghui quickly moved to help him up. Kong Guxi was technically of Li Ximing’s generation, making him a senior. He couldn’t let the man bow. “My clan head wishes to see you!” he announced, his tone serious.

As expected, Kong Guxi straightened up and hurried after him. Understanding the gravity of the Profound Peak Gate’s losses, Li Chenghui offered some comforting words.

“I heard that several of your guest elders were wounded, mostly while covering our clan’s cultivators. On behalf of my clan, I thank you.”

“Please, it was our duty,” Kong Guxi replied, doing his best to maintain his composure despite the throbbing pain in his legs, which he suppressed with his spiritual energy. “Without Moongaze Lake, the Profound Peak Gate’s lineage would not survive. You are too kind, Brother Cheng. Though Guest Elder Bai of the Spring's Echo lineage has fallen, Sun Bo, who is more skilled in healing arts, is still with us. Our injuries are manageable.”

When they arrived at the main hall, Li Zhouwei was conferring with Sun Bo about the cultivators’ conditions. Upon seeing Kong Guxi, Sun Bo immediately stepped aside, bowing his head and retreating with a clear understanding of his place.

As a guest elder of the Profound Peak Gate, it was a breach of protocol for Sun Bo to bypass his own sect master and report directly to Li Zhouwei. But power dictates its own etiquette. In these times, only Fu Yuezi remained aloof from the Li clan. Kong Guxi didn’t even bother to take offense.

In his youth, Kong Guxi had his share of arrogance. He had been a profligate son of a powerful clan, and he knew exactly what fueled such pride. Now, without a Purple Mansion realm patron, he was no better than a dog scrounging for bones under the table. Even he had to approach with deference, bowing deeply.

“Greetings, Clan Head!”

“Senior, you mustn’t.”

Li Zhouwei offered a token protest as two attendants moved to help Kong Guxi up. But Kong Guxi remained bowed, his voice firm.

“The Clan Head turned the tide and saved my Profound Peak Gate’s lineage. You deserve this bow!”

He completed the full set of ceremonial thanks. Li Zhouwei waited patiently, and after a few polite refusals, he cut to the heart of the matter.

“Senior, what are your plans for your people?”

Hearing this, Kong Guxi knew he couldn’t suggest returning to the Profound Peak mountain gate. He was well aware that large swaths of Shanji Prefecture had fallen. If his people retreated to the safety of their sect’s Purple Mansion formation, who would be left to defend the wilderness? The Li clan alone?

The Sect Master of Profound Peak immediately prostrated himself, his expression a mixture of fear and humility.

“Reporting to the Clan Head, the defenses of Shanji Prefecture have been breached, and the borders are fraught with danger. I fear any attempt to travel would be intercepted by Guan Gongxiao… I humbly request a place for my people to garrison in the wilderness. We will wait for the situation to stabilize before returning to our mountain.”

A hush fell over the hall. Outside the doors, Sun Bo couldn’t help but turn his head, a pang of guilt on his face. Even Li Zhouwei gave Kong Guxi a second look.

Regardless of whether Shanji Prefecture could be held, Li Zhouwei had already planned to station the Profound Peak Gate’s Foundation Establishment cultivators and disciples in the wilderness. The Li clan’s own members were stretched thin covering their duties, and there was no one to spare. He couldn't just let Kong Guxi and his people retreat to their sect to rest and recuperate. Who, then, would guard the wildlands?

As for allowing them to enter the inner territories of the Prefecture, Li Zhouwei had never considered it. The Li clan had no intention of annexing the Profound Peak Gate. The name had to be preserved. He wasn't even interested in poaching their guest elders.

‘Only this Sun Bo is of some use…’ Li Zhouwei mused. ‘He’s of the Verdant Grove Dao, after all, and most of its abilities are focused on healing. We were looking for someone from the Spring's Echo lineage before, but this Wood Virtue foundation is far superior to a half-baked practitioner of that art.’

Visibly, Li Zhouwei nodded. “Sect Master, you are too formal. The wilderness is your clan’s territory to begin with, so there is no need to speak of making space. I too was concerned that the Profound Peak mountain gate is far away on the shores of Lake Xian, making travel and reinforcements difficult.”

“Since we are of one mind, please select a suitable mountain range in the wilderness as your base of operations!”

Kong Guxi quickly agreed. He also needed to move a portion of his sect’s treasures out of the mountain gate. If the situation became truly unsalvageable and they lost their home, this would give the Profound Peak Gate a glimmer of hope for the future.

He waited with bated breath for a few moments, and then Li Zhouwei finally asked the question he had been dreading.

“Do you have any news regarding the matter of Mount Jingyi?”

Kong Guxi dropped to his knees with a thud and lowered his head as he explained the situation. Li Zhouwei listened with a tightening frown. When Kong Guxi finished, his brow relaxed, and he shook his head.

“Sect Master, this clan member of yours… is he truly unwilling to see you?”

He stared intently into Kong Guxi’s eyes, which were filled with a mixture of misery and terror that seemed genuine. The beleaguered sect master then presented a letter written by his own brother. After reading it, Li Zhouwei offered some counsel.

“Overseas sects can’t be trusted. Having left the clan at a young age, it’s unlikely he feels any loyalty to the Kong clan. Let it be.”

He dismissed Kong Guxi, but then added a probing reminder. “However, my word is not final on this. You will have to speak with the Daoist Master about it. When he returns, I will send someone to fetch you.”

At these words, the half-eased heart of Kong Guxi leaped back into his throat. He sighed and retreated to find Sun Bo for treatment. Li Chenghui escorted him out, then returned to Li Zhouwei’s side, a thoughtful expression on his face.

“Daoist Master Changxi chose well,” Li Chenghui remarked with a sigh. “Kong Guxi may lack strategic brilliance, but he knows when to let go, acts decisively, and is willing to lower his head. Those qualities alone… are enough to save the Profound Peak Gate!”

Li Zhouwei nodded in agreement. “He may be a mediocre leader in times of peace, but in a crisis, he is a pillar of strength, a fine steed for a collapsing dynasty. He sees the situation clearly and can swallow his pride. You say ‘those qualities alone,’ but how many can truly do the same? When ruin is at hand and life and death are decided in a few choices, how many could match him?”

Li Chenghui concurred, but then his tone turned worried. “But with the Daoist Master yet to return and the situation with Mount Jingyi in flux, the road ahead will be even more difficult.”

Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal. “The worst that can happen is we give up Shanji Prefecture and the Profound Peak mountain gate. It’s not as if we’ll gain nothing. The Profound Peak cultivators are the ones on the front lines anyway. Setting aside the Capital immortals Dao, who were our enemies from the start, as long as our clan is careful, this is a venture with guaranteed returns.”

“But we can’t just abandon Shanji and the Profound Peak Gate from the outset, especially since we’ve never even set foot inside… a hasty retreat would damage our reputation. It's better to defend and retreat step by step than to have never possessed it at all.”

In truth, aside from the loss of An Siwei, the Li clan had suffered no substantial damage in the great battle—just some minor territorial setbacks and injuries. With a Purple Mansion realm cultivator backing them, as long as their people were safe, nothing else was a major issue. He paused, his thoughts lingering on An Siwei’s fate for a moment, before his eyes fell upon the letter from Mount Jingyi. After a moment of contemplation, he spoke again.

“You say the situation with Mount Jingyi is in flux. I’m not so sure.”

Li Chenghui looked up as Li Zhouwei continued. “It’s hard to say if Daoist Master Xuanyi is truly being held up by the Chunyi Dao, but this Kong Gumo of Mount Jingyi… his refusal to help may not be a complete disregard for the Kong clan.”

“If I were Changxi, I would certainly want to leave behind a few bloodlines as a contingency. Kong Gumo might be Changxi’s final arrangement. What if my Li clan went back on our word? What if we didn’t shelter the Kong clan, but instead took their treasures and carved up their territory with the Capital immortals Dao? Or worse, what if we tried to curry favor with the mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator Yehui and threw the Kong clan to the wolves?”

“In that case, the Kong clan within the seas would be annihilated, without even a direct heir remaining. Kong Gumo, the son who severed all ties, would be the true last ember of the Kong clan. As the disciple of a Purple Mansion Daoist Master, he is guaranteed to reach Foundation Establishment… and by refusing to aid his family, he appears to be a completely ungrateful wretch. The other Purple Mansion Daoist Masters would not be so quick to kill him in front of Daoist Master Xuanyi.”

Li Zhouwei spoke as he searched through some books. Li Chenghui immediately grasped his meaning.

“Clan Head, you’re suggesting… Daoist Master Xuanyi received a favor from Changxi, and the condition wasn’t to save the Profound Peak Gate, but rather to stay out of the conflict and protect Kong Gumo?”

“Not necessarily,” Li Zhouwei said, picking up a brush. “Changxi was a clever man, and clever men don’t make trouble for themselves. Since he told our clan that Mount Jingyi would be an ally, the agreement likely included helping the Profound Peak Gate, but the terms were probably flexible—major or minor aid, mandatory or best-effort, at his discretion. He could fulfill the letter of the agreement by skirting the edges. That way, he’d have an explanation ready when our Daoist Master comes calling.”

“This matter isn’t settled yet. We shouldn’t place too much importance on Mount Jingyi. In the affairs within these seas, for the most part, we can only rely on ourselves.”

Li Zhouwei paused, his brush hovering over the paper. A genuine look of worry finally creased his features.

“All of this is secondary. My greatest concern is that the Daoist Master has yet to return.”

No matter how dire the Profound Peak Gate’s situation became, it was ultimately their problem. The Li clan could withdraw. Li Zhouwei was confident he could handle any new development. The only one who could not afford to have a mishap was Li Ximing. If something happened to him, not only would the Li clan and the Profound Peak Gate be finished in an instant, but Li Zhouwei himself would become a fugitive, forced to flee overseas.

***

The Great Void.

In an expanse of empty darkness, Li Ximing sat silently upon the Jewel Steps, cloaked in Profound Light.

Above him, a Celestial Gate towered into the blackness. Dragon banners and phoenix chariots drifted through it in a silent procession. Golden-armored and golden-robed figures stood frozen upon the gate like statues in various poses.

Only the platinum-gold canopies stirred gently, shedding streams of Profound Light that fell like countless golden threads.

Three Jewel Steps, each several feet high, led up to the gate. Li Ximing sat cross-legged on the highest one, his body wreathed in surging purple flames, his hands forming a seal in silent meditation.

Beyond the gate, a thick, dark-purple radiance pulsed like a fog, encroaching and receding, nearly blending with the blackness of the Great Void. Every so often, the Profound Light would disperse a cluster of it, revealing an even denser concentration of divine power that had the entire Celestial Gate locked down.

Yehui hadn't spoken a single word. He had simply brought his divine ability to bear within the Great Void, forcing Li Ximing to sit and counter it. A suffocating silence hung between them.

Li Ximing could even sense that his opponent had no desire for a full-blown battle; he merely wanted to contain him here.

Although he possessed the Profound Peak Gate's great treasure, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, which would allow him to escape and rush to Li Zhouwei’s aid in a crisis, he knew Yehui also had his own methods. Li Ximing didn’t want to truly fight him. He sat quietly, though the feeling of being constrained was far from pleasant.

Yehui was undoubtedly stronger. Li Ximing could feel that his opponent’s divine ability was perfectly calibrated, blanketing the Great Void. Shrouded by the Sorrowful Southern Water, he couldn’t even gauge the dimensions of the space around him. All he could see was the small patch of ground beneath his feet, which faced the wilderness below.

Seeing Guan Gongxiao and the others being forced to retreat brought him a measure of relief.

‘The dead are all Profound Peak cultivators, so it’s no loss to us,’ he calculated. ‘As for the territory we’ve secured in Shanji Prefecture… our clan won’t be guarding it. I wonder if the Purple Smoke Gate would be willing to take it…’

Even though the Li clan had repelled the Capital immortals Dao, Li Ximing knew they couldn't possibly hold all the newly acquired land. The border was simply too long, and it would become less defensible over time. After such a major battle, both sides had withdrawn to rest. This victory only meant that the Li clan now had the right to dispose of the remaining territory in Shanji Prefecture.

‘If not, I can ask Sumian of the Xuanmiao Temple and Lingmei of the Sword Gate. Both of their territories border it… better to let them have it than the Capital immortals Dao!’

These were matters to be dealt with upon his return. Li Ximing cleared his thoughts. The purple light before him showed no signs of weakening. In one hand, he held a gold-patterned profound pearl, ready to flee.

But then a second thought gave him pause.

‘The Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger is a rare and powerful spiritual artifact. Although it belonged to Daoist Master Changxi and has been seen before, Yehui only arrived in Jiangnan a little over a decade ago. It’s very likely he isn’t familiar with it. If I use it to escape now, I’ll reveal a powerful tool for nothing. He’ll be wary of it in the future, and I’ll lose a valuable element of surprise.’

Acting on the principle of keeping a trump card hidden if possible, Li Ximing remained still. After a quarter of an hour, Yehui still hadn’t spoken. Li Ximing sighed softly and called out in a clear voice, “Friend Daoist, what guidance do you have for me?”

He waited a few breaths before Yehui’s figure emerged from the depths of the Great Void. The man looked up, his eyes gazing at him from beneath his brow. “Daoist Friend Zhaojing,” he began, “are you now willing to discuss the matter of the Profound Peak Gate?”

‘To hell with your Profound Peak Gate. Just drop this wretched divine ability of yours and let me go…’

Li Ximing paused for a moment before replying, “Senior Changxi entrusted the Profound Peak Gate to myself and Daoist Master Sumian. It is my duty to ensure the sect’s stability. Since Friend Daoist Yehui is willing to talk, I am willing to listen.”

Yehui cradled the ceremonial-looking Dharma sword in his arms, his expression calm. “I’ve heard,” he said suddenly, “that the Bright Yang lineage is not skilled in evasion arts. If I were to engage you in a discussion of the Dao and keep you here for, say, three to five years, I imagine it would be rather unpleasant for you, no?”

Li Ximing frowned. It was true that he was not skilled in evasion arts, and his Audience with the Celestial Gate had no such related abilities. Yehui, with his powerful divine ability, was more than capable of suppressing him. However, he had the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger to compensate for this weakness. Whether he could actually escape was an open question.

But he didn’t know the full extent of Yehui’s abilities, and he had never truly fought a Purple Mansion cultivator before, let alone a mid-stage one. After some consideration, he decided to hear the man out. “What is it you propose, Friend Daoist?”

Yehui’s tone suddenly softened. “There is a cultivator in the Profound Peak mountain gate named Kong Haiying. If you could take care of him, our two clans could sit down and talk about dividing the Profound Peak Gate’s territory…”

The man raised an eyebrow, a smile playing on his lips. “I know your clan values its reputation. We can put on a show of fighting. When we reach the border we’ve agreed upon, we can stop. The Profound Peak cultivators will be eternally grateful and serve you like dogs, and I will have eliminated a major threat. Wouldn’t that be a win-win?”
