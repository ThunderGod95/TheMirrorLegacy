# Chapter 892: Registering the Name

Grotto-heaven.

The Moon Laurel swayed gently, faint silver light echoing beneath the tree. A bone-chilling wind swept across a white jade platform suspended between heaven and earth.

Lu Jiangxian slowly raised his hand, projecting the reflection of an ancient bronze mirror from the Great Void.

The mirror was no larger than his palm, encircled by a dark, metallic border. Intricate patterns converged at its base, where a gemstone as bright as a star was inlaid.

'This piece from the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition... it's not a mirror fragment.'

The gemstone from the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition was actually part of the mirror's body. It was called the Name Ascending Stone. Inlaid upon the mirror, they were originally one and the same. This was the origin of the saying: "Inscribed on the Profound Register, registering the True Name"!

The command Li Ximing had heard didn't come from nowhere. It was precisely because this treasure had returned, causing the Immortal Mirror's divine power to surge, that a new change had occurred.

The Name Ascending Stone had a pleasant name, but its function was extremely tyrannical. If someone relaxed their mind and was struck by its profound light, a trace of their True Spirit would be registered upon the Name Ascending Stone, never to be erased. If they possessed a Talisman Seed, they could then use this to ascend into the World within the Mirror.

But if a person's True Spirit was registered on the Name Ascending Stone *without* them having received a Talisman Seed, they would not only be bound just as tightly, but they would also lose all control over their thoughts, life, and death. They would be completely at the mercy of the Immortal Artifact's master, all while receiving none of the Talisman Seed's benefits.

And though such people could fly into the World within the Mirror, they had no choice in the matter. The moment they were summoned, they would lose their soul, slamming headlong into the Name Ascending Stone.

Of course, even if a person was unwilling to relax their mind, it made no difference. So long as their physical body was destroyed in the presence of the Immortal Artifact—exposing their Shengyang Acupoint—and they attempted to reincarnate using methods like the Diverse Mansion or Buddhist Attainment, their True Spirit would be exposed for a brief instant. In that moment, the Name Ascending Stone's profound light would capture it. The end result was the same.

And if a person's soul and body entered the mirror willingly, it was like walking straight into a trap. They would be instantly bound to the Name Ascending Stone, with no hope of washing the mark away.

'How tyrannical... I can't tell if this is an Immortal Artifact or a Demonic Artifact...'

Lu Jiangxian reviewed these divine properties one by one. Thinking of the abilities of the Talisman Seed and the Talisman Pill, he realized they truly stemmed from the same source. He couldn't afford to relax his guard for a moment.

'If this Immortal Artifact were introduced to the world, the Talisman Seed could be given to capable subordinates, while everyone else could be registered with the Name Ascending Stone. Couldn't one raise batch after batch of loyal manpower that way?'

As he pondered this, a doubt arose.

'If that so-called "past life" of mine had this ability, why would he have complained that the cultivators under the Moonlight Origin Mansion were not united? Why would he even *need* them to be united? Just register their names, draw their souls into the mirror, and all their little schemes would be useless...'

It wasn't just that. His doubts about the Immortal Mirror were growing.

"The Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition's legacy comes from the Jiangbei Wanling Upper Sect. But the Wanling Upper Sect's Daoist tradition was already broken back when the Moonlight Origin Mansion still existed in the world... Doesn't that mean this thing fell into the hands of the Wanling Upper Sect long ago? How could the Immortal Mirror in the hands of my 'past life' have been complete?"

The master of the Moonlight Origin Mansion definitely had this Immortal Mirror. He was said to be an unrivaled master of formations and talismans, with few opponents in the world. If not an Immortal Lord, he must have at least reached the Dao Embryo realm!

"The Immortal Mirror can sense its own fragments. With his power, wouldn't entering and exiting the Secret Diffusion Grotto-heaven have been child's play? He could have just taken it... This means... I am still within a plot he laid."

Lu Jiangxian could only fall silent, studying the mirror.

'The Name Ascending Stone has a limited range and also relies on the Talisman Seed. The range of one's divine sense is a given, but for anyone outside that range to register their name in the mortal world, their soul must connect upward or downward with the Name Ascending Stone. This requires a Talisman Seed to act as a receiver, preventing detection by others. After all, only the Talisman Seed has this kind of responsive power. This part isn't difficult. I have a surplus of Talisman Seeds right now, and it's not like one person occupies one slot. It just needs to respond and connect at the right time. Placing a few inside should be more than enough!'

Lu Jiangxian currently had twelve Talisman Seeds. Eight were with the Li family, leaving four in his hand. His supply was dwindling, but it was still sufficient. He could place a minimum of one inside and still have three available for use.

He stretched out his hand. Four white pellets connected end-to-end and flew into the Name Ascending Stone for its use. Only then did he turn his gaze back to the Great Void.

'The Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition... was actually preserved...'

Because the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was ambushed by Buddhist cultivators, the platform Tinglan had established in Jiangbei had also collapsed. The old scene of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition swarming in to carve up immortal resources within the Grotto-heaven was no more... To put it bluntly, in past years, it was a trade with Luoxia. The Grotto-heaven's descent was Luoxia's compensation to the Supreme Yang. Now, they were just running errands for Luoxia for free. They had suffered casualties and gained almost no benefits.

Now, the True Monarchs in the Great Void had departed, and Jiangbei was not as dangerous as before. Lu Jiangxian observed this, sensing that something was wrong.

'What's more, although the Golden Feather Sect is under Luoxia's jurisdiction, many within it have dissenting hearts. In the past, they constantly flirted with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, trying to curry favor. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was also eager to stabilize the Golden Feather Sect. But now, they've blatantly abandoned the Golden Tang Gate, breaking their tacit understanding with the Azure Pond... It seems Jiangbei is still turbulent with hidden currents...'

He waved his hand, dispersing the phantom image. With a flick of his wrist, the Name Ascending Stone flared with brilliant light. Several white talismans drifted out from it, each moving as if it had a spirit of its own, hanging themselves on the branches of the Moon Laurel.

'Jinlian, Five-Eyed, Buzi...'

The white talisman for Jinlian flipped over, revealing Dangjiang on its back. Although that Maha Jinlian had only come once and had his soul split, this trace of his True Spirit couldn't escape. His connection to the World within the Mirror was now even deeper than the others'.

Although Jinlian had healed his physical injuries, the damage to his soul was not so easily mended. He must have used some unknown spiritual medicine in secret, as he no longer looked like someone suffering from a missing part of their soul.

'I don't need any restrictions now. With a single thought, be it Five-Eyed or Jinlian, they have well and truly fallen into my hands.'

Lu Jiangxian took advantage of the situation, opening up a pavilion in the Grotto-heaven for the Li family to use. His mind settled, he thought:

"I'll use this opportunity to establish contact and pass down the method for acquiring cultivation arts, along with that immortal's abode."

...

Secret Vault Profound Seven Pavilion of the Saintly Purity Palace.

Clouds of mist drifted through a bright courtyard where ancient trees stood tall. A youth with pale turquoise eyes leaned against a branch, a token hanging from his waist. He held a scroll in one hand, reading intently, while sipping from a silver flask in the other, appearing completely at ease.

At the base of the tree, two attendants waited, stacks of books in their arms, standing as still as statues. After a while, the light on a jade table nearby began to flicker, emitting a low hum.

The youth shot up like a startled cat, leaping from the tree in an instant. With two quick movements, he landed by the table, tossing the silver flask aside with a loud clatter. Overjoyed, he shouted:

"Which fellow Daoist has come to visit!"

With Immortal Official Liu having descended to the lower realm and no word from Chi Buzi, life these past few years had been miserable for him, Dangjiang. He immediately bolted, kicked open the door, and strode out. He didn't even bother closing the courtyard gate, taking several large strides forward until he was among the clouds, where he squinted, searching intently.

Standing in the clouds was a Daoist in pale golden robes. His features were regular, though not handsome. If not for a small, bright mark flickering between his brows, he would not have seemed special at all.

The youth hurried forward and smiled.

"This humble one is Dangjiang. Greetings, fellow Daoist! Might I ask which Immortal Palace you hail from?"

Li Ximing, suddenly faced with this person, did not dare to be disrespectful. He quickly moved to greet him and replied:

"This humble one is... Zhaojing..."

As for which Immortal Palace, Li Ximing naturally couldn't answer. But just as he said this, he suddenly remembered something, and his expression changed. He thought:

'...Dangjiang...'

'Dangjiang? The Immortal Official of the Dangjiang River Palace, serving under the Immortal Lord!'

When Chi Buzi left the Li family all those years ago, the family had heard this name. Li Qinghong later met Chi Buzi again and heard that this Dangjiang was supposedly already dead. He didn't know if this was the same person...

'It can't be that this Dangjiang *is* Chi Buzi, can it...'

Li Ximing hadn't been present when Dangjiang was at the Li estate; he had only heard secondhand accounts. Now, meeting him face-to-face, Li Ximing didn't dare assume, and Dangjiang certainly didn't recognize Li Ximing. The youth was simply crying tears of joy.

"Finally, another living voice!"

Dangjiang looked Li Ximing up and down, asking enthusiastically:

"Fellow Daoist, are you... a soul?"

Li Ximing quickly cupped his hands and replied:

"Reporting to the Immortal Official, this junior received guidance in the lower realm and ascended to the Heavens. I am currently completely bewildered and cannot make sense of my surroundings..."

"Someone from the lower realm?!"

Dangjiang's expression changed instantly. Although he was only a Collator, this entire area was managed by Shaohui. Something major must have happened. His gaze burned with intensity as he replied:

"How rare! Why don't you come with me to see the Lord!"

He then smacked his forehead, as if suddenly realizing.

"My apologies, my apologies. I must find a body for you first."

He led Li Ximing back into the courtyard. The two attendants came forward to greet them. Dangjiang nonchalantly grabbed one and held him fast, grinning.

"This attendant has an empty body; his soul isn't present. His Dharma Body isn't weak, either. He's the most suitable!"

Li Ximing examined him closely, but his heart was filled with doubt. A physical body was not something to be taken lightly. If this was a trap, the loss would be fatal!

He secretly called out to the Immortal Mirror, intending to probe the attendant. But who could have known? The moment he uttered the incantation, streams of white light burst forth from his soul. A Profound Pearl Talisman Seed appeared out of thin air. A shock like a bucket of cold water washed over him as the Talisman Seed *actually transformed* into a physical body.

This body was identical to his own. Even the pale golden Daoist robes materialized from nothing, draping over his form.

He stood firm in the courtyard, feeling his various divine abilities re-attaching to his Dharma Body. He finally felt solid, grounded. His Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities had returned.

"Huu..."

He let out a breath, his confidence returning. Dangjiang's eyes darted, sensing something unusual. He exclaimed in admiration:

"Fellow Daoist, you actually have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation... No wonder you have such bearing! May I ask which territory in the lower realm you come from, and which family?"

Li Ximing bowed slightly. He sensed an object in his sleeve. Focusing his mind, he saw that the token from the pavilion was now tucked inside his cuff. He replied:

"This humble cultivator's surname is Li. I cultivate on a small lake."

The moment he finished speaking, Dangjiang's expression changed dramatically. His eyes went wide, his face a mask of disbelief and sudden joy. He stammered:

"Do you have... a token? A token of identity?!"

Li Ximing lifted his sleeve and took out the token. When Dangjiang saw the character 'Li' on it, his eyes immediately reddened. His lips trembled as he cried out:

"It really is Li... Fellow Daoist, you've made me suffer!"

He had been grumbling about 'Immortal Official Li' for who knows how long, and now someone with the surname Li had finally arrived. He began to pour out his grievances:

"Lord Li went down to the lower realm to reincarnate and face his trials, leaving me to manage all the affairs of this palace! How can I possibly handle it all? The scrolls and books are piled up like mountains..."

"Thankfully, Lord Liu... has taken good care of me, giving me an errand or two to keep me entertained. Otherwise, I would have worked myself to death!"

Hearing this, Li Ximing's mind buzzed.

'Reincarnation? What reincarnation? Could it be... me?'

The Li family had long speculated about the Immortal Mirror's origins. Now that the Immortal Mirror also contained a Grotto-heaven secret realm, its background seemed even more profound. The Supreme Yin Moon Radiance that had gushed forth every night back then pointed directly to that revered Immortal Mansion!

The person Dangjiang spoke of was undoubtedly the Immortal Mirror's previous master. Hearing the words 'reincarnate and face trials,' Li Ximing almost immediately locked onto a suspect.

'It must be Li Jiangqun, who was besieged and killed by the great families all those years ago! That pavilion, that small courtyard... they must have been left by him. And the Moonlight Origin Mansion inheritance he obtained is probably inextricably linked to the heavens!'

He looked at Dangjiang, who was sighing with deep resentment, and immediately cupped his hands.

"I'm afraid the Immortal Official is mistaken. My family has worshiped an Immortal Artifact for generations, which is how we gained the opportunity to walk the Daoist path again. We don't know any Immortal Official. I myself am just a minor cultivator."

The joy that had just ignited in Dangjiang was extinguished in an instant. He froze for a moment.

"It's not you..."

Logically, the person before him had no reason to lie. Dangjiang's heart sank as he mused inwardly:

'If it's not you... it must at least be your family. Some ancestor, someone from the heavens. They get to go down to the lower realm and have fun, while I'm stuck here toiling like an animal!'

His gaze then fell on the aura of Bright Yang on Li Ximing, and he finally realized.

'He cultivates Bright Yang... It seems he's similar to Chi Buzi. Chi Buzi is trapped beneath the Pristine Water, but this one is in an even more awkward position...'

'First, there was a Chi Buzi, and now a Bright Yang Zhaojing... Whose Fruition Attainment are they trying to shake? The great lords in the heavens... they are playing a very big game!'

He felt a cold, sharp thrill at his own deduction and, for a moment, forgot to speak. Just then, a stream of light flowed through the clouds. A streak of color shot down and materialized in the courtyard as an Immortal General.

The Immortal General was clad in silver-white armor and wore a sword at his side. His presence made Dangjiang forget everything else and immediately kowtow. The Immortal General, however, stopped when he saw Li Ximing and smiled.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist!"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. As he looked, he found the general's sharp eyes and brows intensely familiar. He was so taken aback he almost cried out.

'Such a strong resemblance!'

Fortunately, he had excellent control over his emotions and showed little reaction. He followed suit and bowed, returning the greeting. The Immortal General smiled.

"I am the Supreme Yin's Luminous Immortal General, Zhengao. Congratulations, fellow Daoist! I received an order from the Supreme Yin Immortal Palace. It said an Immortal Official's command token had activated, signaling a return to position. The Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance has reopened, so I came to meet you."

Li Ximing quickly bowed. Dangjiang remained kneeling, motionless. Zhengao turned and led Li Ximing away, speaking softly:

"The Immortal Palace has been sealed, and the heavens never interfere in the affairs of the mortal world; everything is decided by the Immortal Artifact. We should not have brought you up here. However, the Immortal Order for the High Firmament Pavilion contained a remnant left by Immortal Official Li, which you have now received. That is why this trip was necessary."

"That Immortal Order for the High Firmament Pavilion has already been registered in the heavens. When you return, fellow Daoist, you will be able to freely enter and exit the High Firmament Pavilion."

Joy sparked in Li Ximing. The benefits of a Grotto-heaven were immense; no family would ever have too many, but he hadn't dared to hope for it. He expressed his thanks, but before he could say more, Zhengao continued:

"The Immortal Palace has not yet manifested in the world. After these seven days, it will be sealed once more. Since you were fated to inherit this Immortal Order, it contains the Immortal Merits you all have accumulated over the years. It also corresponds to the Profound Seven Pavilion. If you require cultivation arts, you can request them from the High Firmament Pavilion."

"This Immortal Order holds three hundred and fifty-seven Immortal Merits. It has already been used to exchange for several Purple Mansion Realm-level spell arts, which you can view. As for sacrificing demons, eliminating devils, and suppressing divergent Daos—all are sources of Immortal Merits. For those in the lower realm, this is a significant opportunity."

Li Ximing quietly breathed a sigh of relief. He listened as Zhengao said:

"Just be careful. When the heavens close, this token means you are occupying Immortal Official Li's position. Do not let anyone at the True Monarch level see it, or it will cost you your life."

Li Ximing had experienced too much in one day. For a moment, he didn't know what to feel, as if he were in a dream. He only lowered his voice and said:

"I will obey the revered Immortal's command!"

Zhengao finished and said sternly:

"One last thing: the affairs of the heavens must not be leaked. You must all strive hard in the lower realm. If the day comes when you ascend to Fruition Attainment and become a True Monarch, you will have the chance to ascend as an immortal and we shall meet again."
