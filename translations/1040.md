# Chapter 1040: A Desperate Gambit

The thought surfaced, sudden and persistent, unsettling him. But what truly struck Minghui speechless was his own disciple-brother, Mingxiang…

The Vajra Scepter had already been sent flying, and the Grand Ascension was about to be lost. Yet, Mingxiang merely frowned, forming a hand seal before his lips.

"By the sacred stork's profound mystery, golden cicada, fly!"

'My dearest disciple-brother... I'm begging you, stop! That thing cannot be allowed to fly!'

Minghui was frantic, his eyebrows practically singed with anxiety. But despite the turmoil in his heart, he couldn't just stand by and watch. Steeling himself, he had to add fuel to the fire. The radiance in his hands converged, and mid-motion, he summoned a stream of light shaped like a lotus blossom, which cascaded gracefully downward.

As the light fell, the entire sky filled with a pale pink luminescence, as hazy as a fine mist. It evoked a disorienting sensation of drunken dreams and blissful oblivion, a feeling of forgetting one's very home.

The illusion was secondary. The true purpose was the jade-like dew that fell from the Great Void, striking Li Zhouwei's dharma body drop by drop and raising puffs of white smoke.

Minghui's grasp of the battle was, after all, sharp. He knew that Li Zhouwei didn't care about taking damage right now; his real fear was being delayed by another spell art or Enlightened Artifact, forcing him back onto the defensive. While the spell art he had just unleashed was insidiously corrosive to the dharma body—a perfectly valid tactic—it did nothing to hinder his opponent's next move.

As expected, Li Zhouwei paid it no mind. He tightened his grip on the halberd's shaft and struck its butt with his palm, causing the jade-green light coating the Grand Ascension to shatter like icicles. Before the fragments could even scatter, the long halberd spun back into his grasp.

"CLANG!"

A thunderous roar shook the river below into a frenzy and made the assembled cultivators gasp. The entire shaft of the Grand Ascension hummed and trembled, having just plucked something from the Great Void.

The object was tiny, no bigger than a finger, yet it was a fearsome, threatening thing: a small, golden cicada. It was caught on the halberd's crescent blade, its iridescent wings releasing a fog of imprisoning power. The Grand Ascension bent taut once more under the heavy impact.

'No weaker than that Vajra Scepter!'

At this stage of the fight, Li Zhouwei's assessment was clear. Chiluo was heavily wounded and had fled. The Five-Eyed was focused on self-preservation and was no longer a threat. Minghui had already been in contact with him. The greatest danger was Mingxiang.

'His cultivation is the highest, and he has yet to use any powerful spell arts. But the two Enlightened Artifacts in his possession are specifically designed to counter Mahas and cultivators who excel at Body Divine Abilities... He strikes like a ghost in the middle of this siege... making him even harder to deal with!'

If not for his golden pupils, Li Zhouwei would never have been able to intercept the swiftly darting golden cicada.

But at that very moment, a sandstorm erupted between heaven and earth. A boundless, pale yellow dawn light descended from above. An endless expanse of gold materialized beneath Li Zhouwei's feet, forcing him to look up. His golden eyes swept around, seeing nothing but white light. In an instant, he made his decision. The Grand Ascension flipped, releasing the golden cicada.

"VMMMM!"

The Campaign Cloak behind him billowed up, wrapping around his chest like a living creature. The golden light was instantly enveloped, and despite the Grand Ascension having already dissipated much of the force, the cloak still emitted the dull sound of tearing silk.

Seizing the opening, Li Zhouwei spun around again, only to be met by a descending jadeite skull wreathed in violet lightning.

'Taixi…'

The man was using all his strength to suppress the Spiritual Treasure in his hands. He was trying to protect the golden artifact while preventing the Pure Yang Bracelets from escaping. His face had gone pale, but he was willing to pay any price to free up a hand and obstruct him for even a moment.

A battle of divine abilities could turn in the blink of an eye. This single moment of obstruction was all it would take to block his last sliver of room to maneuver, allowing the illusory platform beneath his feet to blaze with radiance and solidify.

Despite Li Zhouwei's profound cultivation, he was winded and his chest felt tight after weathering the relentless siege. Although the purple-gold thunder mace still hung unused in the sky, the Five-Eyed's spell art was about to descend, sealing off the heavens completely. Li Zhouwei could no longer access it. Left with no choice, he acted on instinct, the space between his brows flaring as he hastily deployed Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light.

"Vmmm…"

A brilliant light shot through the sky. Fortunately, he had practiced Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light for many years and had perfected it. Even when used in a rush, it instantly submerged the golden artifact, barely managing to pin it in place before him.

Yet, at such a perfect opportunity, the swirling sandstorm seemed held at bay by some unseen force, having no effect whatsoever. This stunned nearly all the Buddhist cultivators. Minghui and Taixi alike were bewildered.

Strange expressions now colored the faces of the cultivators. The most anxious among them wasn't Mingxiang, but Taixi—the horse-faced Maha was facing his mortal enemy. His face darkened as he cursed inwardly.

'What is Gongsun Bei doing?!'

He, Taixi, was giving his all, using his own body to suppress the Spiritual Treasure, his dharma power draining at a terrifying rate. Yet the dawn light between heaven and earth flashed again and again, the sands blew and blew, but the iridescent radiance just wouldn't descend!

Though all of this happened in the space of one or two breaths, in a battle of divine abilities, opportunities are fleeting. That slight delay was all it took; the chance to maneuver that Taixi had sealed off for Li Zhouwei had reappeared.

What was Gongsun Bei doing?

Li Zhouwei knew perfectly well. There was another object in the Great Void—the King Wei's Banner of Martial Governance in Ting Province, which he had acquired not long ago.

While the banner wasn't exceptionally powerful, it was an imperial standard bestowed by a emperor and possessed a certain unique quality. It had been standing silently in the Great Void, but now it sensed the threat and released surging waves of True Qi, an intertwining of water and fire that blocked Gongsun Bei's path.

Even though its primary function wasn't defense, and it was far inferior to a Spiritual Treasure, it couldn't withstand more than a few fierce attacks from the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm general. But by reflecting the Martial Cultivation Star in the sky, it was enough to delay him for an instant.

"SHRRIIIP…"

The sound from the Great Void was deafening. The bright light of True Qi flickered and rapidly shattered. A crimson battle-axe, shimmering with the light of sand and smoke, manifested its true form and clove through the radiance like a thunderbolt. The profound banner, with its violet-blue background and black-gold patterns, dimmed and fell listlessly back into the Great Void.

The general in gleaming armor finally appeared, his expression cold and solemn. He held the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform level in one hand and casually hefted the axe in the other. The scar on his face twisted as he stared down grimly.

'That profound banner resonates with the stars; it has some interesting properties. A silent ambush is no longer possible! I shouldn't move the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform rashly, lest I alert the prey and give him time to prepare... I'll pin him down first, then capture him in one fell swoop!'

Gongsun Bei had cultivated in the Zhao State for many years and had a profound understanding of the Buddhist cultivators' capacity for causing trouble. He wasn't surprised or even particularly disappointed. The conditions for using the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform weren't strict. If a surprise attack failed, it failed. He, Gongsun Bei, was more than enough to restrain Li Zhouwei on his own.

The general wasted no words. His five fingers spread, and the crimson axe vanished. He raised one hand to his chest, formed a seal, and pushed forward.

'Unending Dawnfire!'

A thick wave of dust and explosive light swept down, blanketing the entire battlefield. Faintly, it held the brilliance of a rising sun, a cold, deadly light that shone indiscriminately upon every cultivator present.

But Li Zhouwei's figure moved faster than the iridescent light. He had already broken through the obstacles, charging upward with his long halberd aimed directly at Taixi.

The horse-headed Maha's expression changed. As his opponent broke free, the Enlightened Artifacts in his hands suddenly became much harder to suppress. His heart sank into a bottomless abyss, but what added fuel to the fire was the dense azure light that now blazed in the sky.

"Who dares trespass on the soil of Song!"

A man in azure robes appeared, majestic and imposing. A scroll was tied to his waist, and a sword was strapped to his back. He strode forward on surging waves of Upright Wood light: Sima Yuanli!

This Daoist Master had clearly received news in advance and had just arrived. He didn't even have time to stop. His gaze swept the scene, and a look of apprehension appeared on his face. When he perceived the disturbance in the Great Void and Gongsun Bei's aggressive aura, the knot in his brow tightened.

'Just now, passing through Lixia, I saw Buddhist cultivators coming and going, their presence shaking the heavens. This is trouble…'

He was already on high alert, considering how to avoid getting entangled in this mess. But the opponent's divine ability had already struck. Sima Yuanli felt a searing heat on his face as his azure robes burst into flames.

'A Dawn Qi divine ability… Unending Dawnfire!'

Sima Yuanli recognized it clearly, which only confirmed the attacker's identity. And thanks to his family's legacy, he knew quite a bit about this particular art.

'Unending Dawnfire is the ancient 'Blazing Return'... It was originally established alongside the Three Yangs. But ever since the great powers deliberately inverted the Bright Yang, it has lost its blazing nature and now generates its own light!'

Seeing Gongsun Bei charge straight for Li Zhouwei, Sima Yuanli knew he had to intervene, no matter how little he understood the situation. He immediately retracted his own divine ability and raised an azure-green gourd: the Azure Grace Profound Gourd!

This treasure had been passed down through his family for generations. It was versatile, capable of manipulating both water and fire, and had a wide range of applications. The moment it was brought out, it performed a miracle.

He lifted the profound gourd, and yin and yang shifted. A grey, illusory light poured from its mouth as the Azure Radiance Pure Essence refined within was unleashed. It summoned a heaven-spanning torrent of dharma-water that first washed away Minghui's wondrous lotus rain before surging toward Gongsun Bei, cutting him off.

This scene did not escape Mingxiang's notice, causing him to frown in silence. Minghui, on the other hand, had a flash of brilliance in his eyes. If he didn't have to maintain his composure, he would have burst into tears of joy.

'You from the Sima Family… can't you ride the damn wind, or were you born without legs? What took you so long?'

'Sima Jun was late for the desert campaign, and you're late too? Dammit... it must be a family tradition! You nearly got your grandpa killed!'

Curses aside, Minghui had been saved from the brink. He found Sima Yuanli's presence quite welcome. On his face, however, he put on the classic greedy expression of a Buddhist cultivator, eyeing the Azure Radiance Pure Essence as he jeered.

"The Sima clan… showing their faces again today, are they!"

"CLANG!"

The resounding crash shook the heavens and scattered the clouds. While Minghui was enjoying his newfound freedom and putting on an act, the expression on Taixi's face had completely shattered. The Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl in his hands had reached its limit. Struck fiercely from within by the Pure Yang Bracelets, it was sent flying high into the air.

The Pure Yang Bracelets didn't have many offensive abilities. The first was Solar Bind, which could unleash a disorienting light to confuse the spiritual sense and vision. Even someone with a Life Divine Ability would be stunned for a moment. The second was Exalted Might, a simple strike whose power was linked to the number of the owner's Bright Yang divine abilities. The force was immense; even if one's golden body wasn't shattered, they would be knocked to the ground, temporarily immobilized.

This corroborated what Dongfang Lieyun had said about its origins. Furthermore, due to its unique material, the Spiritual Treasure possessed an innate quality of coming and going without a trace, its speed surpassing most other Spiritual Artifacts.

The Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl was airborne for only an instant, but the space beneath it was already empty. As Li Zhouwei's long halberd swept forward, the golden bracelets were already clasped around his own densely tattooed wrist.

'Gongsun Bei!'

Taixi roared in his heart, but as he met those blazing golden eyes, all his anger instantly turned to ice. He understood his opponent's predicament, and the resolve within it.

'Li Ximing isn't here. Sima Yuanli's arrival is helpful, but not by much. Gongsun Bei's position is exposed, but he holds a Spiritual Treasure and possesses three Dawn Qi divine abilities, making him extremely deadly. This entire assault was aimed at killing him. Based on the current situation, Mingxiang is a direct disciple of Jinlian from the Lotus Temple; his skills are profound. Even if Sima Yuanli, with his many treasures, can hold off Minghui, myself, and the Five-Eyed simultaneously, Li Zhouwei's chances against a combined attack from Gongsun Bei and Mingxiang are slim to none!'

'He needs to destroy my dharma body first, or at least wound me... only then might he have a chance to hold on in the fight to come. It's just like how he accepted a defensive position just to take out Chiluo first!'

His realization didn't come too late, but the thunder descending from afar had already pinned the jadeite skull in its original position. Before the man's long halberd even arrived, the radiance between his own brows had turned to darkness.

Emperor Qi's Light!

The Maha's glazed eyes reflected a deep color, mirroring the man at the other end of the bright halberd. The arms gripping the weapon were no longer covered by flowing, black robes with gold patterns, but by menacing armor with dark, gilded patterns.

Li Zhouwei, clad in armor and cloak, thrust his halberd forward!

The simple black robes were gone, replaced by a suit of sleek, black-and-gold armor. Every scale, etched with profound patterns, rippled with complex, flowing golden light, as if it were breathing. The pauldrons on his shoulders were a dark gold, emitting a dazzling, divine glow.

The vambraces were elegantly simple, marked only with the faint outline of a lunging qilin. Their smooth, dark-gold surface reflected on his hands, the light flowing down the halberd's shaft and scattering.

Outside the armor, the Campaign Cloak fluttered gently, making his shoulders seem broader. The tip of every Yuse feather was tinged with a faint purple, and its dark-gold patterns perfectly complemented the scales on his armor, creating a unified whole.

All the iridescent light poured into the long halberd. Li Zhouwei's eyes turned an almost brilliant, golden-white. Behind him, Gongsun Bei's Dawn Qi divine ability, Unending Dawnfire, descended, erupting in bursts of Dawn Qi flames on his Campaign Cloak. The Bright Yang radiance on him dimmed and flared, yet the young man seemed completely unaware.

At this moment, with Gongsun Bei's appearance, the power of Sovereign's Perilous Tread finally reached its peak, perfectly aligning with his fate and boosting his power by a terrifying ninety percent!

In an instant, a black-and-gold radiance submerged Taixi, plunging him into an endless darkness. But in the zenith above, a glorious scene of light had unfolded. A gleaming white Celestial Gate had risen.

Dragon banners and phoenix chariots danced and circled, a riot of color. Countless figures in golden armor floated in the sky, a stark contrast to the darkness enveloping him. But as the brilliant halberd descended, this expanse of light began to rapidly press in on the infinite darkness, falling toward Taixi's head.

'So, it was waiting here for me all along!'
