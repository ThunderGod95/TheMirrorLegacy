# Chapter 808: Merit Shelters and Dao Stipends

Li Jiangqian dispatched his men and waited in the main hall. Soon, a clamor arose outside, and a procession of figures quickly reached the entrance. They hesitated, shoving each other forward, but no one dared to enter.

With a creak...

Finally, Chen Donghe and An Siwei led the way into the Jade Court. Each was followed by three individuals holding real power within the Qingdu Jade Court. They bowed first. Li Jiangqian was quite respectful toward these two. He sat up straight and said:

"Elders, please come in first."

The hall doors swung shut, leaving only the two of them standing inside. Li Jiangqian pointed to the stacks of letters on his desk and said:

"There are twenty-two candidates for the clan's legacy shelter selection. Uncle Zhouluo granted each of them three types of protection: they can remain on the island, receive an official post along the periphery, and are given an annual stipend.

"Their every major and minor action over the last three years is documented here. Suspicions, evidence, reports suppressed by Uncle Zhouluo, and past stains found in the archives—all marked in vermilion.

"I need the two divisions to cooperate. Qingdu's forces are not to move. The Jade Court's men will go directly to 'invite' these people. Bring those invited to the hall and lock them in separate rooms. There is no need for interrogation and no need for torture."

Chen Donghe looked like he wanted to speak but stopped himself. An Siwei, however, bowed and offered a reminder:

"Patriarch, the clan has been relatively honest these past three years. Those chosen for the shelter selection are generally those without discernible faults. Even if some offenses were intentional, there's no handle for us to grasp. If we settle scores based on the distant past, I fear it will stir resentment."

"It doesn't matter."

Li Jiangqian smiled. "I only need you two elders to keep everyone under watch. We just need to tighten the atmosphere."

The two nodded in understanding. Li Jiangqian walked down from his seat and personally opened the main doors for them. As the doors swung open, the crowd of whispering figures kneeling outside immediately fell silent. Li Jiangqian smiled.

"One more thing. Please have the Qingdu Jade Court pass this message to all branches: If any sheltered family commits crimes or acts against Qingdu, when one person offends, the entire household will be implicated. Their shelter privileges will be reduced accordingly."

The crowd dispersed in an orderly fashion. Soon, people were being brought up the mountain one by one. Li Jiangqian waited a while before he saw a man in a patterned turban being dragged up the path. This was whom he had been waiting for. The smile vanished from Li Jiangqian's face, replaced by an icy glare.

Li Chengza's heart turned cold as ice.

The Jade Court Guard had shown up at his door in the dead of night, speaking of 'one person offending, the entire household implicated.' Li Chengza’s heart had skipped a beat.

What had his old man gone to do? Confess!

Li Xixuan had rushed back, diverting midway to Qingdu to plead for mercy. But Li Chengza didn't know this. He only knew his father had gone to plead his case and had not returned, though it was now the middle of the night. Earlier, he had been sitting worriedly with his brothers, speculating about where their father might be facing punishment...

Now, having been glared at like that by Li Jiangqian, he was terrified.

'Father always said the First Young Master was ruthless. This whole maneuver... he's going to strip my family of our shelter privileges. All five slots will be gone... He truly is a master strategist. Father walked right into his trap!'

He was dragged into a side courtyard and locked inside. The heavy door shut, plunging the room into darkness. A formation activated, sealing the courtyard off from the outside world, making communication impossible. His heart filled with despair. When a servant from the main hall came to offer tea, he didn't react at all.

"Sir, please..."

He turned his head slightly. Suddenly, he found the servant familiar. He paused, then asked:

"Are you from the Ren family?"

Li Xixuan's primary wife was from the Ren family, making the East Residence very close to them. He quickly grabbed the servant's hand, his rarely used mind spinning furiously. He stammered:

"Get a message... to the East Residence... tell them to split the family assets. Immediately! Save whatever can be saved..."

The Ren family servant glanced at him and replied:

"You overestimate me, Young Master. I am just a lowly servant; how could I have such influence? Besides, the moment you were taken away, the East Residence already split the family assets!"

Li Chengza went limp. He sat stunned for a long time before finally uttering a single word:

"Good."

While Li Chengza agonized inside, the outside was quiet, broken only by the sound of hurried footsteps. Moonlight flowed like water. Li Jiangqian stood at the hall entrance as Chen Yang bowed slightly and reported in a low voice:

"Patriarch, Lord Xixuan is still in the Qingdu courtyard. The East Residence has already frantically divided its assets. The west branch had already split, so there wasn't much movement there, save for two sub-branches that further divided..."

"That's enough."

Li Jiangqian said casually:

"By the time Clan Elder Xixuan comes down the mountain, he will have already lost his East Residence. His fractured descendants will blame him. The senior elders say resentment shouldn't be aimed at brothers or the main clan. Placing the blame squarely on our Clan Elder Xixuan is perfect."

He scoffed.

"When parents fail in their duties, the siblings unite against a common foe. Doesn't that make them more unified? It won't harm their relationships, and they certainly can't blame the clan... It was Li Xixuan who confessed his guilt first. Only then did I, Li Jiangqian, send men to arrest people. Now, the East Residence has exposed itself without any need for interrogation. The reason for all these arrests... everyone understands it now!"

Even Chen Yang felt a chill run down his spine. He paused for a moment before cupping his hands.

"I only fear he won't cooperate... Clan Elder Xixuan... understands the situation better than anyone. If he spreads the truth everywhere..."

"I am not afraid of him refusing to cooperate."

Li Jiangqian flicked his sleeves and strode back into the hall, clasping his hands behind his back. He laughed.

"A parent's love for their child requires planning for the distant future. What good does exposing the truth do the East Residence? It will only invite me to fracture and dismantle them time and time again. He is old. He doesn't dare openly oppose me now that I hold the power."

"Moreover..."

He reached the head seat, picked up his brush, and added:

"Is there any difference between pleading for mercy and admitting guilt? If he wasn't guilty, why would he need to plead?"

Li Jiangqian glanced at Chen Yang and continued,

"Go and fetch Cui Jueyin."

Chen Yang swept away like the wind. Cui Jueyin entered the hall shortly after, having clearly been waiting nearby for some time. Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"The matter we discussed these past two months, Lord Cui... has it come to fruition?"

Cui Jueyin bowed slightly and said respectfully:

"As instructed by the Patriarch, I have selected three foundational Daoist manuals from my family's collection of 667 Daoist scriptures. They are: the 'White Han Compilation' from the *Six Chapters on Seeking Immortality*; the 'Methods of Questioning Scaled Beasts' general record; and the 'Principles of Spiritual Talismans' general outline."

"The selected portions of these three paths have been redacted, expanded, and supplemented using several other traditions. They are now named the 'White Han,' the 'Questioning Methods,' and the 'Spiritual Talismans' volumes."

He presented three volumes with both hands. Their covers were white, gold, and purple respectively, etched with patterns that gave them a transcendent aura. Li Jiangqian accepted them, flipped through them twice, and nodded.

"I've troubled you, Senior."

Cui Jueyin stood aside. Li Jiangqian turned to Chen Yang, who was waiting below.

"Bring the clan members from the side courtyards."

Before long, the detainees filed in, one after another. They stood assembled below the platform, heads bowed in terror. Li Jiangqian smiled.

"First, congratulations are in order. Clan Elder Xixuan righteously came to the mountain to accept responsibility for his faults. The clan initiated an investigation. Fortunately, Uncle Zhouluo has a sharp eye, and his shelter selections were extremely accurate. Although there were some suspicious points, they have now all been clarified. The shelter selections stand."

The crowd below breathed a collective sigh of relief. They exchanged furtive glances, many of them looking toward Li Chengza.

Li Chengza was now certain his father had merely gone to confess. Thankfully, nothing concrete was found, otherwise his own household would have been despised. He celebrated silently as Li Jiangqian continued:

"I have called you all here today to discuss a truly important matter. I intend to open a new door of opportunity within the clan. Using Milin Mountain as the primary location, we will establish three paths of learning: 'White Han,' 'Questioning Methods,' and 'Spiritual Talismans.' These will be available for study by clan members on the island who cannot cultivate, allowing them to contribute their meager strength to the clan."

The crowd below looked up, confused, staring at the platform. Li Jiangqian smiled.

"In the future, the path of shelter selection will continue, but it will be reserved only for the descendants of cultivators who sacrificed themselves for the clan, and it will only shelter the single generation that possesses a spiritual aptitude. If their descendants lack this aptitude, their portion of the cultivator's assets will be temporarily recorded by the lake, waiting for a future descendant with aptitude to be born. This we will call a 'Merit Shelter.'

"As for the path of studying the Daoist scriptures: every five years, during the sacrificial rites, Milin Mountain will hold an examination. Those who demonstrate attainment in any of the three paths and pass a character assessment will be granted a 'Merit Stipend' position in the clan. Not only will they be permitted to reside on the main island, they will also receive rewards and a salary. This we will call a 'Dao Stipend.'"

The hall fell silent. Cui Jueyin, clearly prepared, retrieved several completed golden scrolls from his sleeve and passed them down to Chen Donghe and An Siwei.

Everyone knew the Li family's shelter selection was hardly ironclad. If one lacked ability, an appointed position could just as easily be revoked, and the rewards and residency rights lasted only one generation. If this Dao Stipend path was viable, wouldn't it be even better than the shelter selection?

Eyebrows raised in anticipation. Li Jiangqian continued:

"This path has three ranks of positions. The clan will also establish academies in the various prefectures, and graduates may even be dispatched off-island... Now, representatives from every branch, come forward and copy the scriptures."

He leaned back in his high seat. Below, the heated gazes of the crowd followed the three books. There were even a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators present; only with them leading the way did the others obediently form a queue to copy the texts. Li Jiangqian's gaze drifted over the ecstatic faces.

'I can never allow them to easily attain positions of authority... Only by channeling their energy into the endless annotations of these Daoist scriptures, forcing them to spend their lives poring over the texts until their hair turns white, will they have no ambition left to study other matters. Only then can they slowly climb this new power structure, one that is completely isolated from the sixteen prefectures, the two peaks, and the mountain. This is the only way to prevent future trouble...'

He maintained his smile. As the copying finished, amidst the cacophony of voices crying out gratitude for the Patriarch's immense grace, he looked up slightly.

'Besides, it's not without its benefits... Reading these scriptures extensively will also serve to educate their descendants... Children with spiritual aptitude will use these three books for their enlightenment. It might even aid their future cultivation.'

"This is the law of Merit Shelters and Dao Stipends!"

...

Night deepened. Stars glittered in the sky, and the vast sea was calm, unbroken by waves. Gulls and eagles soared. A few cries echoed from the distant horizon, fading quickly from hearing.

A cool breeze rustled the maple forest. White jade lotus lamps floated on the stream, while the cyan jade platform glowed with a pure, bright light. A cultivator in white-gold Daoist robes opened his eyes. Profound Light flashed into existence, and a purple fire flared before dissipating, illuminating the woods for an instant.

Li Ximing had spent this recent period cultivating in the forest. The injuries to his dharma body had fully healed. This cultivation abode, cleared for him by the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain, was clearly exceptional; its spiritual energy was comparable to that of Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Uniquely, white jade lotus lamps drifted down the stream, lit within by some sort of spiritual item aspected to Valley Water that aided healing. The fragrance was rich. Although it had little effect on injuries at Li Ximing's Purple Mansion Realm level, the thought behind it was clear.

'My progress on the "Audience with the Celestial Gate" divine ability hasn't been great. Although I walked the line between life and death, and my Dao insight improved slightly, my cultivation base stagnated while I was healing...'

Refining a divine ability was a slow, grinding process. Li Ximing estimated it would take him another thirty-odd years to perfect Audience with the Celestial Gate. He calculated inwardly:

"By Jiangnan standards, my cultivation talent isn't actually slow. Perfecting this in thirty-plus years means I can immediately connect it to the *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass*. Without needing a transitional technique, I can spend another ten-odd years forging the Dao foundation, and then I can begin refining 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread.'

"I haven't seen any records regarding the time it takes to break through to the second divine ability; it must depend heavily on personal talent. Lacking the experience, it's hard to estimate. Let's budget ten years. That means achieving 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' in sixty years. If everything goes smoothly, I can condense the third divine ability in one hundred twenty years, break through to the mid-stage, and face the Purple Mystery Threshold."

The Purple Mystery Threshold was notoriously difficult, so Li Ximing couldn't estimate beyond it. Once he had three divine abilities, he would be considered a core powerhouse among Jiangnan's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Li Zhouwei wouldn't be much slower than him. At that point, even if they faced Changxiao, they wouldn't be completely outmatched.

"The only difficulty is surviving these next one hundred twenty years while being targeted by Changxiao. That is no easy task."

Li Ximing's situation was awkward. If he returned to Jiangnan, he had no confidence he could face Changxiao's overt attacks and hidden schemes. But if he remained overseas, his family wasn't safe either.

"Although Zhouwei took a huge risk and eliminated Situ Mo, ending our family's century-long affliction and removing a critical blade pointed at us, once Changxiao returns to Jiangnan and begins to scheme... even if he can't find another operative like Situ Mo, there will certainly be no shortage of borrowed blades..."

He felt a pang of frustration. Suddenly, the wind chimes in the maple trees tinkled. Xia Shouyu, dressed in white, emerged from the woods. She bowed slightly and spoke with great respect:

"Reporting to the Daoist Master: the two Daoist Masters have sent word. They say the matter discussed previously is ready, and we can set out."

Xia Shouyu had spent the better part of the last year on Nine Mounds, and her life wasn't just comfortable; it was luxurious compared to her entire life before. Never mind the density of spiritual energy in her dwelling; even the most desolate spot on a mountain path here had spiritual energy several times thicker than at Qingxu Temple.

Living this well, the woman positively glowed. Adorned with a few magical artifact accessories, she appeared even more beautiful. Her naturally thin eyebrows, which gave her a slightly severe look, were now offset by a pendant worn on her brow. Xia Shouyu had always known how to carry herself; now, she truly looked like a direct disciple from a major Purple Mansion Realm sect.

Li Ximing wasn't a cruel person and didn't find her appearance excessive. Seeing the once-rustic woman transform like this merely made him nod with a smile. He rose, tucking his hands into his sleeves as a thought occurred to him:

'I can use this opportunity... I should ask Houfu to take her to the lake. It's both safe and convenient, and it sends a subtle message of deterrence... Zhouming isn't getting any younger, yet he drifts aimlessly day after day. He's probably still frequenting some pleasure barge. That won't do.'

Thus, as he walked out, he asked:

"Lingdu is a generous elder. I hear that while your status on the immortal mountain is that of a guest, your actual treatment is akin to an outer disciple, with several scripture repositories open to you... is that correct?"

Xia Shouyu immediately panicked, rushing to say:

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, yes, that is true! But the artifacts and clothes this junior wears were all exchanged using the cultivation resources the Daoist Master granted me. I have not taken a single thing from the Nine Mounds tradition..."

Xia Shouyu had a meticulous mind and had already thought several steps ahead. But Li Ximing wasn't concerned about that. He nodded slightly.

"You've done well. I will find an opportunity to secure a better background for you, but you must be worthy of it. Since the scripture repositories are open to you, spend these next days reading more."

Xia Shouyu was both shocked and overjoyed. Although her talent, appearance, and intellect were second to none, her lowly birth was a constant source of hidden insecurity. Tears welled in her eyes.

"The Daoist Master's grace is like a second life! Even if I am crushed to dust, I cannot repay it!"

Li Ximing walked ahead, hands clasped behind his back, nodding slightly.

"Use these days to read. Otherwise, when opportunity is handed to you, you won't be able to hold it steady. If you are exposed later and regret it then, it will be far too late."

Xia Shouyu nodded repeatedly. The two arrived beneath the large maple tree where the discussion had been held earlier. Houfu, dressed in shamanic robes, and the elderly Lingdu were conferring in low voices. Seeing Li Ximing approach, Lingdu rose to his feet and said in an aged voice:

"Greetings, Daoist Friend Zhaojing. Time is short. Please, let us depart together."

Li Ximing nodded. Houfu merely offered a greeting and fell silent again. The three of them pierced the Great Void, and infinite blackness enveloped them. Only then did Lingdu speak softly:

"Daoist Friend Houfu and I have been setting this up for days. We wanted to be thorough and minimize the disturbance, which is why we delayed. However, we received news the day before yesterday. The Merciful One who went to the Buddhist Land to report has already walked the mountain of blades and sea of fire. He completed his punishment but was not demoted. Instead, he has returned under orders to continue the investigation. We had no choice but to hastily ask you to come."

Li Ximing shook his head.

"What can he possibly find? Anything that could be divined should have been divined long ago. If any traces had been found, they would have already pursued them. He wouldn't have needed to go to Buddhist Land to accept punishment in the first place."

He said this, but Li Ximing still felt a little apprehensive.

'This is a huge operation. I just hope that fellow doesn't come back bearing a grudge and pin everything on me... We need to finish this as quickly as possible.'

Lingdu seemed to share this sentiment. He didn't travel directly through the Great Void. Instead, he detoured to the Mortal Sea, utilizing its extremely fast transit properties to quickly arrive north of the Peacock Sea. He then retrieved a lotus flower from his sleeve.

The flower was a lovely pink, no bigger than his palm. On an adjacent stalk hung an old seed pod. Li Ximing stood beside him and could see clearly that the pod had exactly five neat holes.

Lingdu formed a hand seal, and three of the five holes immediately responded. Three jade-white lotus seeds popped out. The old Daoist Master said in a low voice:

"Please, both of you take one. Press it against the web of your thumb and hold it there. This will guard against Maha divination!"

'You had something this good and didn't mention it? You should have said so earlier...'

Li Ximing relaxed slightly. He pressed the seed into his hand as instructed and felt a strange sensation cover his dharma body, an indistinct five-colored treasured light. Following Lingdu, he exited the Great Void and found himself on the seabed somewhere within the Peacock Sea.

This area was dark and lightless. The seawater was a deep bronze-green. Li Ximing descended with the other two, quickly arriving at a massive undersea canyon. Lingdu said:

"Please wait here a moment!"

The old man vanished into the depths of the canyon. Although Li Ximing knew the probability of them harming him was almost zero, his heart still pounded nervously.

'If they set up a formation here and attacked me together, my life would be in grave danger... If I don't use the Profound Light... there is a sixty percent chance I will fall here...'

Fortunately, his fears did not materialize. After only half an incense stick of time, the seafloor began to tremble, and the entire seabed shook violently.

*BOOM!*

A brilliant, five-colored pillar of treasured light, as large as a house, erupted from the seabed. It surged through the heavy seawater, aiming for the sky. Houfu, who had been silently forming seals and chanting, finally stopped and barked:

"Rise!"

A small, patterned brown pouch flew from his sleeve, darting through the water to intercept the radiant light pillar mid-journey. The mouth of the bag pulsed. The five-colored light, which had been surging upward, bent its trajectory. It traveled several more li before turning just shy of the surface, diverting neatly into the bag's opening.

Suppressing such an anomaly was not easy. Even though the treasured light didn't pierce the heavens, auspicious clouds still gathered above the ocean surface. Li Ximing knew his part. He didn't use his own divine abilities or magic; instead, he activated the treasure pearl in his hand. The [Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger] lit up, and several beams of Earth-elemental radiance shot toward the sky, scattering the clouds.

Houfu's brow furrowed tightly. While maintaining control of the brown pouch with one hand, he looked at Li Ximing and warned in a low voice:

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, be warned. The Peacock Merciful One can sense this item. Although we are suppressing it, the Peacock Sea is right here. That Merciful One will certainly ride the winds to investigate."

Li Ximing nodded curtly. After a few breaths, the pillar of light finally subsided, and Houfu looked visibly more relaxed. Just then, however, a sound-shattering screech echoed from the horizon:

"CAW—!"

A colossal beast surfaced on the ocean—a mix of five-colors and bronze. It had red eyes, a golden beak, and was the size of a small mountain, with a broad, flat back. The streaking light of its wake flowed with multicolored, treasured hues, instantly dyeing half the sky.

The peacock leaped lightly, breached the sea, and plunged straight toward their location, its voice a deep, resonant male tone:

"Who dares steal from my Peacock lineage!"

The Merciful One arrived in an instant, transforming underwater into a middle-aged monk draped in five-colored robes. He had six ordination scars on his scalp, each a different color. His hands were empty, and his eyes were wide with fury.

Li Ximing glanced at Houfu. The Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Monastery seemed immensely pleased by the monk's appearance. He laughed aloud and replied:

"Your father."

The middle-aged monk snapped his gaze toward the voice and froze, terror seizing his heart.

'Purple Mansion Realm?! Two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!'

A Merciful One was only about the level of an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Even if they cultivated the Lotus Seat, it primarily boosted survivability, not raw power. At best, he could fight a cultivator with two divine abilities. Typically, it took three to five Merciful Ones to resist a cultivator who had passed the Purple Mystery Threshold...

Seeing two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators at once terrified him. Furthermore, Li Ximing and Houfu had concealed their auras, revealing nothing of their divine ability cultivation, which made him completely unable to gauge their depth. Still, he was a Peacock, a Merciful One of the great Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour. His confidence remained. He spoke in a cold voice:

"I wonder which lineage these Daoist Masters hail from? Do you not know that the Peacock Sea is the territory of the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour? This treasured light also belongs to my Peacock lineage. Please hand it over immediately..."

"The Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour has four Merciful Ones in total, and they are rushing here now. Daoist friends, do not bring disaster upon yourselves!"

Li Ximing's Bright Yang divine ability was not suited for concealing his aura, and he had no idea what the Merciful One's divination capabilities were, so he remained silent. Houfu, however, burst into wild laughter, looking completely unrestrained as he answered coldly:

"I won't bother changing my name! I am Daoist Master Buzi of the Supreme Yang Azure Pond Sect! Now get lost!"

Li Ximing stared, stunned. He nearly turned his head to look at him, muttering inwardly:

'Wait... Houfu... you... huh?'
