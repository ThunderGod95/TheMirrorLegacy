# Chapter 968: Wan Xue

Si Yuanli!

The man before them was none other than Si Yuanli, who had been in seclusion for many years seeking to attain a divine ability!

The Si Family had a long and profound heritage. Si Boxiu was a Great Daoist Master, a figure who suppressed entire regions, and he possessed numerous methods. He had also obtained the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill in Anhuai Heaven and made many preparations. Now, Si Yuanli’s divine ability was complete. Vibrant and full of spirit, he had clearly reached the Purple Mansion Realm!

He beamed, the very picture of high spirits. The scroll at his waist looked ordinary, yet a faint radiance flowed from it, making it difficult to look at directly.

“Lin Wuning… Where is Daoist Friend Ning?”

Lin Wuning remained kneeling, not daring to raise his head. He trembled like a leaf in the wind, stammering for a long time without managing to form a single sentence. He even forgot the proper honorifics, only managing to force out,

“Daoist Master… in seclusion…”

Although Qin Xian stood respectfully in place, his presence was far stronger. He looked down on Lin Wuning with a cold sneer in his heart.

'With no Daoist Master to back you up, and now that Li Yuanqin is gone… what does that make you, Lin Wuning! You’ve been pampered since childhood, a good-for-nothing placeholder!'

While Li Yuanqin was a member of the Ning family, he had real ability and influence. In terms of seniority, he was even the young uncle of the Li family's current Daoist Master. If Li Yuanqin had taken the position of Sect Master, Qin Xian wouldn't have said a word and would have certainly offered his reminders respectfully. But in his eyes, Lin Wuning was merely a fortunate opportunist, and he refused to give him even a shred of courtesy.

Seeing this pathetic display, even Si Yuanli frowned. This was, after all, the Sect Master appointed by the Ning family.

“Is there truly no one left in the sect!” he said.

Lin Wuning endured the humiliation, forcing a subservient smile as he respectfully moved to one side. Si Yuanli’s expression turned sorrowful. He turned his head slightly and saw a figure rushing frantically up the steps, dropping to his knees before the platform. The man was weeping with joy, crying out,

“Congratulations, Daoist Master… Congratulations…”

Si Yuanli glanced over and recognized Si Tongyi. Kneeling beside him was a handsome and spirited youth, his joy equally uncontrollable. It was Li Xizhi's youngest disciple, Si Xunhui.

Si Yuanli smiled.

“That you two are still here is truly my greatest joy!”

Both men laughed joyfully, and the hall instantly filled with a lively atmosphere. Si Yuanli walked into the hall as if he owned the place and sat in the main seat. Qin Xian dutifully served him hot tea. Si Yuanli took a long, satisfying sip, only to see Si Tongyi present a jade pendant with a somber expression.

“The Old Ancestor left this jade pendant before he passed. He said it holds a few words for you, Daoist Master. None of us have been able to open it…”

Si Yuanli’s eyes immediately reddened. He took the pendant as if it were a priceless treasure, his hands trembling. Closing his eyes, he listened for a moment before hot tears streamed down his face.

“Among all the Purple Mansion Realm masters, only the Great Master’s affairs were left in perfect order… He wasn't selfish and scrambling at the last minute like Changxi. He wasn't full of resentment with a dark, cruel personality like Yuansu. And he certainly wasn't tyrannical like Yuanwu… Without the Old Ancestor's many treasures and preparations, how could I have possibly attained my divine ability today…”

The Si family members on both sides were visibly moved. Although Qin Xian felt absolutely no emotional connection to Daoist Master Yuanxiu, he managed to squeeze out a few tears as well. Si Yuanli, however, had received a clue from the jade pendant's message.

“Where is Daoist Master Ning?” he asked urgently.

Si Tongyi took a step back, knelt, and replied, “Daoist Master Ning used a secret technique in the north to kill a demonic cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm. It's said she left a million corpses in her wake. She went into seclusion immediately after and hasn't been seen since… It seems she is not in the Pristine Pool. Even Lin Wuning doesn't know her whereabouts.”

“Oh?”

Si Yuanli set his cup down. As he listened to Si Tongyi recount the events of the past, the more he heard, the more uneasy he became. His expression gradually turned grave.

“Kui Qi has fallen? And the two gates are sealed?”

“Qi Lanyan? And Profound Peak’s Kong Tingyun!”

He looked up, hesitant. In the years he had been in seclusion, the world outside had been turned upside down. Counting through the names, there was no one left for him to even visit.

“How did things reach such a state.”

He pondered for a long time, a chill creeping into his heart.

'What kind of technique is this? The Pristine Water overflowing, a million corpses… Is that truly a divine ability that Ning Wan possesses? And why has she disappeared? This isn't right… There is definitely a problem!'

Si Yuanli was not a simple man. He secretly sensed that something was amiss and asked,

“Has Li Zhouwei achieved the Dao?”

“Yes…” Si Tongyi replied cautiously.

“He has achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, and his Daoist Title is Minghuang. We hear he excels in combat. He has clashed with the northern cultivators several times, and although his divine ability is not as profound, he has not been at a disadvantage in the slightest!”

A smile immediately touched Si Yuanli’s lips. He looked kindly at Si Xunhui, who was standing to the side.

“And how is your Master?”

Si Xunhui replied joyfully, “Master is cultivating in the Eastern Sea, currently seeking an opportunity to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!”

Although Si Xunhui was young, he was not shallow. As Li Xizhi’s disciple, his identity was complex; he could even count the Li family as his backing. He was the only one in the Si family who was, from the bottom of his heart, friendly toward the Li family.

Unlike his two disciple-brothers, who felt a need to look after Li Zhouluo, Si Xunhui understood that while he felt affection for his Master and his Master's descendants, affection was one thing; the family he truly needed to align with was the Li family. Li Zhouluo was merely a stepping stone. His past actions—secretly revealing information, cultivating a friendship with Li Wushao, and even intentionally finding reasons to rest at the Li family estate—were all for this single purpose.

By reading Si Yuanli's expression, he understood that the Daoist Master needed something from the Li family. His heart began to pound with anticipation.

'This must be my ladder to success! If the Si and Li families can maintain a long-term friendship, I will undoubtedly be the one who benefits the most…'

Si Yuanli’s expression was grim. He remained silent for a long time, his mind racing.

'The Great Master has left and his whereabouts are unknown. The Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour has lost one Peacock after another in recent years, and everyone in the Peacock Sea is living in fear… I never expected the mainland to be in such chaos as well…'

'The Old Ancestor's instructions… He said that if I successfully reached the Purple Mansion Realm, first, I must absolutely not get involved in the mess of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Second, I must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the Yang family's affairs. I am to protect myself on the mainland, observe the changing situation, preserve the clan, and seek the True Law of Wood. Perhaps he was referring to this very situation.'

Although Si Yuanli had been in seclusion for many years, his Old Ancestor had left him a great deal. Among the Three Yuans, Daoist Master Yuanxiu had possessed the highest cultivation and the most illustrious background. In the latter half of his life, his outstanding divine ability and mastery of talisman arts had allowed him to amass an immense fortune. Si Yuanli had inherited it all… an inheritance that likely surpassed even Ning Wan’s by a wide margin!

Now, after just a brief assessment and asking about a few names, he began to scheme.

“The Qi family… They were also a great family back in the Zhou era and had some connections with my family. But times have changed… Back then, everyone followed the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition… What a pity!”

He stroked his beard, his mind deep in thought.

'Now Li Zhouwei has also succeeded… It was his time. This was bound to happen, ever since Li Ximing first broke through.'

His expression was heavy as his gaze swept across the hall. He gradually came to a realization.

'Even though I've returned, I absolutely cannot be tied down to the Azure Pond. I can't find Ning Wan, but the Li family is still here. I should go and ask them for clarity. The Old Ancestor mentioned he left a favor with the Li family, and even a spiritual item of Pure Qi. The time to use it should be now…'

He took a sip of tea and glanced at Qin Xian, who was still kneeling to the side.

'It's no wonder Lin Wuning is so useless. Ning Wan must have treated the Azure Pond like a hot potato she couldn't wait to discard… Good, good. We cultivated a useful pawn long ago, so our own family's disciples don't have to get their hands dirty.'

It wasn't that Lin Wuning absolutely had to be replaced. But Si Yuanli intended to consolidate the Azure Pond, use it to handsomely enrich his own disciples, and cultivate a few trusted confidants. He naturally couldn't leave such a mediocre person in charge.

He looked over with a smile, lifted his chin, and said, “Guest Retainer Qin, go and take over Lin Wuning’s duties.”

Qin Xian’s body shook. He looked completely unprepared, even finding it hard to believe. He had assumed the position of Sect Master would inevitably go to Si Tongyi, and he would be lucky to get some scraps. How could he have landed such a position? His mouth went dry.

“This… how can this be…”

He secretly glanced at Si Tongyi, only to see Si Tongyi smile and say,

“With Guest Retainer Qin handling matters… everyone can rest assured!”

Seeing Si Tongyi’s smile, Qin Xian was instantly overjoyed. He declared with conviction, “I will definitely serve the Daoist Master to the death!”

Si Tongyi didn't know Si Yuanli's true intentions, nor was he completely without desire for the Sect Master position. But with his own family elder having become a Daoist Master, and being the only junior present, his position was already secure as a mountain. Why would he need to fight for this? He smiled and saw Qin Xian out, then returned.

He saw Si Yuanli say leisurely, “The younger disciples should not hold any positions in the sect. Find a few excuses and send them all to the Southern Sea. Prepare to extricate ourselves from the situation.”

“Yes…” Si Tongyi was secretly alarmed but agreed. As he was about to leave, Si Yuanli called him back.

He pondered for a long time before instructing, “Send a man to the Li family…”

He hesitated slightly, then his gaze shifted to Si Xunhui. As if having made a decision, his tone changed, and he looked at Si Xunhui with a smile.

“Xunhui, you will accompany me to the Li family!”

Si Xunhui smiled and agreed, careful not to show off how close he was to the Li family in front of Si Yuanli. He simply replied obediently,

“Reporting to the Daoist Master… this junior believes we should first send word of my Daoist Master's title…”

Si Yuanli stroked his beard and smiled. “Ning Wan didn't play by the Azure Pond’s rules, so I don't need to either. We'll just call it… ‘Azure-Flash’!”

Both men acknowledged the name. A look of extremely deep sorrow flashed across Si Yuanli’s face. He sighed heavily.

“But before that, there is one more thing to do… I heard the Old Ancestor failed his breakthrough in the Southern Sea. I must go to the Southern Sea to pay my respects, and then return to the clan's cenotaph to report the good news to him!”

...

“The Eastern Sea… Wave-Suppressing Mansion…”

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain, white flowers bloomed everywhere. A Daoist Master sat at a table, wreathed in bright light and True Fire, delicately sipping his tea. Another, taller man stood nearby, clad in armor with his hands behind his back.

Li Que'wan knelt to one side, looking somewhat surprised.

“I obey the two Daoist Masters' decree…”

Li Ximing just smiled. “The spiritual energy there isn't bad. They are all doing this for your own good.”

Li Que'wan replied hastily, “This junior did not mean to imply otherwise! It’s just that… if this junior goes to cultivate in peace, all the family's affairs will trouble my brothers.”

Li Ximing shook his head with a laugh, but Li Que'wan continued, “This junior has another matter to report.”

“Oh?” Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

Li Que'wan reported, “This junior went to the Wilderness a few days ago, intending to see my younger brothers before I enter seclusion. However, while I was calculating the spiritual energy, I detected several fluctuations. My calculations were wrong multiple times, and my Immortal Foundation issued a warning that a hidden seal was quietly being undone. I fear a major change is imminent.”

“The Wilderness?”

Li Ximing’s first reaction was naturally the Wanling Heaven across the river, but hearing it was in the Wilderness, he felt a flicker of suspicion. Li Zhouwei had already turned his head, a contemplative look on his face.

Li Ximing understood immediately.

'If Que'wan discovered an anomaly, she must have used an Immortal Artifact to investigate. She must have seen some clue that she cannot easily speak of, but she is certain of her findings.'

He exchanged a glance with Li Zhouwei, and together they stepped into the Great Void. Within moments, they had arrived in the Great Void above the Wilderness.

Li Zhouwei scanned the area, his divine ability brushing over the land. He nodded thoughtfully.

“There is indeed an anomaly!”

Li Ximing’s illusion-breaking arts were far inferior to Li Zhouwei’s, but he had already invoked a law and swept his gaze across the area. The world seemed to clear, and far below in the darkness, a faint, illusory white light appeared, undulating like ripples on water.

Although he had never seen this specific color, it felt familiar. Li Ximing’s heart skipped a beat.

“A formation?”

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly. The two descended deeper into the Great Void, following a spiritual meridian downward. As they went, the fluctuations in the Great Void grew more intense. Soon, they saw a mass of gentle white light, pulsing violently.

Li Ximing extended his senses. The Great Void here corresponded to an ice-cave deep underground. It was pitch-black, filled with a biting chill, and covered in ice crystals. The Baleful Earth qi was incredibly dense.

“So there’s a space deep underground…”

Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes slowly swept the area. Suddenly, he heard his uncle’s voice, transmitted grimly via divine ability,

“Someone is here.”

Sure enough, a woman in white stood within the ice-cave.

Her hair was unbound, cascading freely. She had bright eyes and a fine nose, a face of extreme beauty. Her skin was like new-fallen snow, her aura like frost—a chilling purity that assaulted the senses. She stood ethereally in the cold, looking as if she were condensed from a blizzard, wreathed in a biting, glacial wind.

Cultivating Cold Qi was known to enhance one's appearance and temperament, and her beauty was truly exquisite. It was a coldness that perfectly matched the elegance of an eastern woman, so striking it made one forget the mortal world.

Li Ximing had seen countless beautiful women in his life, but his first glance at her still left him stunned. But then, the intense radiance of divine ability flooded his vision, and in the next instant, his heart seized.

Four distinct divine abilities formed of Cold Qi were coalesced around her body, coiling and spinning with terrifying power.

He was inwardly aghast. 'A Great Daoist Master of the Cold Qi path?'

Many people in the world cultivated Cold Qi, but there were few Great Daoist Masters among them. In the next moment, Li Ximing knew exactly who she was.

Tianwan!

'Daoist Master Tianwan from Crimson Reef Island!'

At that very same instant, Tianwan, who had been meditating with her eyes closed, slowly opened them. She looked up, and her gaze seemed to pierce straight through the Great Void, landing upon the two men like falling snow.

Decades had passed, but her face had not changed in the slightest. The only difference was that the divine ability she had just crossed the immortal threshold to attain back then was now perfected, coiling around her like a raging blizzard.

Daoist Master Tianwan cultivated Cold Qi. Although the Cold Qi path had its flaws and she was not known for her combat prowess, she was still a Great Daoist Master. Her current strength might not compare to Changxiao or Wei Xuanyin, but she could handle an ordinary mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm master with no problem at all.

And Crimson Reef Island and the Li family had a deep-seated grudge, almost a generational feud. Seeing Tianwan in this place, at this time, sent a chill straight down Li Ximing’s spine.

'Tianwan… is actually here… And from the looks of it, this isn't her first or second day!'

Li Ximing glanced at the ice-cave and already understood the situation.

There could only be a Great Void connection where spiritual energy existed. This place should have been sealed off from all spiritual energy to prevent detection by Purple Mansion Realm masters. Tianwan must have used some unknown method to find this place and has been silently guarding it, apparently waiting for something.

However, due to the violent changes within and the external pull of Wanling Heaven's impending descent, a trace of spiritual energy had begun to leak out, connecting with the spiritual energy of the outside world. The disturbance was minuscule, and it was deep underground. Tianwan had done her best to suppress it, so no one had noticed…

…Except that the Li family was situated right next door and had been developing the Wilderness for many years. Furthermore, Li Que'wan had achieved Awaiting the supreme divine and cultivated shamanic arts, giving her perceptive abilities on par with a Purple Mansion Realm master. This was the only reason she had detected the subtle change.

Anyone else who sensed it would likely have dismissed it as an illusion. But Li Que'wan possessed an immortal artifact for dark probing, which allowed her to confirm her suspicions, giving her the confidence to report it to them.

But Tianwan, standing quietly in the ice-cave, showed no surprise. Nor did she radiate much hostility. She simply spoke, her voice soft,

“I knew you two Daoist friends would come sooner or later. Please, join me inside.”

Li Ximing hesitated, looking to Li Zhouwei. He saw his nephew frowning slightly as he sent a message with his divine ability,

'I fear this is about the Hongxue Gate.'
