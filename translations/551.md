# Chapter 843: The Scheme Of Golden Feather Sect

Great Ning Palace.

Li Xuanfeng adjusted his breath mid-air for a while, while Si Yuanli stood with his sword in hand. He kept one arm behind his back as he silently gazed at the crystalline pillar of light that pierced the heavens and earth.

The Dao lineage of Ning State is renowned for its use of True Essence, often in conjunction with talismanic arts, with many cultivators practicing talismans and shamanic paths. Anhuai Heaven has never been opened before, so there must be quite a few treasures inside.

He was in no hurry. The grotto heaven was vast, and many formations remained intact. It was far beyond what Great Ning Palace could compare to. Being early or late by fifteen minutes didn’t matter.

Si Yuanli was still in thought, when suddenly the world seemed to dim slightly. The crystalline light pillar flickered faintly. He furrowed his brows, but everything quickly returned to normal.

“Hmm?”

Suddenly, a golden glow faintly lit up the sky. Si Yuanli froze in surprise. Glancing down, he saw the clear lake surface rolling with waves of white mist as tiny lotus flowers burst forth and rapidly bloomed in full.

“This...”

As he stood dazed, endless pink lotus blossoms crowded and collided across the lake’s surface. Auspicious heavenly glow rose at the horizon. Only then did Si Yuanli belatedly lift his head.

The sky was now filled with boundless gold, as fine golden dust fell like sand. An enormous celestial figure was now reflected in his pupils. A majestic yet benevolent golden face filled nearly the entire sky, breaking through the clouds as if the heavens themselves had collapsed. Its eyes, shimmering with golden lacquer, slowly descended into Great Ning Palace.

“Maha...!?” Si Yuanli cried out in pain, hurriedly shutting his eyes. Crimson tears of blood welled at the corners of his eyes and streamed down his cheeks. His heart was filled with terror and shock as he said, “Have I gone mad!?”

Li Xuanfeng opened his eyes at almost the same moment. A muffled boom like thunder rang out, golden-white light flashed, and Si Yuanli coughed up a mouthful of blood.

He screwed his eyes shut and clutched at his chest with one hand as he forced out a whisper. “Honored Daoist Masters...”

The sky burst into a kaleidoscope of color. Yellow, orange, red, and purple filled the sky. Hazy halos bloomed one after another as vague flames surged forth. Silhouettes descended in quick succession, and in the blink of an eye, a slender hand reached out and a white-clothed woman stepped through.

Splash...

She had just flown into the air when a misty white rain began to fall, delicate and ethereal. It was quite beautiful.

But the two had no mind to admire it. As the white rain brushed past them, the spirit wind beneath Li Xuanfeng's feet vanished like winter snow. His footing gave way, and when he instinctively tried to summon mana, not a trace of spirit wind responded.

It’s the Water Mansion... thought Li Xuanfeng.

He crashed onto the stone platform, shattering the tiles beneath him. Si Yuanli fared even worse, slamming down beside him with a heavy thud, his face flushing red.

Li Xuanfeng looked up, but the white-clothed woman had already vanished. They had been merely brushed by her divine ability, but the wind beneath their feet had been entirely dispersed, leaving them momentarily unable to fly.

Si Yuanli struggled twice before he managed to rise. His eyes were still shut, blood pouring out in streams, dripping down his cheeks as he murmured, “Brother Xuanfeng! They’ve all made their move...”

The radiant lights overhead surged toward the central cliff, painting the sky with strange phenomena. Li Xuanfeng watched Si Yuanli take out a jade vial and drop two drops into each eye before finally opening them slightly.

Li Xuanfeng felt the tremors underfoot and rose to his feet. “There’s likely going to be trouble inside Anhuai Heaven.”

Si Yuanli chuckled twice and muttered, “Trouble? This is beyond that... we should be thankful just to be alive...”

He hadn’t even finished speaking when another bearded immortal streaked across the sky. Torrents of True Flame surged through the air, evaporating swathes of lakewater and sending fiery sparks scattering. Si Yuanli was forced to shut his mouth, raise his hands, and summon mana to defend himself. His face was twisted from the heat, and his palms sizzled audibly.

Even the dullest among them could now see that there was no sense in heading for Anhuai Heaven anymore. They would likely be burned to ashes by True Flame or have their bodies eroded by Water Mansion. It would be an end without a corpse or soul.

As for the majority of cultivators who had already entered, they could only pray their sect’s Daoist Masters were inside as well. Otherwise, no one even needed to target them. Just standing in the grotto heaven would be enough, for not even a trace of their true soul would remain in a few moments.

“So this is why we weren’t supposed to enter...”

Si Yuanli had only glimpsed a Maha unleash his full power, and been grazed by the divine abilities of a few other Daoist Masters. He was already bleeding profusely and gravely injured. The flesh of both his palms were sizzling as they tried to fight the searing True Flame, yet he still gritted his teeth in bitter relief, “Thank goodness... thank goodness we rested beforehand...”

Li Xuanfeng also endured the searing True Flame with gritted teeth. Though he and Si Yuanli had narrowly escaped disaster, his expression remained grim as he asked in a deep voice, “Brother Yuanli! This is no time for relief! How do we get out of Great Ning Palace?”

“Out of Great Ning Palace?” Si Yuanli wiped the blood from his face and shook his head. “Without a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to receive us, you and I will die trapped in this damned place!”

As expected...

Li Xuanfeng’s heart sank. Si Yuanli lowered his voice and said, “We must hide quickly... You have the Huai River Map. If things truly become dire, unfurl it. It should preserve your life!”

He stabbed his longsword into the ground. One palm pressed flat against the hilt, he tapped the balde with the fingers of his other hand as he intoned, “Complete Yuan Escape Spell, seek aid from the Nether World!”

The sword immediately radiated with light. The ground beneath them split open wide before Li Xuanfeng’s eyes. Si Yuanli gave a slight nod and began burrowing into the earth.

Li Xuanfeng let the spell art guide him. After sinking for roughly fifteen minutes, they finally reached the bottom. Pitch-black stone walls appeared around him; it was an enclosed chamber no larger than a small hut, with neatly squared stone surfaces.

He suddenly noticed Si Yuanli looked shorter. Upon closer inspection, he saw that Si Yuanli’s lower body was still embedded in the stone. His face was pale, with a stream of mana held tightly in his chest.

Boom!

Li Xuanfeng immediately understood, striking the stone with his palm to extract Si Yuanli’s bloodied lower body. The moment mana began circulating, the wounds on Si Yuanli’s legs rapidly healed.

“The spiritual energy here is unusual... It’s no wonder I made a misstep...” He coughed once, then laughed heartily, “Brother Xuanfeng, your caution has saved both our lives!”

Si Yuanli didn’t suspect that Li Xuanfeng had anticipated anything. After all, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Mahas that they saw were clearly beyond any forecast. Clearly something so catastrophic had occurred that even mighty cultivators were forced to intervene. If even Daoist Masters couldn’t foresee it, how could Li Xuanfeng?

“You flatter me, Brother Yuanli.” Li Xuanfeng watched as he took out pills to heal and replied softly, “If not for that brief delay, even had we entered the grotto heaven, you would still have been protected by your sect’s Daoist Master. Nothing too serious would have happened.”

Si Yuanli was momentarily stunned by those words. He didn’t know what to think, but he replied gently, “Our sect’s Daoist Master may treat his own kindly, but it’s always best to trouble them as little as possible.”

Li Xuanfeng’s thoughts were elsewhere. He spoke in a low, calm voice, “It’s a pity that Chi Tianxing and Chi Fuju from the Chi Family... now have no Chi Family cultivators to shield them within the grotto heaven...”

Before he could finish, Si Yuanli burst into laughter. “I forgot about those two bastards! What a delight! Serves them right!”

Li Xuanfeng lowered his gaze, fingers gripping his golden bow so tightly they turned pale. Meanwhile, Si Yuanli continued laughing in satisfaction. “These two were the most promising of the younger Chi Family generation, and now both are gone! I’d love to see... what talents Chi Zhiyun can turn to next!”

The great void.

The great void was shrouded in endless darkness. Gradually, a harmonious and beautiful arc began to glow, revealing its form within the void. The shape of Anhuai Heaven grew clearer and brighter, becoming the most prominent feature in that space.

More and more gazes turned toward Anhuai Heaven, staring through its transparent and beautiful barrier to observe what lay within. Lu Jiangxian’s divine sense hovered within the great void. It took only the slightest movement for it to slip inside.

Lu Jiangxian’s divine sense was far superior to mere spiritual sense. While the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were still speculating whether Anhuai Heaven even existed, he could already see its form. Now that Anhuai Heaven had fully manifested and others were only just gaining clarity, he had already entered without needing to pass through Great Ning Palace.

After the incident with the five True Monarchs of Green Pine Temple, he had become confident that even Golden Core Realm cultivators couldn’t detect his divine sense. Reassured, he sent a wisp of his divine sense drifting into Anhuai Heaven, where it landed above a small lake.

The lake was only two and a half kilometers across, its waters rippling with a bluish-white radiance. Yet it didn’t seem quite like water, drifting upward like mist before being drawn back by the formation at the lake’s edge.

A grayish-white stone stele inscribed with several ancient seal characters stood at the lake’s edge.

Daling Lake. Lu Jiangxian took one look and immediately recognized it, River Pure Qi

This lake was formed entirely of River Pure Qi. Li Tongya used this very qi for Qi Cultivation, but just a small vial had cost him dozens of spirit stones. Yet here in Anhuai Heaven, there was an entire lake of it, likely intended for cultivators of the Pit Water Dao to refine their techniques.

Just as Lu Jiangxian paused to observe, two figures flew in from the sky and stopped at the same spot. The one in front was a female cultivator in golden robes, her eyes bright and gentle. Behind her stood a figure cloaked in black, faintly shrouded in golden haze.

“Qiushui and Chang Yun...”

The two landed in front of him, but they were unable to see him. They both looked up at the lake. A look of admiration appeared on Qiushui’s face as Daoist Master Chang Yun used mana to transmit his voice, “Ancestor... This Anhuai Heaven is rather strange... we can’t extend our spiritual sense at all... and the formations are still intact... who knows how long it will take to find what we need...”

Daoist Master Qiushui nodded slightly and revealed a golden pearl in her hand, releasing a mist-like golden glow that enveloped the two of them. Then she spoke softly, “No one could’ve expected it would turn out like this... what a pity. Tianque, Tianyuan, and I went through all that secret planning just to protect Zhong Qian... and in the end, there’s no use for him...”

The two did not linger and rose swiftly into the air. Though they were suppressed by the grotto heaven, making their speed modest, Daoist Master Chang Yun chuckled and said, “Ancestor... Zhong Qian is a gentlemanly sort and easy to handle. That’s why we chose him in the first place. Even if he’s not useful here in the grotto heaven, he’ll be a major asset once he establishes a sect in Jiangbei. Who knows? He might even help reform our devil sect into something more like the immortal path...”

Daoist Master Qiushui smiled gently and replied, “That’s true... Xu State is currently empty and pure, with exceptionally rich spiritual energy. Don’t let the efforts and calculations of your grandmaster and me go to waste.”

Their conversation showed clear familiarity, and it turned out that Daoist Master Chang Yun was her junior. His tone carried great respect.

“Of course. It’s just a shame...”

They casually gathered treasures from the palace on the lake’s small island. The items were precious, but no longer of real value to those at the Purple Mansion Realm. Zhang Qiushui kept her focus on detecting any signs of combat.

Meanwhile, Daoist Master Chang Yun sighed softly and said, “Seeing this whole lake of River Pure Qi reminds me of something... Back when we were setting up the plan, I casually placed a piece and handed the River Mountain Sutra to Li Tongya. I thought him exceptional, and suited to the image of a river beast. He might’ve been able to unravel it. But then Maha meddled...

“Later, we saw Li Yuanjiao making swift progress in cultivation. He was ambitious and a true schemer. He might have been capable of stirring up northern Azure Pond, crossing the great river, uniting Jiangbei, and doing something grand. But he died inside the grotto heaven...”
𝗳𝗿𝐞𝕖𝘄𝗲𝕓𝗻𝚘𝚟𝕖𝐥.𝚌𝕠𝕞

Lu Jiangxian sharpened his gaze, and in that moment, saw through Chang Yun’s disguise to a clear view of the man’s face. He looked ordinary, but had a sharp, fierce gaze. A blade was hidden within his robes, suppressed and ready.

So it was you... Lu Jiangxian sighed inwardly. Chang Yun... Zhang Yun.

The man before him was none other than Zhang Yun of the Golden Feather Sect! He had entered seclusion years ago to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Not only had he succeeded in just twenty years, he had even infiltrated the ranks of Eastern Sea’s devil cultivators!

In an instant, all the scattered clues aligned. Why had the Golden Feather Sect spread the Blood Dharma Manual during the devil plague? Why had Chimen Difu, a devil cultivator, known the Golden Feather Sect’s techniques?

Clearly, this had been planned years ago. To avoid suspicion, they had secretly stolen the Blood Dharma Manual from the Miao Family of the Southern Sea, quietly gathered a group of devil cultivators, and converted several northern disciples of the sect, like Chimen Difu and Zhang Huaide, into devil cultivators and scattered them across Jiangbei...

It was all for the moment Zhang Yun achieved his breakthrough; he could immediately rally a loyal force of devil cultivators and instantly alter the balance between north and south. Leveraging the chaotic situation in Xu State, he fabricated the identity of Daoist Master Chang Yun and justified the establishment of his own sect.

It also explained why Zhong Qian, who was supposedly dead and his dharma artifact long divided, had suddenly reappeared among devil cultivators. Naturally, the Golden Feather Sect had secretly protected him, grooming him as a pawn for this very day, so he could enter Anhuai Heaven!

“Furthermore, as the founder of a sect and a key figure in the northern-southern struggle, Chang Yun could even claim a spot in Great Ning Palace. If everything went according to plan, the specially preserved Zhong Qian would shine brightly within Anhuai Heaven and seize countless treasures...

“This plot would allow Golden Feather to not only gain two entrance slots, but also secretly establish their own sect in fertile Jiangbei. It would secure the northern flank... and ferry endless spirit herbs and spirit items from the spiritual-energy-rich Jiangbei into the Golden Feather Sect...

“This was the Golden Feather Sect’s century-long plan... A hundred years ago, they foresaw the Shangyuan breakthrough, predicted inevitable chaos in Jiangbei, and how several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would join forces. They began planning in secret, and now, at last, the fruits have begun to ripen.”
