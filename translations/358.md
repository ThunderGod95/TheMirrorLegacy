# Chapter 439: Story

"Let's talk while we ride the wind."

Kong Yu, anxious and fearing that his opportunity to earn might be snatched away by his seniors or juniors, could hardly stay at the foot of the mountain gate for even a moment longer.

He soared through Shanji Prefecture as he explained, "According to my master, someone from an immortal gate of the Dao lineage on Mount Luoxia in the north has descended to undergo a tribulation. I'm not sure who he is, but his plan is to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm in nine months, establish a foundation over three years, find a beauty, dismantle clans, eliminate devil cultivators, and enjoy all the benefits of wealth... then return to the north..."

"T-That's..."

Li Xuanxuan, though skeptical, could not refute it and simply muttered under his breath, "If that's the case, it shouldn't be a problem for us to just pass through there..."

Kong Yu's face showed a flicker of terror as he responded in a low voice, "Fellow Daoist, you probably only think that he's nothing but a genius because you haven't encountered someone like him before. When you meet someone with fate or even Metallic Essence, you'll understand!"

"Senior Tongya should be aware of this as well... you might want to ask him," he added.

After saying this, Kong Yu fell silent and refrained from revealing more details, leaving Li Xuanxuan to infer what he would.

The two shifted the conversation to other topics, and by the time they left Shanji Prefecture, night had fallen. Kong Yu took out a jade box and placed it on his palm. He puffed his cheeks, blew out a black cloud, and explained, "Fellow Daoist, this Night Cloud is a dharma artifact that can provide concealment. Given the dangers on this road, you and your spirit beast should join me in this."

"Alright!"

Li Xuanxuan accepted his offer without hesitation. Despite Profound Peak Gate's current desolation, it still had a rich legacy. Naturally, as the descendant of Daoist Master Changxi, Kong Yu possessed many treasures.

With devil cultivators rampant and the two unable to pass through Yufu Prefecture, they were forced to navigate hills and forests filled with wild temples and rogue cultivators, where countless devil cultivators might lie in ambush. It was indeed perilous.

They had to pause their journey to cultivate during the day and resume at night. Kong Yu, who was both talkative and knowledgeable in the way of talismans, compared his notes with Li Xuanxuan, and both found the exchange extremely fruitful.

One day, as they flew toward the junction of Yue State and Xu State, they witnessed a devil cultivator fleeing on the wind, streaking across the night sky like a stream of golden light. A figure behind him, wielding a golden ring, pursued him relentlessly.

The scene was all too familiar, and they typically avoided such conflicts. Given that both the immortal and the devil were peak Qi Cultivators, provoking them was unwise.

Kong Yu stopped and whispered, "Those are people from the Golden Tang Gate... The Situ Family has some engagements with my Kong Family, so it's not right for me to just stand by. I'll lend him a hand."

As soon as Kong Yu finished speaking, he summoned a jade seal and hurled it directly at the devil cultivator. Li Xuanxuan sighed and began casting spells, using talismans to assist in restraining the devil cultivator.

Boom!

The devil cultivator, who was already exhausted, was overwhelmed by the combined assault from both parties. With two disciples from the immortal sect pressing on his tail, his several life-saving escape techniques proved futile. He met his end after only a few dozen exchanges.

The disciple from the Golden Tang Gate, wielding a golden ring that glowed with a hazy golden light, captured the devil cultivator's body and drew it toward him. It was clear he intended to claim the spoils for himself.

"Who are you?" he asked bluntly.

Li Xuanxuan didn't feel like answering him so he moved behind Kong Yu, pretending to be his lackey. Kong Yu frowned and replied, "I am Kong Yu from Profound Peak. It's been a while since I've seen anyone from the Golden Tang Gate. I'm not here to share in the spoils but rather to repay the favor of the past... I'm helping you out of gratitude."

"Oh," the young man replied indifferently, giving Kong Yu the cold shoulder.

"Oh? I see that you're a really friendly person, fellow Daoist," Kong Yu remarked sarcastically. Feeling a mix of embarrassment and anger, he swung his sleeves and turned to leave.

The young man, however, sneered and said, "And here I was, wondering who you are... It turns out you're from the One Stick of Incense Clan!"

Kong Yu's face flushed with rage instantly. His Dharma artifact flew into the air as he shouted, "How dare you, junior?!"

The young man remained unfazed, disdain evident on his face as he said, "Let me remind you that Kong Nuanmeng married Situ Li, who was already eliminated by my Situ Mo's lineage. If the Kong Family dares to mention past favors again, it'll be no different from challenging my family!"

Kong Yu's face turned into a mix of amusement and anger as he gritted his teeth and spat, "Fool! How did a great man like Situ Tang raise imbeciles like you?!"

With that, he turned and left, ignoring the shocked and furious expression of Situ Mo, the direct descendant of the Golden Tang Gate. He quickly took to the wind, with Li Xuanxuan hiding in the clouds. Li Xuanxuan let out a long sigh of relief when Situ Mo did not pursue them.

"Why provoke him, fellow Daoist? The Golden Tang Gate is known for its offensive cultivation techniques, and this Situ Mo seems like a legitimate heir. That golden ring he wields is quite formidable... Angering him could spell trouble for us."

Even if a fight did occur, Kong Yu, an old man who had failed to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm despite nearly a hundred years of effort, knew he would not be in immediate danger. However, the outcome might not be as favorable for Li Xuanxuan, who was merely a talisman crafter. Naturally, he feared for his life.

Kong Yu sighed and murmured, "In the past, Daoist Master Changxi visited Mount Golden Tang and helped the Golden Tang Sect move several mountains, which led to an alliance through marriage... I never imagined that time would fill the Situ Family with such arrogant descendants."

Golden Tang Gate had been in turmoil for so long, naturally, Kong Yu was aware of the changes within the Situ Family. The branch of the Kong Family that had married into the Situ Family had been wiped out long ago.

The Kong Family, being weak and unwilling to make enemies, had opted to focus on maintaining their alliance with the Golden Tang Gate rather than seeking retribution. However, Situ Mo's harsh words earlier had only chilled Kong Yu's heart.

"Clan that lasted only the duration of a stick of incense" was definitely an insult that left an impression on Li Xuanxuan. Despite his curiosity, he held back his questions and offered a few words of comfort while waiting for Kong Yu to explain further.

Unlike a sheltered disciple who had grown up on the immortal mountain, Li Xuanxuan was an astute man, having mingled with the secular world for decades.

Given how Kong Yu brought up his deceased senior brother and past favors, Li Xuanxuan realized that Kong Yu was someone who struggled to hide his grief and tended to wallow in self-pity.

After a brief silence, Kong Yu finally spoke, as expected.

"To be honest, the Kong Family has suffered greatly due to the incident in Yufu Prefecture. My grandfather perished in this affair. While searching for spirit items near Jishui Prefecture in Xu State, he lost his senses and acted like a madman. Everything would have been fine if he had found a small tavern to rest, but instead, he insulted a young man.

"The young man sneered and walked away. Six months later, he attacked our clan and killed my grandfather... Despite being a top immortal cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm, my ancestor allowed a mere Qi Cultivator to escape!"

Li Xuanxuan felt as though he was listening to a storybook.

"How is that possible..?" he exclaimed in disbelief.

"How is it not possible?"

Kong Yu's face darkened, gritting his teeth as he continued, "The ancestor's son was killed before him, yet in his confusion, he ended up playing a game with that boy about holding on for the duration of an incense stick! He even lost and became a laughingstock! Funny, isn't it?!"

Kong Yu laughed bitterly, then continued softly with a pained expression, "The people we sent out lost their minds and became fools to be consumed as mere fodder by the enemy. Ultimately, even our ancestor, who was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, also fell to that boy. He desecrated our family's immortal mountain, dismantled the Kong Family, and eventually returned to the north."

"Where was Daoist Master Changxi?" Li Xuanxuan asked, his throat dry from listening to the story.

Kong Yu replied softly, "Daoist Master Changxi did eventually break through and return. However, within three years, our Kong Family was scattered and nicknamed the One Stick of Incense Clan. Terrified, Daoist Master Changxi relocated from Xu State, leading to the founding of Profound Peak Gate."

The story left Li Xuanxuan's back drenched in a cold sweat. He sighed as realization dawned upon him.

No wonder Profound Peak Gate is in its current state of decline‚Äîmost of their cultivators have perished, and they have yet to recover from this incident...

Kong Yu continued with a sorrowful expression, "The disaster that befell my Kong Family is a tale of utter helplessness. I can only imagine how much despair my ancestor must have felt when faced with such calamity. This incident stirred up a sensation in Xu State, and the surviving clan members who scattered among various families were well-known."

Li Xuanxuan asked curiously, "Do you know the name of that person back then...?"

Kong Yu spread his hands and smiled wryly.

"A name? I dare not utter it."

Li Xuanxuan was momentarily at a loss. After hearing the story, he sensed that something was amiss.

"If you are so wary of offending him, why persist in publicizing this? It won't benefit your family. It might even save future generations by letting the matter be forgotten..." he commented carefully.

Li Xuanxuan thought to himself, Isn't spreading this story everywhere just sending a message to that person that the Kong Family is still resentful of what happened...?

Kong Yu gazed at him and replied, "I dare not comment, resent, or forget this matter. Even if I speak of it, I will tell the entire story‚Äînot for any other reason but to spread it far and wide, hoping to appease that person and ensure our survival."

"After all, it is a tale painstakingly crafted by that person. As long as the story is widely known, the Kong Family will stand as a monument to their efforts, and that person may be less inclined to see us perish."

"If even the villain of the story has forgotten this story, how can the audience still find it engaging?" Kong Yu added in a deep voice.

Li Family...

As the year drew to a close and snow began to fall, the day for collecting tributes approached.

Li Yuanping meticulously reviewed the records. The Li Family now governed five peaks and eighteen towns, supporting 320,000 people. With the additional 280,000 from Eastern Mount Yue, the total population reached 600,000.

This population growth was due to the efforts of the three brothers, Li Yuanxiu, Li Yuanjiao, and Li Yuanping, who had relocated people from the densely populated Lijing and Huaqian areas to the newly acquired Mount Huazhong and Yuting. Additionally, the devil plague had driven families on the eastern shore to seek refuge with the Li Family.

"600,000 people!"

The Li Family's wealth, with its five peaks, was second only to the fertile fields of Milin and far superior to the deep mountains and old forests of the Fei Family. Supporting 600,000 people was already at the limit of their capacity.

Despite having only a handful of Qi Cultivators, the Li Family boasted the largest number of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators among all the families. The establishment of the governance system overnight on the five peaks dramatically increased the number of registered Embryonic Breathing cultivators this year from nearly 200 to over 300.

Li Yuanping understood the dynamics well. Prominent families saw the financial benefits and quickly integrated their cultivators into the Li Family. Similarly, it also attracted other rogue cultivators to join.

"Money is certainly motivating!"

Li Yuanping sneered, his pale face reflecting his disdain.

The prominent families and external cultivators probably still keep more than half of their Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators to themselves, fearing that I, Li Yuanping, might cheat them!

He glanced over the lists and muttered, "Once you've registered... you'll no longer have a say!"

"Get everyone to come in!"

At his command, Dou Yi went to deliver the order.

A procession of cultivators soon entered, led by An Zheyan and Tian Zhongqing. The An and Tian families had made significant contributions, so they naturally took the lead, followed by representatives from the Chen, Xu, Ren, and other families.

Li Yuanping addressed the assembly, "The Tian Family made the greatest contribution to combating the devil plague this time. Tian Zhongqing, you will be assigned as the Peak Guardian of Mount Huaqian."

Tian Zhongqing was not surprised by Li Yuanping's decision.

Li Yuanping's administrative system had three key positions‚ÄîPeak Manager, Peak Guardian, and Peak Overseer.

The Peak Overseer would be one of the direct descendants of the Li Family, responsible for overseeing the formation plate. This role did not require an exceptionally powerful member, as the main responsibility was to periodically inspect the formation plate. The rest of the time, the Peak Overseer could cultivate in peace.

The Peak Manager would be assigned to an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. Their responsibilities included overseeing taxes, general affairs, and inspections. Additionally, about ten other Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators would assist the Peak Manager. Although it was a labor-intensive role, it was not a suitable position for Tian Zhongqing.

The Peak Guardian would be a Qi Cultivator responsible for guarding and defending against demons and devils. This role required the strongest cultivator but was also the most relaxed, making it an ideal position for Tian Zhongqing, who, at forty, was in his prime for enhancing his cultivation.

"Xu Gongming will be the Peak Guardian of Mount Yuting, Xu Shumu the Peak Manager of Mount Huazhong, Xu Gongyu the Peak Manager of Mount Wutu, and Shamoli will also be stationed on Mount Wutu as the Peak Guardian..."

Li Yuanping only promoted seasoned veterans and officials who had distinguished themselves during the devil plague. Each peak is now governed by one Qi Cultivator, three various unrefined Qi Cultivators, and dozens of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators. Most of these Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators were assigned to farming and other chores rather than remaining on the mountain.

With the major positions filled, Li Yuanping skipped the rest.

The other cultivators looked at him with anticipation, only to see him lower the document in his hand and say, "There's still a shortage of cultivators. Until the peaks are adequately staffed with Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, I will promote those who have shown merit."

Li Yuanping observed their bewildered expressions and smiled as he said, "There are only limited positions at each peak. Based on cultivation and merit, each position comes with dharma artifacts, elixirs, and cave dwellings, which are burdensome for the clan to provide."

At the mention of dharma artifacts and elixirs, the eyes of the guest cultivators, prominent families, and branches grew intense. In a world where devil cultivators were rampant, venturing out could be perilous. Hence, dharma artifacts and elixirs were highly coveted.

The Li Family's resources were scarce, and the cultivators under their rule were impoverished. Although the positions at the peaks came with dharma artifacts, these were expected to be returned upon resignation. Nevertheless, many other families lacked even a single dharma artifact.

Moreover, elixirs and cave dwellings were critical for cultivation. The opportunity to improve one's abilities and extend one's lifespan is hard to resist...

Noticing the greed and ambitions in everyone's eyes, Li Yuanping nodded and dismissed the assembly.

The Snake Demon Cave Dwelling is larger than I anticipated... The direct lineage won't have to worry about having a cave dwelling to cultivate. These caves on the mountain are surplus, the dharma artifacts are simply lying around. The only costs we have to worry about are clan stipends and elixirs...

Li Yuanping sighed, reviewed a few reports, and prepared to expand the Jade Court Guards and Clan Affairs Courtyard.

"Salary increases... Spirit Paddies, Spirit Stones, and elixirs... There's a shortage of everything. The spirit resources at the bottom of Moongaze Lake are simply too scarce! It would be ideal if we could gain access to Mount Dali freely..."
