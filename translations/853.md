# Chapter 853: Turmoil

As Li Jiangqian finished speaking, the woman beside him nodded. "Just consider it carefully," she said softly. "I just returned from seeing the Old Master. He also asked about it, and his thinking is... now is not a good time."

Since Li Minggong had put it that way, Li Jiangqian naturally agreed, making a mental note of the matter. He placed two letters on the desk. "There's one more thing," he said quietly. "The situation with Daoist Shouding has been resolved."

When Daoist Shouding had left the Li Clan, he had originally intended to go to the Chen Clan. But Li Jiangqian had intercepted him, sending letters to both the Chen Clan and Mount Jingyi. The replies had now arrived.

"One is from the Yuyang Chen Clan. It's mostly just thanks for our warning. The messenger they sent contacted Shouding and told him that the Chen Clan is also in turmoil. If he were to visit, he should first go to one of their strongholds in the Southern Borderlands."

Li Jiangqian shook his head with a hint of resignation. "Although Daoist Shouding was full of doubt, he could read between the lines and see it was a polite refusal, so he didn't go. The other letter is from Mount Jingyi. They arranged for him to travel through the Southern Borderlands. He had no choice but to head south in frustration."

Li Minggong let out a soft sigh, but Li Jiangqian added with some surprise, "Mount Jingyi is strange, though. The letter was very polite to our clan, but they gave Shouding a thorough dressing-down. It seems they are a Daoist tradition with quite a bit of character."

He joked as he saw Li Minggong out, his mind still turning over their earlier conversation.

The Fei Clan held a degree of autonomy on the North Bank, a situation the Li Clan hadn't touched for many years. There had been no shortage of dissenting voices within the clan. Regardless of the discussions in the main hall, the two major families, the Chen Clan and the An Clan, held firm in their stance: the Fei Clan's autonomy must be curtailed, if not outright absorbed.

'Chen Yang is smart,' Li Jiangqian thought. 'On a sensitive issue like this, the Chen Clan really has no other choice…'

'As for the An Clan…'

The old patriarch of the An Clan, An Zheyan, was still alive. He had once paid respects to Li Tongya, giving him a status comparable to Chen Donghe of the Chen Clan. But the true leader was his son, An Siwei.

This Guest Elder An had once been one of the Li Clan's few protectors at the Foundation Establishment Realm and was heavily relied upon. But as soon as the Li Clan produced a cultivator at the Purple Mansion Realm, his shallow immortal foundation became inadequate. Later, he was captured by enemies. By the time he returned, his position had been usurped by the younger generation. He had kept a low profile ever since, but on this matter, he had spoken out several times, to the point of causing the Fei Clan considerable embarrassment.

As for the other branches, most remained silent. Of the four elders from the Zhou generation—Zhoufang and Zhou Yang—they were too busy securing benefits for their descendants to care about such matters, essentially rubber-stamping whatever the clan decided. Xinghan and Zhouming were even less involved, their voices barely heard.

The sole remaining descendant of the Chengming generation, Li Chenghao, was a stern and eccentric man whose thoughts were usually hard to guess. And while Li Minggong and Li Xuanxuan had never given a definitive statement, their current attitude suggested it was not the time to move against the Fei Clan.

'Fei Qingya… So long as Fei Qingya makes no move, any plans the Fei Clan has are just empty talk… But she will cultivate the River-Center Clear Qi, which makes things difficult with Fei Qing'yi. I’ll have to find some excuse to dismiss him… Strange. Why haven't the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators made any arrangements for her?'

Lost in thought, he heard a light rap on the door, followed by the sound of hurried footsteps. Two figures rushed to the front of the hall. One was stout and honest-looking; he immediately dropped to his knees to kowtow. The other was so agitated he bypassed the courtesy entirely, striding inside with an imposing aura, his face a grim, ashen mask.

"Greetings, Clan Head!"

A flicker of understanding crossed Li Jiangqian's mind. One of the men was Li Wen, a veteran steward of several generations who managed their headquarters at Jade Court. The other was Li Chenghao, the last of the Chengming generation, a Qi Refining cultivator in charge of Qingdu. Li Jiangqian immediately descended from his seat. "What's wrong?"

Li Chenghao's face was pale, his lips bloodless. "Reporting to the Clan Head," he said in a low voice, "Zhouyang's life jade has shattered."

"Second Uncle?!"

Li Chenghao had lost nearly all his own children to clan affairs, and his daughter, Li Xingsai, had also died at the hands of demonic cultivators. He had raised his two nephews, Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang of the Zhou generation, as his own sons.

The two brothers were influential figures within the clan, known for always looking out for their younger relatives. Their high prestige and tendency to favour their kin had made them a thorn in the side of the clan's managers. For that reason, Li Jiangqian had reassigned them to the Eastern shore and brought Li Chenghao back to manage Qingdu. He never expected something like this to happen.

"How could this be!"

Although this elder's talent wasn't top-tier, he was a core member of the direct line and a senior figure of the Zhou generation. His status was significant. A jolt of anger shot through Li Jiangqian. "What about… what about First Uncle? The two elders were on the Eastern shore together… Has there been any word?!"

Li Chenghao shook his head, his stoic face contorted with pain. "No news," he bit out, "but thankfully, his life jade is intact. He's safe."

Li Jiangqian let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding.

Although First Uncle Li Zhoufang and Second Uncle Li Zhouyang had always acted in unison and were close in status and cultivation, their standing in Li Jiangqian's mind was vastly different.

It came down to one simple fact: Li Zhoufang was the father of Li Queyi, who was training with the Purple Smoke Gate, and Li Jiangzong, a rising star within the clan. Li Zhouyang was merely their uncle.

It was a cruel calculation, but a flicker of relief crossed Li Jiangqian's mind, quickly replaced by confusion and rage. He looked at Li Wen, who was still kneeling before the hall. Just then, another set of footsteps approached. Chen Yang, clad in black armour, strode in, knelt on one knee, and presented a letter with both hands.

Li Minggong and Li Xuanxuan entered with him. Li Minggong's expression was merely grim, but Li Xuanxuan looked both pained and furious. Neither of them disturbed Li Jiangqian, standing silently to the side.

Li Jiangqian gave a slight bow, took the letter with a heavy expression, and read it through before passing it to Li Xuanxuan.

As the old man read, Li Jiangqian's voice turned cold. "Today, our clan was engaged in a Dharma Art battle with the Capital immortals Dao in the northern wilderness. A group of Foundation Establishment Realm demonic cultivators secretly entered the area, raided the Eastern shore, broke through two great formations, and killed many of our people. Although Protector Cui arrived in time… it was already too late."

Reading this, Li Jiangqian already understood. The Li Clan's battle with the Capital immortals Dao on the river was at a predictable time and place. A sneak attack would have been easily trapped. This meant they had been set up by someone else.

"First Uncle and Second Uncle were on the Eastern shore today, and they were supposed to be with Protector An. The duties were divided, and today was supposed to be First Uncle's shift. But he had Second Uncle take his place. That one switch saved his life."

Li Chenghao, his heart burning with rage, finished reading and passed the letter to Li Wen beside him. He prostrated himself on the floor, his voice sharp. "The wilderness are teeming with our clan's eyes and ears! For a group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to appear out of nowhere and infiltrate the Eastern shore, they must have had the aid of a concealment-type Dharma artifact! This was no ordinary raid! Someone deliberately plotted against us… I implore the Clan Head to investigate thoroughly!"

Li Jiangqian already knew this. The ones who harmed his clan were no mere demonic cultivators or rogue cultivators. His expression darkened as other doubts surfaced. Li Wen kowtowed and said, "Our clan occupies the western part of the wilderness. To be attacked in our heartland means this group came from the east, downstream. The territories downstream belong to the Capital immortals Dao, the Sacred Writ Gate, and the Xuanmiao Temple…"

Li Jiangqian shook his head. "With a high-quality concealment Dharma artifact, passing through their territories wouldn't be difficult. We must wait for Protector Cui to return and question him."

At his words, Li Chenghao had no choice but to rein in his temper.

The Eastern shore was close. Not long after the life jade at Qingdu had shattered, a commotion was heard outside. Cui Jueyin landed on the central isle and ascended with an uneasy expression.

Following him was Li Zhoufang. The uncle who was always scheming for his descendants had lost all of his usual simple-mindedness. His face was a ghastly shade of green and white. He collapsed to his knees with a thud. "Clan Head…" he stammered, trembling. "You must avenge him! My brother… he worked diligently his entire life, only to be murdered by our enemies… Not even his bones remain! He didn't even have many children!"

He wept uncontrollably, and Li Jiangqian felt the situation becoming increasingly difficult. This was no time for formalities. After calming Li Chenghao and Li Zhoufang, he had Cui Jueyin come forward directly. "Protector Cui," he said, his voice laced with anger, "you saw the demonic cultivators. What were they wearing? Did you uncover any clues about their movements?"

Cui Jueyin hesitated, glancing at Li Jiangqian and then at Li Chenghao. The middle-aged man had just lost a nephew he'd watched grow up; the weight of his grief was unimaginable to the others. Cui Jueyin's hesitation made him lose his patience.

Seeing Li Chenghao's volatile state, Cui Jueyin finally spoke, his expression troubled. "I don't know their exact numbers… but they were all at the Foundation Establishment Realm and wielded Dharma artifacts that seemed particularly effective at breaking formations. The two great formations weren't very sophisticated; they were like paper… broken in an instant."

"Two of them engaged me in a Dharma Art battle. Protector An, Miaoshui, and many other cultivators present saw it… One used 'Converging Water,' his immortal foundation unknown. The other was very obvious… it was 'Sorrowful Southern Water'… He even used some remarkably high-quality talismans to escape… He is definitely not from an ordinary background."

"I pursued them all the way to the Sacred Writ Gate's territory, only to find that they too were fighting a group of demonic cultivators in a fierce battle. I had no choice but to retreat."

At these words, Li Jiangqian frowned immediately, understanding Cui Jueyin's reluctance to speak.

Sorrowful Southern Water!

There was only one Purple Mansion Realm power in the world famous for cultivating Sorrowful Southern Water: the Capital immortals Dao, the very same force facing the Li Clan from across the river.

'How is that possible!'

Li Jiangqian was stunned, but comprehension dawned on Li Chenghao. He fell to his knees with a thud. "It really was the Capital immortals Dao!" he cried out in grief. "They tied up our main forces on the river while secretly sending cultivators to infiltrate the Eastern shore and ambush us! Just as I thought… the Capital immortals Dao… they've been plotting against our clan for a long time!"

Li Jiangqian helped him up. "There are many in Jiangnan who cultivate Sorrowful Southern Water. The Lingu Family does as well. It's just one type of immortal foundation; we can't draw any conclusions yet. Grand-uncle, please take care of yourself…"

But Li Chenghao refused to rise. Li Zhoufang, his face streaked with tears, gritted his teeth. "There may be many who use Sorrowful Southern Water, but there is only one who is our sworn enemy!"

Li Chenghao turned to Cui Jueyin, his voice choked with sobs. "Protector Cui, since you fought our enemies, you must have a sense of their skill! Were their Dharma Arts refined? Was their immortal foundation profound? Surely you can judge their level! If they were from some motley group of Daoist traditions, they would have been no match for you!"

"To escape from your hands without leaving a trace… I fear it could only be that family from across the river that cultivates Sorrowful Southern Water!"

Li Chenghao's hatred ran deep. The death of his daughter, Li Xingsai, years ago was also linked to the Capital immortals Dao. Now, Li Zhouyang's death was added to the tally. How could he not be grinding his teeth in fury?

Though he was typically stern and odd, his mind was as sharp as anyone's. He had immediately grasped the key point, asking the very questions Li Jiangqian and Li Xuanxuan wanted to ask. Cui Jueyin sighed. "The man's cultivation method was very profound, certainly from a reputable Daoist tradition. His spell arts were no weaker than my Cui Clan's. Unfortunately, his cultivation level was lacking. He only escaped by using several high-grade talismans."

With that description, the man might as well have had the words "Capital immortals Dao" tattooed on his face.

Li Jiangqian sighed inwardly. Not everyone was privy to the situation in Jiangbei. From Li Chenghao's perspective, this could only be the work of the Capital immortals Dao. But Cui Jueyin and the others knew of the private understanding between the two powers. Li Jiangqian refused to believe that at a moment like this, Guan Gongxiao would lose his mind and plot against their clan.

'Guan Gongxiao is pragmatic, but he's not a reckless fool. He wouldn't do something like this for such a small, short-term gain…'

He glanced at Cui Jueyin, who clearly looked at a loss, unsure how to explain the situation. After a moment of thought, Li Jiangqian heard Li Xuanxuan let out a long sigh. The old man tapped his cane on the ground and straightened up, his voice aged but clear.

"Chenghao, our clan is in a standoff with the Capital immortals Dao in the north, but it is just that—a standoff. Both sides are holding back, afraid of the consequences, unwilling to make a real move. Now, something like this happens out of the blue, with the undisguised use of Sorrowful Southern Water. Do you not think it's possible some other power is watching with greedy eyes, fanning the flames in secret, hoping our clan and the one across the river will fight to the death so they can be the fisherman who reaps the rewards? That would only bring pain to our loved ones and joy to our enemies!"

"A profound Sorrowful Southern Water technique may be a symbol of the Capital immortals Dao and the Lingu Family, but that doesn't mean it can't fall into the hands of others. If our rivals across the river truly had such capabilities, why wouldn't they use them to launch a sneak attack during the great battle on the river? Why would they go through all this trouble to kill a mere Qi Refining cultivator? Just to spite us?"

His words had a considerable effect. Li Chenghao's expression shifted, a hint of doubt appearing, though the fury in his eyes did not recede. He remained prostrated on the ground. "The Old Master is right. I was reckless… But this happened under the watchful eyes of everyone on the Eastern shore. If we don't react… the consequences will be dire."

Li Chenghao had a point. The Li Clan's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were not often seen. To suffer such a blow, the murder of an influential elder from the direct line, without any response would surely damage their prestige.

But Li Jiangqian only frowned and turned to Li Zhoufang. "First Uncle," he asked softly, "what delayed you by half an hour?"

Li Zhoufang wiped away his tears, no longer caring for appearances. "It's a rather shameful affair, but I must speak of it now. I brought a concubine with me to the Eastern shore, and I discovered signs of her infidelity. I was consumed by rage at the time and spent half an hour dragging out her lover… and because of that… because of that…"

"I understand."

Only then did Li Jiangqian look away, changing the subject. "Did the elder leave behind any personal effects? How shall the incense offerings be arranged? Please have the Qingdu branch handle these matters first. I will send people to make inquiries… there may be an answer. Please rest assured, Grand-uncle, this matter will not be dropped… but to vent our anger, we must first find the true culprit."

"As for the Eastern shore, I will have Chen Yang go and search for clues."

Li Zhoufang immediately kowtowed in thanks, tears streaming down his face. But Li Chenghao was not so easily placated. Hearing no specific timeline, he remained silent, looking up until Li Minggong shot him a glance. He had no choice but to kowtow twice more before leading Li Zhoufang away.

Li Jiangqian had someone close the hall doors. His face instantly darkened. "Which power is so bold…" he said in a low voice, "to dare stir up this kind of trouble in the wilderness at a time like this! They must truly hate our clan to the bone…"

Li Minggong's expression was just as cold. "I think something is wrong on the Eastern shore as well. For Zhouyang to run into them means his position was exposed."

"That's inevitable!" Li Xuanxuan shook his head. "Our own Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are right by the river. Of course there's no need to hide their movements. Who could have expected a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators to appear suddenly from the mountains, their presence concealed?"

"The plan now is to search the Eastern shore and communicate with the Capital immortals Dao."

Li Jiangqian pondered for a few seconds before asking, "Why bother? I believe the Old Master's earlier words were more accurate. Someone wants to see us fight the Capital immortals Dao more fiercely, or perhaps they don't want to see us secretly reconcile…"

Li Minggong sighed. "But following that line of thought, the Sacred Writ Gate, the Xuanmiao Sect, and even the Chengyun Gate are all possibilities."

Li Jiangqian fell silent, a sense of unease growing in his heart.

'Where are Daoist Master Tinglan and Daoist Master Qiuhu? It's one thing for Fei Qingya to be left without arrangements for the Qi she cultivates, but now a group of people has caused chaos in the wilderness, and there's still no reaction from them…'

As far as he knew, Ning Wan was at Lake Xian, so it was understandable she couldn't intervene. But now Tinglan had also vanished. Events in Jiangbei had likely taken a different turn, forcing this Purple Mansion Realm expert to head further north. Li Jiangqian sighed heavily and continued, "Furthermore, I fear a divine ability was involved in this. First Uncle narrowly escaped with his life. Could it be that the mastermind didn't want to involve the Purple Smoke Gate? If so, this is far more troublesome than we thought!"

"Unlikely." Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard and shook his head, sighing. "You may not know, but I do. This wasn't a one-day affair. He deliberately had Second Brother take his place so he could hide and observe. A Purple Mansion Realm expert wouldn't set up such a protracted scheme… especially one that began back on the lake. It makes no sense. I think it was just… luck!"

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian's expression actually improved. He nodded. "Then I'm more confident. Putting everything together, I don't think it was the Chengyun or Xuanmiao Sects. They don't have the inclination for this right now… In fact, they probably see that our conflict with the Capital immortals Dao is just an act. Making a move like this would be asking for trouble… needlessly dirtying their own hands."

"As for the Sacred Writ Gate, Daoist Master Zhu Gong is a friend of Daoist Master Tinglan. While she governs with a gentle hand, she isn't so lenient as that. The demonic cultivators under her command wouldn't have the loyalty to start such a fire."

He turned and drew out a sheet of letter paper. "For this matter," he said seriously, "I think we should make inquiries toward the Eastern Sea."

But before Li Jiangqian could elaborate, another clamour of footsteps was heard outside. He had the hall doors opened to let them in. The old man Qu Bushi hurried forward, his face a mixture of shock and bewilderment.

"Reporting to the Clan Head and all the elders… the Hall of the Locust Soul has crossed the Fanyun Territory and… and is fighting the Golden Tang Gate!"

Li Jiangqian was not surprised by the news. He descended from the dais. "The Golden Tang Gate?"

"Indeed!"

Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow. "When did this news arrive?"

"Last night, it is said."

Li Minggong had a very poor impression of the Golden Tang Gate. She should have been pleased by this news, but with the death of a direct clan member, her interest was muted. She just shook her head. "They deserve it… The Golden Tang Gate was insufferably arrogant in Jiangbei back in the day. Their time has come. How many people do they even have left in their entire gate? I estimate they truly are no match for that motley crew from the Hall of the Locust Soul."

"What pretext are they using?" Li Minggong asked.

Qu Bushi quickly replied, "To unify the Baijiang Creek region… I heard that not long after the Hall of the Locust Soul was established, the Golden Feather Sect sent representatives to acknowledge their rule in Jiangbei, even mentioning that the Three Rivers region belonged to the Hall."

"The Golden Tang Gate also has territory in Baijiang Creek, so Daoist Bo used this to start trouble. Normally, that territory isn't much, especially since the Golden Tang Gate has sealed its mountain and has few holdings left. They could have just given it up…"

"But the Hall of the Locust Soul didn't just want the territory; they also demanded the nearby spirit mines… The Situ Clan has no other source of income now and relies on those to survive. Naturally, they refused."

Li Jiangqian let out a sigh of relief, shaking his head inwardly.

'I thought I was running out of time, but I underestimated Daoist Bo's greed. He now has fortune on his side, so no Purple Mansion Realm cultivator will use a divine ability to guide him. This is purely his own avarice…'

"What does the Golden Feather Sect have to say?"

Qu Bushi hurriedly explained, "Ever since Daoist Master Tianhuo appeared in person, took the Golden Tang Gate's treasures, and treated their members with utter disdain… the rumours in Jiangbei have faded. The cultivators of the Golden Tang Gate were overcome with shame and anger and no longer dare to speak of friendly relations with the Golden Feather Sect. Daoist Bo… likely saw this as his chance to boldly advance westward."

Li Jiangqian nodded. So much had happened in a single day. He rubbed his temples and suddenly asked, "The Golden Tang Gate still has Situ Ku… he's in our clan's dungeon, isn't he?"

Situ Ku had been imprisoned by the Li Clan for many years, his cultivation sealed, kept under house arrest. Furthermore, the Ding Clan had once been in the Funan territory, and Ding Weizeng had some acquaintance with Situ Ku. Thanks to this connection, the old man's life had been reasonably comfortable.

'The Golden Tang Gate has been abandoned by the Golden Feather Sect. After all, they did their dirty work for so many years that their reputation in both Jiangnan and Jiangbei is rotten to the core. They won't have a good end fighting the Hall of the Locust Soul.'

'This fight will buy the True Monarch time to grow. Once those mines are lost and the Situ Clan is forced to retreat into their mountain, the ascendant Hall of the Locust Soul will be the perfect stage for the main act.'

As for the Situ Clan catching the True Monarch's favour, the chances were slim. The number of Daoist traditions and Purple Mansion Realm experts they had offended in Jiangbei and Jiangnan could be counted on more than one hand. Their reputation stank, and everyone was content to just watch them fall.

Thinking of Situ Ku at this moment, Li Jiangqian's intentions were similarly calculating. The old man was weak-willed and greedy, incredibly easy to manipulate. Crucially, his cultivation was high enough to be significant in the now-weakened Golden Tang Gate…

'The Tangdao Mountain Range is protected by a great formation. The Hall of the Locust Soul is unlikely to break through. The end result will probably be another sealed mountain. Once this is over, Situ Ku will be an important figure. All in all, a good pawn to have.'
