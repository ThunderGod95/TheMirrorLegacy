# Chapter 860: The Might of the Supreme Yang

Upon hearing this, Li Jiangqian took a step back and bowed.

"We obey the immortal decree of the esteemed Upper Sect. We will convey your intentions to our Daoist Master at once."

There was no other choice. After what Daoist Master Kui Qi had said, remaining neutral was no longer an option. Even a refusal would have to come from Li Ximing himself.

Besides, the Daoist Master had framed it cleverly. If they helped, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition would remember the favor. But if they stood by and did nothing, their inaction would be remembered all the same.

Having spoken, Li Jiangqian gave an order.

"Go and request the Old Master's presence. And bring out the clan's jade talisman."

The Great Xiukui Monastery was famously aloof, and their Daoist tradition was esoteric and strange. From Houfu a few years ago to Kui Qi now, none of them were mild-mannered. Li Jiangqian deliberately humbled himself, using deferential language like "obey the esteemed decree," which made the Daoist Master chuckle.

"You're being far too polite," he said.

Despite his words, he was clearly pleased. He took a sip of tea and continued, "Moongaze and Zhaojing will not be poorly treated in this matter. Zhaojing has only just reached the Purple Mansion Realm, and his divine arts are still developing. He's one of ours. When we ask him to act, he won't be fighting alone."

Li Jiangqian bowed again. "Thank you, Daoist Master. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition protects Jiangnan, and we are humbled to live under its radiance. I will convey your message with the utmost care and await our ancestor's command."

Kui Qi grunted his assent. Seeing that the man was in a good mood, Li Jiangqian pressed his advantage.

"However, the situation in Jiangbei involves many factions, and Daoist Master Zhu Gong has already retreated after being wounded. Without a Daoist Master of your stature overseeing things, I fear there could be delays..."

"Jiangbei..."

Moongaze Lake was situated right on the river, far closer than the distant Great Xiukui Monastery in the south. Their concern for Jiangbei was natural. Kui Qi paused for a moment before speaking.

"You need not worry about that. They won't cross the river. It's just a few Children of Destiny that have been drawn out. If they had been born in the south, it might have been trouble for you. Before Zhaojing returned, you would have had reason to worry. But now that he's back, at worst, he can just tear open the Great Void and crush them with a single finger."

"Although the south is also eager to get its hands on these Children of Destiny, Tinglan and Ning Wan have both gone north. Who could possibly find them faster than your clan?"

A sense of stability settled in Li Jiangqian's heart. He bowed once more. Kui Qi then rose, his gaze turning thoughtful as he stared at the rain clouds.

'Since these Buddhist cultivators are stirring up trouble, there's no need to show mercy,' he thought. 'I'll return to the monastery to retrieve another spiritual artifact, then head to Tongmo and Yuyang. After that, I'll pay a visit to my friend, Daoist Master Lingmei.'

The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had such profound reserves and vast connections that even the Way of Emptiness only dared to stall their two Daoist Masters, not make a fatal move. Kui Qi had nothing to fear. He looked down and said, "When Daoist Master Zhaojing returns, please ask him to wait for me by the lake. If he grows impatient, he can come find me at the Xiukui Monastery."

With those words, Kui Qi's form dissolved and vanished. The two left behind remained prostrate for a long while before rising. Li Jiangqian shook out his robes, returned to the main hall, and waved a hand. Chen Yang took the hint and discreetly withdrew.

"So it really is the Buddhist cultivators..."

He stood in silence for a moment as footsteps approached from the sides. Li Xuanxuan had received word earlier and was already waiting in a side hall. He now strode forward.

Li Jiangqian frowned. "Old Master, Daoist Master Kui Qi said... the one who killed Lord Xuanfeng was Maha Taixi. Have you ever heard of this name?"

At the mention of Li Xuanfeng, the old man started, then stroked his beard. "I only heard... it was a purple-black treasure alms bowl."

Li Jiangqian let out a breath, finally able to relax. He briefly explained the situation, settled into the main seat, and shook his head. "In any case, with the Daoist Master returning, we won't have to live on edge anymore. Itâ€™s not our place, as Foundation Establishment cultivators, to be scheming about the affairs of Purple Mansion experts. With him here, all our plans will have a true master..."

Li Xuanxuan's expression was still tinged with worry, but Li Jiangqian was visibly more at ease. "The Great Void is vast. The journey back from the Eastern Sea could take half a day or a full day, but not much longer. Please summon our sisters and elders. We shall prepare to kneel and welcome his return in this hall."

"As it should be."

Li Xuanxuan had also come to terms with it. Setting all else aside, the prospect of seeing Li Ximing after so many years brought a genuine smile to the old man's face. He shook his head with a helpless sigh. "Zhouming has been confined for so long, it's been torture for him. Once things are settled, we can finally let him out."

"Indeed," Li Jiangqian agreed with a smile, his mind already racing.

'The annual sacrificial rites are also approaching. If the Daoist Master returns and can set up the great formation, we won't have to go through such an ordeal this time.'

But just as the orders were being sent out, Qu Bushi unexpectedly arrived in the hall. He first bowed to Li Xuanxuan before reporting respectfully, "Patriarch, the Capital immortals Dao marketplace was attacked. Its defensive formations were shattered. The Guan Clan lost three direct descendants and suffered heavy losses. Cultivators of all levels were injured. The guardian of the market, Song Yunbai, is severely wounded and missing."

Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow. "Such heavy losses? Who did they fight?"

"A group of demonic cultivators," Qu Bushi said deferentially. "It's related to the demonic disciple from before; he was among them. Our sources in the north say the leader is incredibly powerful, at the very peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Even Guan Gongxiao was at a slight disadvantage against him... It was a surprise attack. By the time the Capital immortals Dao forces arrived, the demonic cultivators were already retreating."

"While the Capital immortals Dao's losses weren't catastrophic, their morale is shattered. The entire sect is gripped with anxiety."

"Demonic cultivators," Li Jiangqian murmured, frowning in confusion.

Qu Bushi lowered his voice. "It is said the demonic cultivator refined a blood-light treasure mirror with his own life force. Its power is astounding, and it's suspected to be an ancient Dharma tool. The masters in the north sent a warning, telling us to be wary of the Wilderness."

Guan Gongxiao wasn't being kind. His message was a warning that they shared the same fate. But with Li Ximing's return, the Li Clan's position would be secure. Li Jiangqian replied casually, "Go back and thank them for the warning. Tell them we will pay close attention to the Wilderness."

Qu Bushi nodded quickly and departed. As the hall doors opened, more people began to file in.

The news of Li Ximing's return had not been widely announced. Only the core members of the direct lineage had been summoned. If Li Ximing failed to return as expected, it would be an even greater disaster. For this reason, not even Zhouming was allowed to come and greet him.

As dusk settled, spirit lamps were lit, casting a warm glow. Everyone waited in silence. Li Minggong stood solemnly before the hall, the flickering light playing across her face, making her features shift between light and shadow.

They waited late into the night. Finally, a soft, gentle radiance emerged from the deep darkness over the lake. In the utter silence, the ethereal light shimmered and transformed, coalescing into the figure of a man in platinum Daoist robes.

The man had refined features and a medium build. In the center of his brow, a point of Profound Light pulsed with brilliance. His hands were clasped behind his back, and he exuded no overwhelming aura. Instead, as he landed before the hall, he seemed to let out a quiet sigh of relief.

Everyone immediately dropped to their knees, their voices united in a chorus of reverence.

"We pay our respects to the Daoist Master!"

The Daoist Master walked slowly up the steps. He first helped Li Xuanxuan to his feet and had the old man seated before taking the main seat himself. His eyes scanned the room, as if checking for missing faces. He looked at Li Jiangqian, then studied Li Que'wan, and sighed with emotion.

"You two siblings have reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. It seems like only yesterday you were still at Qi Refining, and now you have become pillars of our clan."

The two bowed to him. As the radiant light of the Bright Yang shone down, everyone felt the very ground beneath their feet grow more solid.

The Li Clan was only truly an Immortal Clan of the Purple Mansion Realm when Li Ximing was present at the lake. His presence instilled confidence from top to bottom. Yesterday, they might have been consumed by worry, but the moment Li Ximing returned, even with just a simple question, a profound sense of security settled over them. The entire atmosphere of the clan shifted.

Only then did Li Ximing ask, "Did you encounter some trouble?"

Years ago, Li Ximing had made a pact with Zhouwei, leaving behind several jade talismans, each with a different meaning. Although the one used today was merely a summons for his return, Li Ximing's heart was fraught with worry.

The moment he received the message, he had rushed back without pause, traveling nonstop through the Great Void day and night. Before he even reached the lake, he had used the Immortal Mirror to assess the situation. Only when he saw everyone waiting safely did he relax and reveal himself.

In response to his question, Li Jiangqian stepped forward from the crowd and bowed.

"Daoist Master Tinglan and Daoist Master Qiuhu have gone missing. The Northern Buddhists have made a move. It was a Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Monastery of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition who requested that we summon you back for aid."

"Ning Wan reached the Purple Mansion Realm!" Li Ximing exclaimed in mild surprise, before his brow furrowed in thought. "Tinglan is missing..."

Tinglan had been quite helpful to him during his time overseas and had shown intent to protect the Li Clan during his absence. While the debt wasn't immense, Li Ximing still coveted the World's Radiance in her possession. For now, he only asked, "The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is so venerable. Why would they need my help? To think they would summon me back... Who is the enemy we are to face?"

Li Jiangqian recounted the events in detail. Li Ximing stroked his beard, listening in silence before sighing. "Tinglan, Qiuhu... both are friends of our clan. With Kui Qi making such a request, do I have any reason to refuse? Our home faces Jiangbei and has Jiangnan at its back; we cannot afford to offend the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... It's no wonder you called me back."

He considered the situation. Amidst the helplessness, his eyes gleamed with a faint light as a realization dawned in his mind.

'This is a fateful opportunity to obtain the World's Radiance... The key isn't Kui Qi, but Tinglan and Qiuhu. This is a chance to earn gratitude from three sides at once.'

'No matter how powerful the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is, they have countless trump cards. How could a Daoist tradition left by a True Monarch not have one or two Golden Core-level methods? Immortal cultivators are not Buddhist cultivators. As long as I can ensure a safe retreat and avoid bringing too much trouble upon myself, the potential rewards of this venture are immense...'

He glanced at Li Xuanxuan and declared, "We must remember the grudge of our ancestors. Maha Taixi is now a mortal enemy of our clan. The karmic ties with the eighteen Buddhist Master Monks have been forged, and they can never be erased. Either our clan beats him back to the north, and one day eliminates him entirely, or he will be the death of me. Of this, there is no doubt."

"Furthermore, with my existing relationship with Tinglan and Qiuhu, it's not surprising that he would seek me out."

As he quietly contemplated, Li Jiangqian bowed and said in a low voice, "Precisely. As I see it, this is not a bad thing..."

"Maha Taixi is our enemy. Our clan alone can neither withstand his attacks nor hope to destroy him. And he is not alone in the Way of Emptiness's paradise; there is still Zhelu behind him. The loss of the eighteen Buddhist Master Monks was a blow to the Way of Emptiness. While Zhelu's hatred for our clan may not be as deep as Maha Taixi's, the karmic connection remains."

"And the Way of Emptiness is not the Way of Wrath! This issue has been simmering beneath the surface, but if they were to suddenly strike, persecuting our clan to fulfill what the Buddhist cultivators call karmic retribution, and ultimately give rise to a Merciful One... it is a very real possibility."

"The current situation in the north is a golden opportunityâ€”a chance to tie our clan's feud with the Way of Emptiness to the great tree that is the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition!"

At these words, several people nodded in contemplation. Li Que'wan spoke thoughtfully, "Brother, you mean... if we can heavily wound Maha Taixi this time, this new conflict will overshadow old grievances, intensify the friction between the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and the Way of Emptiness, and solidify our relationships with Purple Smoke and the Ning family. This would be extremely advantageous."

"Exactly!" Li Jiangqian bowed. "If the Daoist Master had not returned this time, we would be facing an aggressive Way of Emptiness from the north while having offended the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition in the south, destroying friendships on multiple fronts. How could our clan possibly stand independently in Jiangnan after that?"

"What's more, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is proud, and the Great Xiukui Monastery is aloof. Once this matter is concluded, should we face retaliation from the Way of Emptiness, we will have a legitimate reason to ask the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition for help! And when Father achieves his breakthrough, our status will be even more secure!"

Despite Qian Lizi's earnest pleas in the past, Li Jiangqian had remained unmoved. Yet, with just a few words from Kui Qi, he dared to summon Li Ximing back. He clearly had his own calculations.

Li Ximing simply stroked his chin and nodded, thinking, 'I need not fear the disparity in power, only hidden formations and ambushes. Fortunately, I have the Immortal Mirror. Once I reach the north, a single scan with the mirror should reveal many of the Buddhist cultivators' trump cards and traps.'

"Well said." He smiled and asked, "What impact have these events in Jiangbei had on the clan?"

Seeing his expression, Li Jiangqian knew that Li Ximing had been persuaded. He answered respectfully, "Fortunately, there has been no major impact..."

He reported the recent events in full. Li Ximing listened, nodding repeatedly. "You see," he laughed, "the cultivators of the Capital immortals Dao are no match for our Moongaze clan. Look at the state they've ended up in!"

He praised Li Jiangqian, then his gaze swept over the other clan members.

Li Que'wan had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, so her cultivation wouldn't change for some time. Li Jiangqian had clearly made significant progress and could attempt to reach the mid-stage. Li Minggong had only recently reached the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm.

Crucially, none of the people before him should have taken a Talisman Pill yet.

Li Jiangqian was close to the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. If he could break through and then consume the pill, he should quickly reach the cusp of the late-stage without arousing suspicion.

More importantly... Li Ximing had returned with a Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill.

'What unfortunate timing. Minggong has already broken through to the mid-stage. I'm not sure how this pill should be administered after a breakthrough... I'll have to ask Tinglan later. Giving a pill meant for a Purple Mansion cultivator to someone at the Foundation Establishment Realm will certainly result in a massive surge in cultivation. Add a Talisman Pill to that, and we can first raise one of our own direct descendants to the late-Foundation Establishment Realm!'

If Li Chenghui hadn't died, he would undoubtedly be at the late-stage by now. But as things stood, they could only push Li Minggong forward. Consuming such a powerful pill right after her breakthrough was inherently dangerous, but thankfully, the Talisman Pill had no side effects and could even consolidate her cultivation. By taking that first, she could handle the rapid advancement.

He tapped his fingers on the table, having made his decision. "Then it is settled. Have Cui Jueyin come here. He will accompany me to the Great Xiukui Monastery to see how many people Kui Qi can muster. The rest of you, do not leak the news of my return. For now, we will wait and observe."
