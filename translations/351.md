# Chapter 425: News From The Yu Family

Li Qinghong, having waited for some time at the northern peak of the Yuan Family's Mushroom Forest Plain, was met by their descendant. Intimidated by Li Qinghong's formidable presence, the young representative barely dared to speak and instead stayed in one corner like a timid quail.

For Li Qinghong, delivering Spirit Stones to Yuan Huyuan was just an ordinary trip. However, the mirror that was in her chest pocket stirred slightly. Lu Jiangxian extended his divine sense outward, covering the entire northern expanse of the Mushroom Forest Plain.

He scanned the area with his divine sense, revealing various immortal peaks. Most were occupied by minor Embryonic Breathing Realm clans under the Yuan Family's control. Although the family's main peak was away from here, Lu Jiangxian still managed to detect over ten cultivation techniques.

"Secret notes... One set of alchemy and one set of forging... Cultivation techniques... seven Embryonic Breathing, five Qi Cultivation, and two Foundation Establishment realms..." he murmured.

The Mushroom Forest Plain, a region controlled by major clans for centuries, had a more detailed categorization of cultivation methods compared to Moongaze Lake.

While Moongaze Lake's methods were either for Embryonic Breathing or Foundation Establishment realms, Mushroom Forest Plain included a division between Qi Cultivation and Foundation Establishment realms. This division was believed to be a strategic measure employed by the Yuan Family to maintain control over the minor clans under their rule.

Lu Jiangxian set aside the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation techniques for future study and began to examine the two Foundation Establishment Realm techniques.

A Grade Three manual, Azure River Seeking Source Technique, and a Grade Four manual, Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique...

The Azure River Seeking Source Technique, which could form the Dao foundation Grieving River Departure, was the Dao Partner of Boundless Ocean. Practiced by both the Xiao and Yuan families, it was regarded as a decent and somewhat miraculous method of cultivation.

Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique was a Grade Four qi gathering method. Due to changes in the natural world, it had become obsolete. It appeared to be a remnant from a former immortal sect in the south that required the Long Marcing Pheasant Flame spiritual qi.

"The Yuan Family has quite a number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators on their territory. All of them practice various techniques and utilize the unique aspects of their immortal foundations to develop numerous cultivation sites..."

From the various immortal peaks and their treasures, Lu Jiangxian acknowledged that these established clans, with over a hundred years of history, possess considerable hidden treasures. In contrast, the Li Family, still on the rise, had much to catch up on.

As Lu Jiangxian scanned the immortal caves and fire veins on each immortal peak, he nodded in quiet approval. These established prestigious clans with over a century of history had indeed amassed considerable wealth and hidden treasures. In contrast, the Li Family, which had only recently risen to prominence, still had much to do.

Satisfied with his findings, Lu Jiangxian retracted his divine sense into the mirror. As Li Qinghong drew closer to the Li Residence, his view of Moongaze Lake slowly grew clearer.

"It seems the devil cultivators are assaulting all of Moongaze Lake..."

The shores of Moongaze Lake were shrouded in a blood-red light, which also extended to the territories governed by the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of Mount Yue and Daoist He. Despite the ominous glow, these cultivators made no response but continued their silent cultivation on the mountains.

"It appears that the devil plague is either linked to these Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators or they have been warned... The Azure Pond Sect must be planning something big with all these devil cultivators running amok in the region..."

————

Milin Prefecture was a fertile region with few mountains and forests, featuring only eight or nine small peaks. Five among them had the strongest earth veins that had the richest spiritual energy. The mountains were peppered with many cave dwellings, and most visitors were young cultivators in the early stages of the Embryonic Breathing or Qi Cultivation realms.

The usually bustling prefecture was now desolate. Mana light clashed with devil qi and blood qi in the sky, causing thunderous roars. Jade Smoke Mountain, the dharma artifact, flew here and there, causing loud cries of pain in its wake.

Although the Yu Family had inherited the Jiang Family's legacy, they lacked a competent cultivation technique. The Jiang Family's ancestral secret techniques had long been lost, leaving only a collection of undecipherable jade slips. The Yu Family must rely solely on their dharma artifacts to fend off enemies.

Yu Mugao, observing the dwindling number of his clansmen, assessed the situation. With only six devil cultivators left, he knew they would not be able to breach their family's grand formation.

"There's no need to waste any more time. Disengage and return to the formation!" he commanded.

Yu Mugao was now a late-stage Qi Cultivator and the strongest in his clan. Although he was not a particularly good fighter, having the Jade Smoke Mountain dharma artifact in his possession significantly enhanced his combat capabilities.

With loyal clan members and external cultivators he had personally trained, Yu Mugao faced the demon cultivators. They charged from all directions, exploiting the demons' weaknesses to defeat them one by one. Despite being at a disadvantage in terms of strength, they fought with fierce determination and resolve.

Having expended two Foundation Establishment Realm talismans, Yu Mugao observed that most of the devil cultivators had begun to retreat with severe injuries. With the majority of cities and counties in Milin Prefecture saved, he deemed it unwise to continue fighting and decided to withdraw, heading toward the mountain.

Just as he was about to land in the mountains, his path was blocked by the formation that had just been activated. His loyal clan members behind him began to panic as Yu Mugao froze in his spot.

The formation plate at home has my seal... Why can't I enter the formation?!

His heart pounded with dread. "Open the formation at once!" he demanded urgently.

Yu Mugao's children were among the cultivators guarding the mountain. His seventh and youngest son, Yu Chengyi, recognized his father's voice instantly. He jumped in surprise and was about to open the formation when he was halted. Several elders intervened, holding the formation plate.

"The Family Head's spiritual sense seal is on this plate... There's no reason why he can't open the formation! That must be a devil cultivator impostor!" they said.

Yu Chengyi had always been timid. He hesitated and was quickly overpowered by the authoritative words of his elders. Not only did he not open the formation, but he also did not dare snatch the formation plate from their hands.

Outside, Yu Mugao's voice grew more urgent as he demanded, "Chengyi, open the formation right now!"

The voice was isolated outside the formation. Although Yu Mugao could not see the elders inside the formation, he immediately understood the situation.

To think I'd actually perish at the hands of those juniors! he thought in anguish.

Meanwhile, inside the formation...

Smoke billowed outside and the air was filled with the haunting echoes of miserable screams. The Yu Family's cultivators inside the formation shivered as they watched the man standing at the edge of the formation.

One of them asked nervously, "Master Lu, what should we do...?"

The guest cultivator observed the bloodshed outside with a smirk and reassured them with a smile, "No need to worry... The devil cultivators can't breach the formation. Just wait it out. The situation will resolve itself."

The group huddled in the mountains and waited for several hours. Eventually, the black devil qi began to dissipate, and everything outside the formation soon became visible. One of the Yu Family members came forward and said, "Master Lu, please go out and assess the situation!"

Master Lu nodded. He rode the wind and flew out of the formation to search among the fallen bodies on the ground for a while. Eventually, a big smile appeared on his face. He drew his sword and severed the head of a corpse on the ground, laughing as he made a loud proclamation.

"Rejoice, elders! Yu Mugao is dead!"

He raised the severed head high above his head as if it were a trophy and declared, "The tyrannical lord is dead! The officials and nobles in the prefecture no longer need to live under his oppressive rule! Congratulations, elders!"

Yu Chengyi's face immediately paled as he slumped to the ground, finally realizing the severity of the situation. However, no one paid him any further attention. Amidst the mixed emotions of the crowd, someone called out, "Present the head quickly!"

Another voice shouted in excitement, "Where is the jade seal? Where is his Jade Smoke Mountain?"

Jade Smoke Mountain was a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact that had gained sentience. Only members of the Yu Family's direct lineage could wield it effectively; for anyone else, the jade seal would be as unyielding as a real mountain. Since these demon cultivators were only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, it was unlikely they could take it away.

Master Lu quickly returned with the severed head and handed it to that elder.

"The Jade Smoke Mountain is too heavy for me to lift. It is still at the foot of the mountain," he informed.

The elder examined the severed head closely. Yu Mugao, now over eighty years old, had graying hair and his cunning eyes were slightly open. His hair and beard was long, and his face was all bruised and bloodied from the devil cultivator's attacks.

Those eyes locked onto the elder's greedy and gleeful gaze, causing the elder to gasp and throw Yu Mugao's head away, his face paling in shock.

Another member of the group picked up the head, still unable to believe that Yu Mugao was truly dead. The elders exchanged uneasy glances, and one of them spoke with a tremble in his voice, "Although this man was cruel and unkind, he wasn't much of a fighter... It was no surprise he got killed..."

"Yes, but... Yu Muxian is still in the sect. I-If... If he finds out that we have secretly erased the seal from the formation plate... Master Lu! What should we do now?!"

It turned out that several of the elders were brothers of Yu Xiaogui. During his lifetime, Yu Xiaogui had feared that his eldest son, Yu Mugao, might slaughter the clan after his death, so he used various means to secretly protect them.

Yu Mugao had been aware of this but was concerned that any rash actions might expose news of Yu Xiaogui's death. He had planned to frame and eliminate them one by one.

However, these elders were shrewd and had been feigning ignorance.

Yu Mugao did not anticipate encountering devil cultivators, and everyone was rescued by guest cultivator Lu. His descendants, being too weak to make decisive moves, ended up getting him killed.

Master Lu shook his head and replied, "Yu Mugao died due to the devil plague... Yu Muxian won't investigate with a Clarity Talisman. As long as we hold our ground, we can manage this situation!"

The elder nodded silently, whispering, "We'll put our trust in you, Master Lu!"

The guest cultivator nodded with a smile.

The old man turned around and addressed the terrified crowd.

"With Yu Mugao dead, all his rules are nullified. We'll abolish his public fields, inspections, collective punishments, and commercial taxes... We'll restore the clan's tribute system, the clan slaves... All laws enacted by Yu Mugao will be revoked in favor of the ancient clan system!"

Instantly, the Yu Family members erupted in joy and cheers. Yu Mugao's head, now fallen on the ground, lay in the rain, his beard and hair drenched and matted.

The chorus of voices chanted, "Remove the tyrants and restore the clan system!"

The face that had been drained white due to devil cultivation qi turning dull, now lying alone under the rain, eerily resembled An Jingming's head that had been preserved with a spell for decades in the Yu Family's vault.

————

Li Yuanping sat at the high seat, now nearing thirty with gray sideburns that he no longer bothered to dye. People on Mount Dali usually got gray hair at thirty and passed away at fifty. Therefore, Li Yuanping could now be referred to as an Old Master.

The storage pouches left behind by the two devil cultivators were no ordinary items. Li Yuanping had them exchanged for three pouches suitable for the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, and with the remaining twenty-plus Spirit Stones added to the family's vault, his mood had lightened considerably.

The newly acquired storage pouches were given to the brothers from the An Family and the orphan from the Tian Family, as a gesture to win over their favor.

He was currently preparing for the upcoming tribute submission. He had learned that Eldest Senior Brother Yu Su from Yuanwu Peak, notorious for his greed and audacity, would be collecting the tributes this time. As such, it was essential to prepare a bribe.

While he listed down all the items that needed to be prepared, someone entered the hall and presented a letter.

"Family Head! A report from our Yu Family's spy!"

Li Yuanping skimmed through the letter. His eyes widened in disbelief as he read it again, more carefully this time.

He then exclaimed, "Yu Mugao is dead?! Is this true? What kind of scheme is that person plotting now?"

He pondered for a moment, realizing that the current situation of the three families made it unlikely that the Yu Family would fake a death—it would only cause unnecessary turmoil.

The three families had an agreement before. The Li Family moving north at this time would only provoke trouble.

On the other hand, the Yu Family, with its vast territory, had been plagued by even more devil cultivators. Yu Mugao's death seemed plausible under the circumstances.

"Send someone to investigate further," he instructed.

Still feeling uneasy, Li Yuanping sent another person to confirm the news. After a moment, he put down his brush, a muffled laugh escaping his lips. He turned to those around him, joyfully announcing, "With one less starving wolf at my side, I can finally sleep in peace!"

As he held the small letter, Li Yuanjiao descended into the front yard. He had been accumulating progress all this while and spent only several days breaking through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Yuanping rose from his seat and greeted him with a smile.

"Big Brother, take a look at this!" he exclaimed gleefully.

Li Yuanjiao nodded and read the letter carefully. He exhaled deeply, both relieved and satisfied.
𝑓𝓇𝘦ℯ𝘸𝘦𝑏𝓃𝑜𝘷ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂

"I guess he was fortunate to die an easy death," he commented.

Li Yuanjiao and his siblings still harbored resentment toward the Yu Family due to Li Yuanxiu's death. They had always wished so badly to end that cunning pair of father and son from the Yu Family. Yu Xiaogui had been slain by Li Tongya, who passed away shortly after that. Now that Yu Mugao had been killed in the devil plague, they could finally have peace of mind.

Li Yuanping raised his head and murmured, "Considering all the enemies of my family, even though Yu Mugao might not compare to the likes of Jianixi, he was still a formidable figure... Now that he is dead, his lifelong good governance and clan system has been in vain. The Yu Family can no longer compete with my family for supremacy... This is a blessing for my Li Family!"

Li Yuanjiao chuckled in response.

"The Yu Family spent a century usurping Jiang's territory, I still remember when they hosted a banquet and invited all the families to impose tributes on them. It has only been eighty years since then, and now their influence has crumbled. Even the last beam of their roof has been broken."

"Don't forget about Yu Mujian... We still haven't heard any news about him, so it's unclear whether he's alive or dead," Li Yuanping reminded him.

As the two brothers enjoyed their conversation, Dou Yi approached and reported, "Family Head! With Yu Mugao dead, their elder, Yu Xiaomian, is supporting Yu Chengyi, the seventh heir, as their new leader. Meanwhile, the other peaks, controlled by Yu Mugao's other descendants, have split into four factions. The situation is currently at a standstill."

Li Yuanping considered this information thoughtfully but could only say, "It's a pity that Yu Muxian's oath prevents us from intervening in the Yu Family's affairs or entering their territory... Otherwise, we could take advantage of this situation to expand north and annex half of the Yu Family's land."

"We might not be able to annex it directly, but we could certainly do something about it..." Li Yuanjiao suggested.

Li Yuanping then took the letter presented by Dou Yi and said, "All four regions around the lake have been struck by the devil plague, and the Fei Family has activated their Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation. Without any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators among the devil cultivators, they were unable to breach it and quickly withdrew."

As the two brothers were deep in discussion, a commotion erupted in the front hall. Two young Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators hurried in with tears staining their cheeks. They rushed forward and fell to their knees as they cried out, "Please... save our families!"

These cultivators were from the Rui and Pu families on the eastern shore, both of which paid tribute to the Li Family. They had come to the Li Family to cultivate spirit fields and were now pleading desperately.

"Family Head, the families on the eastern shore are in utter chaos! Many devil cultivators of the Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realms are running amok there... We've exhausted all our means of seeking help. Please, we beg the main family to save our families...!"

Li Yuanping and Li Yuanjiao exchanged a glance, their faces lighting up with sudden delight. Their eyes were drawn to the densely packed families on the map.

"Families on the eastern shore!"

These Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realm devil cultivators are easy prey... We could use this opportunity to gather several Embryonic Breathing Realm families and increase the tribute we receive. It's a perfect chance to kill two birds with one stone!
