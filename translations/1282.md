# Chapter 1282: The Knack

When Xiao Chuting emerged from the great hall, the night was already fading. A continuous stretch of gold shimmered on the distant water's surface, its waves sparkling. The morning glow crept along the ground, lying in wait.

The old man stood before the hall, gazing on without a word.

Li Zhouwei stood quietly behind him, his golden eyes seeming to hold a thousand unspoken words, yet he remained silent.

The two stood thus in silence, until at last King Wei spoke softly.

"The Lingyu legacy… does Senior Xiao have a plan? Do you know… when it will be opened?"

The old man adjusted his straw hat and said,

"This old man already possesses five divine abilities. Its opening and closing are entirely at my discretion. As long as I am willing, I can go to Badger Prefecture this very moment and open it."

The Golden Feather Sect had plotted for many years, yet it seemed they had not wrested the initiative from Xiao Chuting. For a millennium, those who could get the better of the Golden Feather Sect were few and far between. Yet this old man seemed unfazed, stating as if it were only natural.

"But without this Daoist Master, that little friend Su will be unable to touch the Great Ling River."

Li Zhouwei asked, "The Great Ling River?"

Xiao Chuting shook his head and said,

"It was originally the grotto-heaven of the Great Ling Kingdom. After the True Monarch fell, the grotto-heaven was on the verge of collapse when it was secured by a great divine ability user of the Chen Clan who wielded Mansion Water, and established in Badger Prefecture."

"A river was left behind in this place, one transformed by the divine ability of ancient Pit Water. It is rumored to still contain the inheritance left by the True Monarch of ancient Pit Water."

Even someone as composed as Xiao Chuting now wore a somber expression as he spoke of this. Li Zhouwei nodded to himself.

'No wonder…'

'No wonder Golden Oneness intended to interfere…'

But looking back now, the interference from Golden Oneness seemed ambiguous. It was still unknown whether the Zhang family was unwilling to see Xiao Chuting attain the Dao, or unwilling to give the Dragon-kin and the Yue Cultivating Sect an opportunity to join forces and slay the Pit Water True Monarch.

Li Zhouwei pondered the position of Golden Oneness and asked in a low voice,

"Ancient Pit Water… did it have a designation?"

"Naturally, it did."

Xiao Chuting, however, spoke with sorrow,

"Pit and Li are a pair of opposites. Li corresponds to heavy nets, while Pit corresponds to practicing peril. The original name of Pit Water should have been 'Peril-Practicing Pit Water of the Sunken Way,' representing water flowing in channels and hollows, the course of a hundred rivers moving through the earth."

"The current Pit Water is the 'Primodial (Jiazi) Pit Water of a Thousand Reticences.' The first among all things is denoted Jia, used here to represent overflowing water crowning orthodox nature. To be nimble yet silent is Reticence, which is its intrinsic nature. Vastness is contained within, leading to convergence, hence Zi. When water is overabundant, it overflows, streaming east, west, north, and south, thus it is called 'Migration.' Water that does not follow its channel, but reverses and juts out like a dyke, is called 'Pathway'… together, these form 'Thousand.'"

His current Dao-Profundity was simply too high; with just a few words, the essence of Pit Water began to surge around them. He said faintly,

"In truth, the locus of Pit Water is subject to great change and has its own meaning. I have a clue or two, but I do not fully grasp them myself. Since King Wei does not cultivate the water virtue, this old man will not elaborate, lest I hinder you—so long as I can obtain that complete ancient Pit Water, it will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the Quest for Gold."

Li Zhouwei chuckled and shook his head.

"Senior's words are not quite right… we are all people verifying the Dao, how could we tire of hearing Daoist lectures? One must accept profound words and gather the strengths of a hundred schools to achieve this one verification!"

In fact, from their brief contact just now, Xiao Chuting already understood that the Dao-Profundity of the King Wei before him was by no means low!

'He is but a little over a hundred years old… how did he attain such profound Dao-Profundity? I fear even some Great Daoist Masters are no match for him… setting aside his cultivation level, even the disciples from the great mountains would likely be unable to possess Dao-Profundity comparable to a Great Daoist Master at the age of one hundred!'

He could have attributed it to the power of the lord of the lake, but what Li Zhouwei had just said about the Purple Mystery made him feel that he had not obtained the Dharma Arts currently in vogue among the direct lineages of the Dao Embryo and Golden Core realms…

'Could it truly be a matter of innate talent?'

He suppressed his doubts and continued with a smile.

"This journey is one of no return, so this old man will not hold anything back. I learned a few tricks from a Daoist friend surnamed Ni, which I have combined with the five manifestations. It serves as a topic for idle chatter, so I can share it with King Wei."

"The orthodoxy of the five manifestations lies not only within, but also in the body of the five virtues. Whether this Pit Water is called 'Peril-Practicing Pit Water of the Sunken Way,' or 'Jiazi Pit Water of a Thousand Reticences,' the profound designation in both cases contains the words Pit Water, brilliant and grand, seated squarely in the center."

"But if you look at Valley Water it is called 'Embryonic Breathing Great Treasury of the Profound Valley.' This profound designation doesn't even contain the word 'water'!"

He saw the thoughtful look on Li Zhouwei's face and smiled.

"Valley Water is the water of reception and storage; naturally, it is hidden away!"

"One can largely extrapolate from this…"

Li Zhouwei's eyes lit up as he nodded.

"Marvelous…"

The meaning behind Xiao Chuting's words was far-reaching.

What did 'extrapolate from this' imply?

Since he had said it, the profound designation of a Fruition Attainment could be altered by a great divine ability user. If one obtained a profound designation that, upon analysis, did not conform to this pattern, then the Fruition Attainment must have been altered!

For instance, the profound designation of Reflecting Metal had surely been changed. It was called 'Golden Oneness Taiyuan of Highest Azure Nature,' which was frankly startling—the one presiding within was no longer Reflecting Metal, but He, Taiyuan…

What kind of divine ability was this?

For Xiao Chuting to call this a small knack was pure modesty; this was an exceedingly profound yet convenient method for comprehending the Dao!

"This junior has been enlightened!"

He had gained a great deal. After organizing his thoughts, he looked at the old man with a burning gaze, who smiled in embarrassment and said,

"Those Daoist lectures on the Purple Mystery were taught to me by a senior when I possessed four divine abilities. After just one trip to the lake, King Wei has drained me of the few true teachings I've managed to scrape together over the years through chance and fortune…"

Li Zhouwei could only shake his head in regret, his heart clear. He immediately changed the subject.

"Since Senior can decide when to attain the Dao, you possess the element of surprise. How about we set a limit of four years?"

According to Li Zhouwei's calculations, four years was the perfect amount of time. And going by the conventions of breakthroughs in the Purple Mansion Realm, if Jiang Yan failed this time, four years would be nowhere near enough for a second attempt. As for Wei Xuanyin, if he was relying on Qi from Yehui to break through, he would inevitably be a step slower without the aid of Talisman Qi.

"Four years."

Xiao Chuting nodded, seemingly calculating the time. He left a jade talisman for Li Zhouwei, and only then did he see Li Ximing arrive with Xiao Yuansi. The old man bowed before the hall, but then Xiao Chuting spoke unexpectedly.

"Yuansi, you will remain here on the lake."

At these words, Xiao Yuansi froze, a hint of alarm in his eyes.

"Ancestor… what is the meaning of this…"

Xiao Chuting smiled and shook his head, speaking softly,

"I will be returning to Jiangnan to visit the various houses, and I will not be back in the Northern Sea for several years. You are getting on in years as well; it is a good opportunity to reminisce here. There is no need for you to be jostled about following me."

Xiao Yuansi could only lower his head in assent. Li Ximing seemed to understand something and said with a smile,

"Indeed. The scenery on the lake is lovely. Let Martial Uncle rest well."

Li Zhouwei had been observing quietly the entire time, a complex expression faintly visible in his eyes.

'The Xiao Clan can still look to Moongaze Lake for protection, and Xiao Chuting specially mentioned the Wu Clan to me, likely to protect their remaining lineage in Jiangnan. But when the day of my own Dao verification arrives, who can the Li Clan turn to for protection…'

His thoughts were dark. The old man beside him seemed to sense it, turned, and said:

"King Wei! This Xiao will verify the Dao first…"

A faint smile flickered in the old man's eyes.

"May there come a time when we hold gold and ascend to our thrones, to discuss the Dao beyond the heavens."

…

Crimson flames churned, and purple smoke lingered.

The radiance of the Supreme Yang shimmered, and purple qi continuously reverberated within the cave. A red-robed Daoist stood with his hands clasped behind him, vermilion light flashing in his eyes where faint golden runes flowed. His gaze was fixed on the great earthfire formation before him.

Within the eye of the formation, baleful qi converged, a swirl of black and red holding aloft a single flame.

This fire was a brilliant red overall, its outer edges blazing with faint crimson patterns, while its core was white with flashes of gold. The colors were vivid.

This was the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire!

This high-level cultivator of True Fire stood before the dancing flame, head bowed in contemplation, silent for a long time. The purple qi beside him swirled, revealing a figure in a golden robe. Daoist Master Tianhuo sat to the side, chin in hand, lost in thought. After a long while, he heard the Great Daoist Master speak,

"Is there any news from Azure Revolution Heaven?"

Tianhuo shook his head, saying bitterly:

"Ever since the affair with Li Que'wan, no further orders have been issued from the Golden Book. The lords are all watching closely. As soon as there is news, it will surely be passed along…"

Tianque, who was the Great Daoist Master, pondered for a moment and said,

"If there is none, then so be it."

A faint smile still touched his face.

"Since the True Monarch has not spoken, it means I am to manage on my own. The lord has his own reasons."

Tianhuo said with regret,

"It's a pity Martial Cousin Qiushui is in seclusion. Otherwise, we could have asked for her guidance. With her Dao-Profundity, one word from her is worth more than a hundred from those old-timers in Azure Revolution Heaven…"

Tianque said faintly,

"I have already asked her. She was the one who guided me regarding the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire."

"The lineage of 'Nurturing True Fire in the Connate' declined far earlier than the water virtue. Their number has been few throughout the ages. Its last period of prosperity was under the stewardship of the Encompassing Profoundity Sect. Perhaps something happened during the war between immortals and demons…"

"But True Fire is gestating, and all auxiliary paths rejoice in it, thus they do not reject it. The Auxiliary Position is responsive. It is said to be that Connate Profound-Cycle True Monarch. If I can just figure out why he is still able to respond, I might find a way to verify the auxiliary path…"

Tianhuo frowned.

"Connate Profound-Cycle Fire-Virtue True Monarch?"

Tianque nodded with a smile.

"They are just strict in Azure Revolution Heaven. Outside, people do not typically say 'fire virtue.' Just like the Valley Water Matriarch, who ought to be called the Marvelous Dao Transformation Water-Virtue True Monarch…"

The young man, Tianhuo, laughed and said,

"That is only natural. According to ancient custom, those who verified the Dao by upholding the orthodoxy of the five virtues, whether they achieved Fruition or an Auxiliary position, liked to add Water Virtue or Fire Virtue to their titles. In Azure Revolution Heaven, they add these two for fear that we forget. Outside, they omit these two for fear that others remember. How can this be called mere strictness?"

"Diligently erect Dao barriers, cautiously set personal obstacles… only then can one advance and retreat with measure."

He spoke with casual grace, but Tianque sighed in frustration. Facing this young master, he seemed less stern.

"Everyone has their Dao barriers, but how many can truly be masters of destiny? I actually envy people like Xiao Chuting and Li Zhouwei… I only resent having no opportunity to risk my life."

"Even the lord cannot know the foundation of a True Monarch's destiny, so how could I? I can only try my luck and hope for a moment of enlightenment."

As the two were conversing, Zhang Duanyan entered from outside the cave. She bowed and reminded them in a low voice,

"Daoist Masters, Xiao Chuting has arrived at Moongaze Lake."

Tianque had just mentioned him. At these words, he spun around. Tianhuo's eyes lit up even more as he asked in a low voice,

"Oh? Have his divine abilities been perfected?"

"It is said… he has five divine abilities."

This, however, made Tianque frown.

"Then they are not perfected. It must be difficult for him. At such an advanced age, he no longer has time to cultivate another."

This Great Daoist Master seemed to hold some goodwill for Xiao Chuting, remarking casually,

"If he had managed to obtain a sixth divine ability, he might have had a chance."

As a man who also harbored ambitions of verifying the Dao, he could not help but sigh.

"He is quite formidable. First, he followed the will of the Underworld, climbing aboard the southern factions' ship from the moment he destroyed the Emperor's Mandate and riding the winds ever since. Now, he has attached himself to that legendary figure from Cangzhou. If he truly succeeds one day, his name will be passed down for a hundred generations."

Tianhuo, however, shook his head strangely.

"It must be five divine abilities. Otherwise, why would he need to use the Great Ling River?"

Seeing the two begin to chat idly, Zhang Duanyan said with some unease,

"But… since he has gone personally, given the characters of the Li Clan, Li Ximing, and the others, they will most likely grant his wish! If that happens, what arrangements should we make…"

Tianhuo and Tianque exchanged a glance, neither seeming particularly worried. The seemingly languid Daoist Master shook his head.

"What else can be done? Xiao Chuting is determined to waste the Great Ling River, and Moongaze Lake is fanning the flames. It is nothing more than an exchange—they will strongly support Xiao Chuting's attainment of the Dao, and in return, the Dragon-kin will help secure a path of retreat for Li Zhouwei in the matter of Bright Yang…"

Tianque frowned.

"Is there any path of retreat left to speak of?"

Interrupted, Tianhuo actually appeared to give it more thought before saying:

"Who knows? The methods of Azure Profoundity can never be measured by common sense. We need not even speak of the Empty Attestation affair. That immortal can hold yin to cross yang, my own lord can borrow Geng for Dui (Reflecting), and after obtaining the immortal scripture, Duanmu Kui dared to seek Fruition through the Four Alike, One Different method. If Li Zhouwei were to execute the Emperor of Wei and demonstrate a Pre-Wu Intercalary Escape, it wouldn't be impossible. Whether he could succeed is another matter, but at least he would possess the Azure Profoundity Qi."

As he spoke, he could not help but laugh, smacking his lips with relish.

"If Li Zhouwei can obtain Bright Yang and then escape from Luoxia with his life, he would be nothing short of a peerless, heaven-blessed talent."

Tianque was unconvinced.

"Whether he can escape depends entirely on whether Luoxia wants to kill him. For now, everything seems amicable, but who's to say they aren't afraid of Moongaze Lake becoming desperate? The affair with the Lesser Yang back then also started with everyone being on friendly terms…"

Tianhuo did not take the bait, instead musing:

"The Great Ling River is the last bastion of ancient Pit Water. Besides this place, there are no other orthodox locations left to attain the Dao through ancient Pit Water. It is the one and only, the final chance for a True Dragon to verify the Dao, or for the Dragon-kin before their failure."

"The order from the grotto-heaven back then was to use all our power to prevent Xiao Chuting from attaining the Dao. Since no new orders have come, we must act, even if it means confronting the Li Clan!"

His gaze sharpened as he looked around, as if seeking their assent. Seeing them both nod, he continued:

"Li Zhouwei has just returned from a great battle. Based on battlefield reports, his Crimson Severing Arrowhead has only just been perfected, so he won't have time to dabble in the Purple Mystery. At most, he's healed some injuries and cultivated a spell art or two. A Great Daoist Master should be sufficient to suppress him."

Tianque understood his meaning and raised his eyebrows in slight surprise.

"One from the grotto-heaven should suffice. Is there a need for me to go personally?"

The young man, Tianhuo, was taken aback, then let out a long sigh.

"Martial Uncle Tianque, you have been in seclusion for too long. You have no idea how formidable the White Qilin is now—he killed Gongsun Bei in the time it takes an incense stick to burn! Gongsun Bei was in the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, and his Dao lineage was countered. How many people could kill him in the span of a single incense stick!"

Tianque considered this for a moment, then shook his head.

"It's not that I can't make the trip, but isn't that an exaggeration? That Li Zhouwei is armed to the teeth with Spiritual Treasures, top-tier Spiritual Artifacts, and the ritual vessels of Great Wei. What did Gongsun Bei have? A couple of tattered items… If he had so much as a single Spiritual Treasure, he would not have been slain in the time it takes an incense stick to burn."

Zhang Duanyan, however, had witnessed the battle from afar and felt a lingering fear.

"He is the White Qilin, after all. Let us hope we do not underestimate our enemy."

Though Tianque had a fiery temper, he was no fool. Seeing that both juniors, who were frequently active in the outside world, had spoken, he immediately grew solemn. He nodded to himself.

"When the time comes, I will bring all my treasures. I will be sure to fight to my heart's content."
