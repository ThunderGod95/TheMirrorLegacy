# Chapter 1130: The Beginning and End Settled

Li Ximing rode the wind all the way back, his heart pounding with anxiety. He only managed to catch his breath after leaving the Fuzhong Sea. He passed through the dense jungles of Poluoduo, looped back from the Southern Sea to the Song State, and only when he saw that familiar, great lake did he finally, truly relax.

'That ghostly thing... thankfully, it didn't latch onto me.'

This realization amplified the joy from his great harvest, setting his mind completely at ease. As he landed in the mountains, he was greeted by an unexpectedly lively scene.

A Daoist Master in green robes sat meditating in a pavilion, a scroll resting on his lap. He stared intently at the text, his fingers pinching together in calculation. Two figures stood beside him: an old man, robed and stroking his beard with a look of contentment, and a young man, clasping a mercury-colored object, his bearing heroic.

Besides Daoist Master Qinghu, who had been invited to guard the area, it was also Xianyao and his disciple, Cheng Qian!

"Fellow Daoists!"

The pair seemed to be looking for Sima Yuanli. Li Ximing offered a smiling greeting. The green-robed Daoist Master immediately rose, studied his expression, and praised him.

"To have a harvest in such a short time... fellow Daoist is truly impressive!"

The Western Sea was distant, after all. Li Ximing had spent months preparing for the journey. Gathering information, refining pills, and setting up his plans all took time. After Li Zhouwei returned, he still had to arrange matters concerning Dao Mian. By the time he had finished with everything and returned, more than a year had passed.

Sima Yuanli clearly had connections in the Western Sea and knew exactly how long it had taken to eliminate that Demon beast. His smile was polite. Li Ximing replied.

"I spent some time handling private affairs. I was worried that if I stayed away too long, there might be trouble in the north again. I'm grateful to the Daoist Master for guarding the lake for my family."

"It was no trouble. Is cultivation not practiced everywhere?"

Sima Yuanli beamed, pressing his hands together.

"King Wei truly struck Qi Lanyan where it hurts. He's far too busy dealing with the accusations to cause any trouble!"

With three Daoist Masters arriving at the mountain gate, Li Ximing couldn't very well leave them standing outside. He led the group inside and they sat among the peaks. Sima Yuanli smiled.

"Congratulations, fellow Daoist! I've also heard of that Shehu. It was said to possess a certain treasure..."

Li Ximing already knew what he was thinking. With a faint smile, he brought his hand out from his sleeve. Resting in his palm was a brilliant, dazzling azure pearl.

It was the Shehu's Upright Wood spirit embryo.

It wasn't that Sima Yuanli lacked a spirit embryo. Although Daoist Master Yuanxiu hadn't been able to predict the date of his breakthrough and left one for him, Sima Yuanli now possessed both Spiritual Artifacts and Spiritual Treasures. Why would he waste effort refining a spirit embryo he looked down upon?

But Li Ximing had seen how crudely this artifact was refined, yet it had still managed to endure for so long against the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire. He knew the material of this Upright Wood spirit embryo was exceptionally rare. As expected, he saw Sima Yuanli's eyes light up.

Sima Yuanli joked,

"If Zhaojing still wants a Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill, I'm afraid I'm truly all out!"

Though spoken in jest, his words made Li Ximing pause. He, too, smiled.

"Daoist Master Qinghu's prediction was spot on. What a pity."

He smiled and said no more, immediately turning his hand and putting the spirit embryo away.

Whether it was for the formation or the cultivation of the two juniors, the Li family still required a massive amount of spiritual resources. But Li Ximing currently had plenty on hand. What was the rush to trade?

'A spirit embryo will degenerate. In five or six years, its value will plummet. But it's still early. The one who should be anxious is Sima Yuanli.'

He paid the pondering Sima Yuanli no mind and turned his gaze. As expected, Cheng Qian was speaking politely.

"Senior... did you happen to see that Demon beast use a treasure basin?"

Sima Yuanli anticipating this wasn't surprising, but Cheng Qian's query was odd. Suspicion rose in Li Ximing's heart, though his face remained pleasant.

"Your information is quite thorough."

Cheng Qian had worked with Li Ximing before and had always been clever and astuteâ€”a truly rare junior. Hearing the comment, he smiled.

"It is not I who is asking, but a friend. He said he is quite interested in the item, but his identity is... special, and he cannot meet with the Shehu to trade. Thus, he has been unable to acquire it."

Li Ximing understood immediately.

'Buddhist cultivators.'

Clearly, the boundaries between the Immortals and Buddhists of the Eastern Sea were not as sharply defined as they were in the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Cheng Qian likely knew many Buddhist cultivators. Li Ximing poured him some tea and said casually,

"It is in my hands. It just depends on what he's willing to offer in trade."

Cheng Qian's lips moved slightly. A voice, guided by a divine ability, floated clearly and decisively into Li Ximing's ear.

'This junior is willing to trade on his behalf. How about two portions of Radiant Spirit-Vessel?'

Li Ximing's heart skipped a beat.

Li Zhouwei had obtained a portion of Radiant Spirit-Vessel from Changxiao Gate back then, and Li Ximing had used it. Its effects were excellent, especially for a cultivator like him. His Dao-Profundity wasn't high, making progress in spell arts exceptionally difficult, and the item had helped immensely. He was tempted, but the two items were not of equal value. He smiled.

"The item is good, but the basin's materials are superb. It's not an even trade. You'd be better off looking for spiritual items of the Radiant Fire or Whole Pill variety."

Nearly all the spoils from Vast Cicada had been poured into Li Zhouwei's weapon. Li Ximing was naturally thinking of future plans. His words weren't just for Cheng Qian; they were also for Daoist Master Qinghu, who sat nearby. At the same time, another calculation ran through Li Ximing's mind.

'This isn't my only option. If a Buddhist cultivator is making inquiries through such a winding path, and Cheng Qian is so decisive he's willing to make the trade himself, the basin's value must be extraordinary. If I don't ask Minghui about it first, won't I be taking a loss for nothing?'

He mused silently. The master and disciple before him, however, showed no signs of leaving. Cheng Qian lowered his brow in thought, but it was Xianyao who unexpectedly spoke.

He seemed to have hesitated for a long time. His expression was somewhat bitter.

"It's quite a coincidence to run into Zhaojing. I've heard of your esteemed clan's great reputation, and I have a few... private words to share. I only fear the Daoist Master will find me long-winded."

Li Ximing gave him a curious glance and nodded for him to continue. The older Daoist Master chose his words carefully.

"Although the Shehu was no powerful figure, it had its reasons for holding its ground. The West Mansion Grotto Sect, and the other Daoist Masters... though they can say nothing, they are deeply unhappy. And those few whose sources of spiritual resources were destroyed must certainly harbor some resentment..."

Li Ximing had expected this. He simply smiled, saying nothing. Xianyao continued.

"I understand the Immortal Clan is short on resources and has just received the Heavenly Nurture Urn from His Majesty, allowing you to fill this gap. But... to travel a thousand li to execute someone with a divine ability, someone with whom you have no prior enmity... this action is simply too severe. It does not earn a good name."

The smile on Li Ximing's face faded slightly. He understood the old man's point. He chuckled.

"Those words lack reason. Old sir, please speak plainly! Back then, the Chi clan used the cultivators of Jiangnan to guard the river, feeding the insatiable maw of the Buddhist cultivators. I never heard anyone speak a word of 'severity'. When the Murong clan swept south, they feasted on blood and perfected their Dao-Profundity, and no one came knocking to question them. I simply assumed that executing a man-eating evil Demon wouldn't earn me a 'severe' reputation. It seems I was mistaken."

His words landed softly, his tone mild, but they held no trace of agreement. A flicker of worry crossed Cheng Qian's eyes. Sima Yuanli kept smiling, as if he'd heard nothing. Xianyao sighed.

"Forgive this old man for saying a few things that are hard to hear. The common folk are common folk. No matter how many, they are just mortals. But a divine ability is a divine ability. Even one is an Immortal. Once that state is achieved, we are all 'fellow Daoists'. Countless commoners die of suffering, but never has one with a divine ability been executed without cause. Since it had already fled to the Western Sea, and you had no quarrel, you should have at least left it some dignity. Killing it is one thing... but why capture it and torture it?"

"If Zhaojing had secretly drawn its blood to nourish a Spiritual Treasure, even if word got out, people would at most praise your methods. But to capture one with a divine ability, to eat its flesh and wear its skin... anyone who hears of it will frown. This time it was a Shehu. Who will it be next time?"

"As for claiming it was a 'man-eating evil Demon' and that you thus had cause to execute it... that is an invitation to chaos."

His face was etched with sorrow. He cupped his hands.

"An evil Demon is inherently evil, but one cannot execute it simply _because_ it is evil. Otherwise, wouldn't every person with a divine ability live in constant fear? Your Li clan holds the banner of the righteous path high; is there anyone you _cannot_ kill? This is the way of the Encompassing Profoundity's Heaven-Governing. It is ill-suited for these times. The world belongs to those who are attaining the Dao. To govern those who have attained the Dao with the foolish notions of commoners... such a path will inevitably lead to ruin. All of history proves this."

Li Ximing narrowed his eyes, listening as Xianyao's voice dropped low.

"My ancestors came from Guanlong and received the grace of Wei. I am not Situ Huo; I cannot simply ignore my forebears. I had to be nosy. If the Daoist Master dislikes what he has heard, then for the sake of a man near death... please spare this old man..."

He bid his farewell, turned, and stepped onto the wind, departing. Cheng Qian, left behind, was frozen, clearly distressed, not knowing whether to stay or go. He apologized profusely.

"My master is old and speaking nonsense. Senior, please, do not take his words to heart!"

Li Ximing nodded.

"They were all words of sincerity. I have been taught a lesson."

Cheng Qian's expression was complicated. He cupped his hands, then hurriedly chased after his master. He caught up to him in the Great Void and sighed.

"Master, why did you have to do that!"

He saw his master's silence and knew this was not the place to talk. He held his tongue, and the two flew on until they reached their own mountain gate, a place of drifting clouds and floating immortal peaks. Only then did he speak urgently.

"Back then, Tianwu had the Wanling Upper Sect, and the Lin and Li families to conquer evil and set things right on its behalf. Their own people cursed Wanling for trying to become a second Thunder Palace. Today, we have King Wei. The purpose of the Heavenly Nurture Urn must be the same. One is willing to strike, the other willing to be struck. Master, why must you interfere?"

Xianyao's face fell. He stood with his hands behind his back, silent for a long time before lowering his head.

"Why? I certainly have my own selfish reasons. But King Wei cannot succeed! What will his end be? Can I not even offer a single word of caution?"

Cheng Qian knew his master understood everything and was just being stubborn.

"Since Master mentioned the Situ family, I must also say this, How glorious was the Situ family during the Wei era? The dignified King Shouyi, a great clan of Guanlong. And what are they reduced to now? Why must Master burden himself with these old connections? Looking after Situ Huo for all these years was one thing, but what is this you're meddling in now?"

The old man sat down heavily.

"I know I shouldn't interfere. But hearing all the rumors, I couldn't let it pass without saying something. In the end, I had to speak my mind. Li Ximing is not an unreasonable man. Forget it. Just... just consider it me, a man with little time left, building some goodwill for you."

Cheng Qian let out a long sigh and fell silent.

...

After seeing Sima Yuanli off, Li Ximing didn't linger. He summoned Li Jiangzong to listen to a detailed report on clan affairs. This scion of the main branch had managed the clan for many years and grown increasingly adept. He bowed in the courtyard and relayed the news item by item.

"...Yusui is currently in Suihuan's care. Third Brother also visited once. I heard he received orders to return to court. He came by the lake, but you were both absent..."

"There is one other matter. When you two sirs left the lake, two cultivators became ready to break through. One of them is a direct scion of our family, Li Suikuan. He is waiting in the mountains."

He presented everything clearly. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"This is excellent news! The Suiyu generation is gradually coming into its own. He is Li Suining's brother, correct? Have him come up."

Li Jiangzong respectfully withdrew. Soon, a young man ascended the mountain. He had a round face and rather thin eyebrows. He wasn't particularly handsome, but he seemed earnest and well-behaved. He prostrated himself, hands on the ground, and spoke respectfully.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

"Rise."

Li Ximing looked him up and down.

"You cultivate the Upper Rite?"

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, yes."

Though they were brothers, Li Suikuan's appearance and bearing were completely different from Li Suining's. That formation prodigy had a cold, almost melancholic air, as if he concealed countless worries. But Li Suikuan was clear and bright, his gaze firm.

Li Ximing nodded to himself.

'A single-minded one. Li Minggong has been supporting the Dongyi Prefecture for so many years. She's finally produced two pillars for the clan.'

He made a mental note of the name, rewarded him with spiritual pills, and smiled.

"You will in seclusion. What are your plans after your breakthrough? It is rare for the Dongyi Prefecture to produce both you and your brother. You should be handsomely rewarded."

Li Suikuan bowed.

"This junior does not wish for reward without merit. If I am fortunate enough to succeed, I only wish to follow the army north, to carry a saber and raise a banner for you, sir."

Li Ximing was genuinely taken aback. He looked at him again. Tapping his finger, he pushed up slightly, and an imperceptible gleam of light flashed from his fingertip.

'Utterly sincere...'

This was the first time a member of the Li clan, a scion of the direct line, had been willing to forsake the comfortable life on the lake to explicitly ask to go north. Li Ximing sighed, unsure if he felt joy or sorrow. After a moment of silence, he said:

"Very well. When you emerge from seclusion, go find Zhouda."

Li Suikuan bowed respectfully and departed, his excitement clear. Li Ximing, however, had lost the desire to ask any more questions. He stepped into the Great Void, floating away toward his grand formation.

The Purple and Gold Palace remained dark. He rode the wind inside. Li Zhouwei sat quietly on the main seat, cross-legged, his hands shielding his dantian. He held a golden, cicada-shaped pill, seemingly cultivating a divine ability.

The balance of yin and yang here was not beneficial for the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, so Li Zhouwei was cultivating with the Fading Sun Armour-Break Pill instead. He opened his golden eyes, seeing at a glance the disquiet in his visitor's heart. He smiled.

"Grand-uncle, what's wrong?"

Li Ximing sighed.

"My hands are stained by the Shehu affair. Looking back, it seems a mixed blessing at best. Sometimes I wonder if we would have been better off without the Heavenly Nurture Urn."

Li Zhouwei shook his head. He knew this elder was easily swayed by others' words. He simply smiled.

"Without the Heavenly Nurture Urn, we still wouldn't know the origin of that spirit root. There is no path for regret. Each step is taken as it comes. Resolving the Shehu matter was a major accomplishment."

"The most difficult part is over. Now, we have just cause to deal with those few beasts in the Southern Borderlands. Grand-uncle sees it as a bad thing... but I see it as a good one."

His faint smile calmed Li Ximation's heart. Daoist Master Zhaojing pondered for a long time before breathing out.

"I truly do not want to delay your cultivation. Since you are here, you can also watch over the lake. I must go and see to your weapon."

"I'll have to trouble you, Grand-uncle."

Li Zhouwei nodded, watching the man dissipate like light. His golden eyes closed once more. The radiance in the great hall instantly dimmed, leaving only the pill between his palms, pulsing faintly with a warm, red glow.
