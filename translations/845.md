# Chapter 845: A Plea for Help

“In his travels through Yue State all those years ago, Li Jiangqun once mentioned a place, a place that is normally hidden by layers of grand barrier formations. It not only severs all connection to the Great Void, but the final layer is an Immortal Dao array so potent that not even a True Monarch can see through it!”

“That area also holds a Merging Fire called the 'Immortal Dao Wall', left behind by an ancient Immortal Lord. Li Jiangqun himself said that True Monarchs shouldn't even get close to this place. In fact... they dare not!”

Chi Buzi lowered his voice. “Such a place, and yet Li Jiangqun had a way to get in. He told Ning Tiaoxiao, he told Zipei and Qiushui, and he even told… Xiao Xianyou! In the end, this place was no secret to the Supreme and Golden Feather Sect Daoist traditions...”

“Although that Immortal Dao Wall can’t connect to the Great Void, the spiritual essence and laws there are the same as in ancient times. Disciples from both the Green Pine Supreme Yang and Golden Oneness of Highest Azure traditions often visit it.”

Shaohui nodded as she listened. Though she had no impression of the names spoken, she had a rough idea of what was coming. Se frowned and asked, “Are you saying it's hidden in that...?”

Chi Buzi bowed again.

“If you, esteemed lady, have a suitable method, perhaps a spiritual artifact or a sensory array, I only need to determine the location beneath the Immortal Dao Wall. Once I’m there, I’ll remember.”

“Beyond that… I also have a Chou-Gui Hidden Form Life Divine Ability. Unlike the Purging Dew, this ability’s inheritance is not completely broken in this era. Some in the Purple Mansion Realm have it. Pristine Water deliberately didn’t pass it down, which is why it's not at Azure Pond… I heard the copy at Azure Pond was obtained from the Chunyi Dao Gate.”

“When I entered Anhuai Heaven, I couldn't find this method… If I don't obtain its origin, Pristine Water will certainly grow suspicious of me…”

He was subtly trying to get Shaohui to solve his problem. Shaohui frowned. “I knew this was going to be a hassle, but I didn't know it was this much of one.”

Fearing that Shaohui was getting intimidated, Chi Buzi reported in a low voice, “This cultivation method isn't without origin. The Feathered Serpent once had it, and after being swallowed by the Hornless Dragon, it fell into the hands of the Dragon-kin… The Dragon-kin even have the Purging Dew's Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method.”

“The Wu State's Mount Changhuai, the Great Western Plateau’s White Victory Palace, and North Star Lady of the Northern Sea have all produced Daoist Masters of the Chou-Gui Hidden Form. Both the Immortal Mansion and the Chunyi Dao Gate have the Pristine Water Daoist orthodoxies.”

“The Immortal Mansion might not be suitable, but as long as it exists in the present world… it’s perfectly reasonable for me to have obtained it. It's worth a try.”

A glimmer of intelligence sparked in Chi Buzi’s eyes as he rattled off a string of names. “I was once puzzled why all five Pristine Water traditions weren’t cut off. Only Purging Dew was, and I thought it was due to offending the Underworld...”

“It was only later, after listening to Immortal General Zhengao explain, that I understood another reason: those three Chou-Gui Hidden Form traditions are a supplement to Valley Water. It’s not just an issue for Pristine Water alone; it might concern certain people's pursuit of Valley Water, and even several Daoist orthodoxies that achieved enlightenment through it. Therefore, they couldn't just cut it off…”

“And as for the cultivators of Azure Pond, all he could do was not pass down the Chou-Gui Hidden Form cultivation method and instead spread the Clear Dusk Rain's Fruition Attainment to sever the path for lower-level cultivators.”

Shaohui sighed deeply, signaling that she understood. She lowered her voice. “You go report this to me first, then ask someone to find Immortal Official Liu. After all, it was he who pushed this matter onto Dangjiang, so it should rightfully be his to manage now… You go back and try to find a cultivation method for yourself. I don't have the ability to arrange everything for you.”

Chi Buzi bowed respectfully. “Don’t worry, esteemed lady.”

Shaohui stood up, and Chi Buzi followed, a slight worry in his heart.

‘The heavens should be able to receive me from the Merging Fire… but if they can't bypass the Immortal Lord's techniques, then this is a dead end!’

Dangjiang, who had been listening to the conversation, couldn't help but interject.

“If it doesn’t work out… why not seize the opportunity to push for the Golden Core? Isn't that better than living so subserviently under him? Besides, when he returns, won’t your chances of a breakthrough be even smaller?”

Chi Buzi gently shook his head. “A breakthrough? Where would I suddenly get a cultivation method and Golden Core formula from? And how do I know when he’ll return? If I don’t prepare, I’ll just be waiting to get my head cut off. A battle like that wouldn’t last for decades. He might already be back, just healing from his wounds in his cave dwelling.”

He lowered his eyes. “Besides… I doubt what the outside world is fighting about. Who knows what Pristine Water’s plans are?”

After walking for a while, the three of them soon arrived at Zhengao’s high platform. The Immortal General was still sitting there, but the decor on either side had slightly changed, and the bamboo scrolls that were previously in front of him were gone.

“We meet again,” Zhengao said calmly, watching the three of them bow.

“Shaohui has already told me about your matter.”

Chi Buzi’s self-rescue was not an accident. From beginning to end, Lu Jiangxian's attitude towards him was to stall for as long as possible. From his abrupt arrival at Moongaze Lake, to his pledge of allegiance on Zongquan Island, and even the final supplement to Valley Water, it was all forced by Chi Buzi’s step-by-step eagerness for the Dao.

But none of this could avoid the problem of Pristine Water.

‘Erasing my own traces from Pristine Water’s eyes is easy, but protecting Chi Buzi is much more difficult!’

Years ago, when Chi Buzi rashly came to the lake, Lu Jiangxian’s strength was far from recovered. After examining Chi Buzi’s soul, he discovered the technique Pristine Speech Heaven had left behind. To avoid awakening the secluded Pristine Water, he could not use soul-searching to change the memories, so he resorted to a less direct method, using Dangjiang, a split soul of Maha, as a failsafe to restrain him.

As Lu Jiangxian's strength grew exponentially after obtaining that Immortal Dao spell art, Chi Buzi's threat diminished. Dangjiang eventually returned to the Immortal Mansion, and Chi Buzi also gained a patron, but Lu Jiangxian always held a utilitarian attitude towards this Demon.

Now, after receiving several offerings from the Purple Mansion Realm, he truly did not want to lose such a powerful aid. So, he gave Shaohui a reply in Zhengao’s name, and Chi Buzi also gave his answer.

‘The most critical part of this matter is modifying memories… It's not impossible now. If he opens up his mind, I can bypass Pristine Water's technique. But whether Pristine Water believes it or not, or if it succeeds or not… how can Chi Buzi, under his watchful eye, continue to inexplicably gather Demon beasts for me? Not only is the risk great, but the benefit to me is almost nothing now.’

‘What’s more, Chi Buzi is deliberately holding back some information to make this seem less difficult. Pristine Water can’t possibly fail to recognize which cultivation method produced that Life Divine Ability. The Chou-Gui Hidden Form was formed by Talisman Qi inducing a celestial foundation, which means only his copy of the Chou-Gui Hidden Form's Purple Mansion Realm chapter would work. Any other copy would be a mismatch.’

The only good news was that Pristine Water hadn't bestowed the Daoist tradition. The copy of the Chou-Gui Hidden Form at Azure Pond was obtained by the Chi family from the Chunyi Dao Gate. If that copy had been given by Pristine Water, with the Purple Mansion Realm chapter in his hands, then Chi Buzi would be at a dead end.

Lu Jiangxian weighed the options in his mind, already sighing inwardly.

“How difficult it is to deceive a Golden Core cultivator! He's just talking big. If Chi Buzi can get the Chou-Gui Hidden Form's Purple Mansion Realm chapter, it might be worth saving him, at least to ensure I leave no trace myself.”

In comparison, Lu Jiangxian was much more interested in that Merging Fire!

After all, what caused his strength to leap forward was the Three-Drum Wall in the Green Pine grotto-heaven. Ultimately, this Three-Drum Wall was also a Merging Fire, which meant that the immortal spell art Lu Jiangxian had been looking for finally had a lead!

“No wonder… no wonder I was wandering all over the Eastern Sea with the Li family and never found a trace of this thing. It was hidden deep in the sea… and with several layers of barriers and even an Immortal Dao array strengthening it, I wonder if I can pass through it.”

He fell silent for a moment, listening to Shaohui report the news. He paused, showing a hint of interest. “A treasure trove that can hide from a True Monarch? Perhaps it's a trace of my heavenly origins. You should go there and see if you can contact the heavens.”

Chi Buzi immediately bowed respectfully. In terms of cultivation, only this one Immortal General in the heavens could earn his respect. That lecture on the Dao was so profound it would not be an exaggeration to say he was a celestial being!

After asking this, Zhengao said casually, “To break through your Divine Ability, you need to find the Chou-Gui Hidden Form's Purple Mansion Realm chapter from the lower realms. How could the heavens have a record of something written by some cultivator from the recent past?”

Hearing this, Chi Buzi suddenly felt a rush of relief and both surprise and joy.

‘That incredibly mysterious item… it really did use the celestial foundation to cultivate the Divine Ability through resonance!’

He, of course, knew that different cultivation methods led to slightly different Divine Abilities, but his Divine Ability had broken through without any cultivation method. He was worried that he wouldn't be able to find a corresponding one and hadn't dared to ask. Now that Zhengao had mentioned it, he felt immense relief.

‘It’s true! It’s true! As long as I can find the source of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method, it will be fine… The Chunyi Dao Gate is full of fools from top to bottom; there are so many loopholes to exploit!’

His eyes immediately sparkled. He bowed and said, “Thank you for your guidance, esteemed sir!”

Zhengao gave a slight nod of his chin, indicating that he understood. He said softly, “Since you've made this decision, you'll have to face that True Monarch sooner or later. It's better to plan early. When you get the cultivation method, report back to Shaohui.”

Upon hearing this, Chi Buzi was relieved, but Dangjiang grew tense. He asked in a low voice, “May I ask, esteemed sir… what is the cost of this Immortal Merit…?”

Lu Jiangxian was anxious for Chi Buzi to quickly settle his retreat and start gathering Demon beasts for him, so he immediately said in a gentle voice, “No need to worry. This will be recorded under Immortal Official Liu’s name… But you, Chi Buzi, you need to hurry and exchange for the Morning Cold Rain cultivation method. At the very least, you should cultivate a celestial foundation. After you’ve had your memories altered, cultivating it to the Divine Ability realm will be the best kind of protection. It’s more reassuring than a thousand words, and it will quell that True Monarch's suspicions.”

In reality, Lu Jiangxian added this extra piece of advice because he was already halfway done writing that cultivation method and could hand it over to him soon.

The Morning Cold Rain was not a rare cultivation method to begin with. The vault had at least a dozen copies. The Foundation Establishment Realm chapter was done in a blink, and the Purple Mansion Realm chapter didn't require any specific rank or secret technique, so he wrote it smoothly. It was a cinch.

Chi Buzi understood what he meant. He was more eager than anyone to cultivate this technique, and his heart was filled with anxiety. He nodded repeatedly, bowing respectfully.

“Thank you for your guidance, esteemed sir. This humble cultivator will go at once.”

He bowed respectfully and said, “As long as I can get my life back from Pristine Water’s clutches, Buzi will not disappoint you!”

The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity.

The moonlight was crystalline and clear. Lu Jiangxian stood beside the white, translucent jade throne, his gaze piercing through the many residences, falling upon the two individuals in the small pavilion.

Several rays of colored light emerged from thin air, converging in front of him, and flowing within his palm. They quickly condensed into a tiny speck of light.

“Chi Buzi is truly efficient. Yu Guang and Merciful One have already been offered up to me…”

This peacock was far more capable than the previous female one. The one who had been refined into Talisman Qi had only Buddhist cultivation methods in her mind from beginning to end. This one, at least, had some Immortal Dao foundation, and scattered spell arts. What was even more rare was that he also had a Merging Fire cultivation method.

A fifth-grade Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method, the ‘Karma Flame Binding Heart Art,’ which forges the ‘Black-Eyed Desire’ immortal foundation.

Besides this ‘Karma Flame Binding Heart Art,’ Yu Guang also had a couple of secret arts related to the Great Peacock Karma, and Lu Jiangxian learned that this Demon peacock’s ancestors once had a great Buddhist cultivators, and was even a mount for the Revered One Su Xikong!

‘No wonder they say peacocks have a great voice in the Buddhist Land. With a background like that, how could they not?’

He flicked his finger, and placed this ‘Karma Flame Binding Heart Art’ on a high shelf. The peacock's soul was then separated.

These Merciful One were indeed easy to get, but their cultivation was truly pitiful. Their understanding of the Immortal Dao and talent were equally underwhelming. Yu Guang was a bit better than the female peacock, but only slightly. If he were to be released, it would simply be one more person to talk to.

He had no choice but to store it away for later use, his mind pondering deeply as he looked at the soul.

‘At least it’s a Purple Mansion Realm soul. It's very useful for performing shamanic arts. With this soul in hand, I’ll at least have a trump card.’

‘As for Pristine Water… he might be returning soon.’

Chi Buzi was just a useful chess piece to him. Once Pristine Water returned, this chess piece would be either dead or useless. In any case, he wouldn't be able to provide Demon beasts for him anymore. His memory would be temporarily lost, but even a useless Chi Buzi was better than a dead one. When the time was right, if Chi Buzi were to achieve enlightenment on the Valley Water path, it could lead to a massive turning point.

‘I’m bound to face Pristine Water sooner or later. One more piece is better than one less.’

He calmed his mind and looked out through the mirror.

In the depths of the Great Void, in places no one could see, a vast, bright light was slowly descending. A powerful sense of resonance rose from a distance, and the world within the mirror also shimmered with a bright radiance, making Lu Jiangxian slowly raise his eyebrows.

Even with Lu Jiangxian's mastery over Metallic Essence, the sliver of Bright Yang Metallic Essence locked in the mirror began to stir. The tallest and most luxurious heavenly gate at the entrance of the entire palace shone brilliantly and trembled slightly.

Various Bright Yang spiritual energies and Bright Yang radiances intertwined in the sky, dyeing the entire firmament a golden yellow.

Lu Jiangxian raised his hand, and that sliver of Bright Yang Metallic Essence emerged from his fingertips, like a handful of conical golden light. It rapidly expanded and changed, condensing into a series of faces.

All the radiance suddenly contracted, finally transforming back into a single scene at his fingertips.

It was a dark and eerie mine. The first ray of sunlight in the sky was pouring down from the clouds, landing on the various miners, their bodies mixed with blood and sweat. A young man with a slightly pale, yet resolute, face slowly raised his head.

‘The Bright Yang Fruition Attainment… has chosen its person.’
