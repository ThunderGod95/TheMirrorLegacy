# Chapter 766: Capital immortals Dao's Choice

The moment she spoke, the entire grand hall fell silent.

'The Daoist Master Sumian from earlier was fake!'

Li Minggong was shaken, a profound chill flooding her mind. The siblings stood frozen by the side of the hall, a suffocating, bone-chilling pressure filling the air. Behind her, Li Chenghui’s earlier suspicions were instantly resolved, replaced by that same cold dread.

"That person was probing for information," he thought. "He asked about Zhouwei... his entire purpose was to ask about Zhouwei...".

How could a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator possibly see through the divine abilities of a Purple Mansion expert?. If that wasn't Sumian, who was it? Yehui? Changxiao?.

The thought flashed past like lightning, only to be replaced by a second, more terrifying one.

"If the first Sumian could be fake... how do we know this Daoist Master Tinglan is real?!".

Tinglan, meanwhile, lowered her gaze in thought. Seeing the two so shocked and suspicious they couldn't speak, the satin-robed Daoist Master tapped the table, her voice laced with doubt.

"He probably isn't Changxiao. While Changxiao's Life Divine Ability isn't primarily focused on confusing the mind, deluding you two would be trivial. To disguise himself as Sumian... logically, it must be someone whose Life Divine Ability is still incomplete.".

Her voice was gentle, giving them a moment to digest the information. Seemingly reaching her own conclusion, she asked again, "Your family head. Where is he currently in seclusion?".

For a second, the air in the hall seemed to vanish. Li Minggong froze.

While everyone in the clan knew Li Zhouwei was in seclusion, there was no specific news about *where*. But it wasn't hard to guess... the place where spiritual qi gathered, the nexus where Bright Yang converged, it had to be Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

As the Daoist Master before them repeated the question, Li Chenghui stepped forward and answered honestly, bowing, "His seclusion was a matter discussed between the Daoist Master and the Family Head. It should be somewhere on the Lake. As for the specific mountain, we do not know.".

Tinglan listened and shook her head, her expression turning serious. "Fine. I will ask you only one thing. What is the status of Zhaojing's soul lamp?".

Without hesitation, Li Chenghui bowed. "The soul lamp is fine, I ask the Daoist Master to rest assured. If something had truly happened to our Daoist Master, the rising Bright Yang would have illuminated an entire domain. The Eastern Sea shows no such phenomenon, which is proof enough.".

"I know," Tinglan nodded grimly.

"There is no phenomenon in the Eastern Sea, otherwise your family wouldn't be in this state. As long as Zhaojing is still alive, Li Zhouwei’s seclusion will not be disturbed. Things will just be... rather difficult for a while.".

She rose and paced down from the main seat. "I heard," she said softly, "that your family still holds a token to my Blessed Land, left by that old Ling Yanzi back then. My Blessed Land happens to be accepting disciples these days, and there are still spots remaining. Ling Yanzi's own lifespan is nearing its end, and he is anxious to pass on his legacy. Send a few people over.".

Having said her piece, she vanished from the hall like a gust of wind. The two bowed deeply to see her off. Long after she was gone, Li Minggong finally stood up, feeling a chill crawl up her spine. "Brother," she whispered, "Foundation Establishment cultivators cannot see through divine abilities. Never mind one transforming into another Daoist Master, even if one transformed into our own ancestor... how many of us would be able to tell?".

Li Chenghui’s expression was heavy. He picked up his spear from the side. "Whether we can see through it or not, we must act as if we can't. The best course is to say less. Daoist Master Tinglan mentioned the old story and clarified the path to the Purple Smoke Blessed Land. It probably wasn't an impersonation.".

He fell silent for a moment, avoiding any mention of Li Ximing or Li Zhouwei. He only asked, "Who among the Jiangque generation is suitable for Purple Smoke?".

Li Minggong saw the exhaustion in his eyes and knew not to press the other matters. "Purple Smoke primarily accepts female cultivators, and their requirements are strict. I think Queyi is the most suitable, but several of the children can go and try. Whoever ends up staying can join the Purple Smoke Gate.".

"Then they must go," Li Chenghui said, then hesitated. "However, given the current turmoil, our family's direct descendants should not be traveling, and we have no spare manpower for an escort. Write a letter first. Invite Senior Ling Yanzi to come here as a guest. He can take them back with him when he leaves. That will avoid complications.".

The young man put his brush down, resting it on the edge of the table. "It's just... although Queyi is an obedient and clever child, she lacks her own opinions. With the family in such trouble, once she's on someone else's territory, who knows if she'll be bullied...".

Li Minggong stepped forward, placing her brazier on the table. "We cannot predict the future," she comforted him. "If she enters Purple Smoke, she will at least have a life-saving talisman, and one's temperament is not set in stone. It used to be said that Elder Brother Chengliao was the accomplished one, I was too soft, and you were too reserved. Aren't all of us holding our own now...?".

Li Chenghui finally nodded. At the mention of his brother, Li Chengliao, a deep weariness crossed his face. "Brother Liao... if he were here, the family would be much more stable. The younger generation is not what it used to be; they lack discipline. You and I were forced to take up this burden halfway through and have no energy left to manage them.".

He finished writing the letter to Purple Smoke and handed it to Li Minggong, just as a figure rushed frantically into the hall. He was white-haired, his face a mass of wrinkles, his back hunched—it was Qu Bushi.

The old man’s clothing and provisions had improved greatly; at a glance, one might mistake him for the patriarch of some lesser clan. But his face was stricken with panic, and he had lost all composure. "My lords!" he reported, "Situ Mo has made his move! Capital immortals Dao's forces have also reached the river's edge! There are already calls for help from the northern border!".

Li Chenghui’s form instantly dissolved into lightning and shot out of the hall. Li Minggong exited with Qu Bushi, who was visibly frantic. Li Minggong tried to reassure him in a low voice, "Old senior, do not worry. Funan is heavily defended. The people coming this way are merely a diversion to tie us down. Their main army has gone to the Wasteland, greedy for plunder.".

Qu Bushi didn't know the larger picture; the news of Li Ximing's disappearance alone was enough to terrify him. Having scraped by in the Eastern Sea for a hundred years, the old man only held one truth in his heart:

'It doesn't matter who is greedy for what, east or west. It doesn't matter what you lose, as long as you have your Purple Mansion expert. If you lose your Purple Mansion expert, nothing you gain matters...'.

The two sped onward and saw rolling golden qi to the west; a battle had already erupted. Li Minggong squinted into the distance. Li Chenghui’s ocular arts were stronger than hers; he saw the distant figures first, decisively changed direction, and his heavy voice echoed back:

"Capital immortals Dao's attitude is ambiguous, and they didn't send many people. You all will be enough to resist them. I am going to reinforce Ding Weizeng. Situ Mo has been coming year after year; it's become too easy for him. If we don't beat him until it hurts and kill a few Golden Tang Gate members, that old bastard will never learn restraint...".

Li Minggong tossed the Chongming Profound Insight Screen into his hands. Li Chenghui immediately vanished in a streak of lightning. Hearing his words, Li Minggong’s pounding heart finally began to slow.

'Capital immortals Dao... why did their attitude suddenly soften...?'.

A streak of light rapidly approached from the horizon, while another figure rode the wind from the front. She was at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, with somewhat captivating features, but dressed in plain robes and holding a sword. She skimmed across the water; it was Miaoshui.

Miaoshui had once been a cultivator of Dense Cloud Cave and had some friction with Li Minggong. But when she surrendered years ago, Li Minggong had personally pleaded her case. Minggong was generous, magnanimous, and willing to bend; after a few friendly overtures, the old grudges were naturally never mentioned again.

In their last clash with Capital immortals Dao, Miaoshui had nearly perished, saved only by the intervention of the Daoist Master. Having hovered on the brink of death, Miaoshui’s temperament had changed considerably, and her cultivation had improved. Seeing Li Minggong, she wore a grave expression.

"Minggong, you're here. We just received word from the Northern Brocade River King. Guan Lingdie is leading a group of Capital immortals Dao cultivators this way. Gongsun Bofan and Song Yunbai are right behind her... there are six in total.".

With Li Chenghui and Ding Weizeng occupied with the Golden Tang Gate, their side consisted of Li Minggong, Qu Bushi, Miaoshui, and Elder White Ape. There was also Sun Bo, a guest elder originally from Profound Peak, still on the mountain. They were clearly outmatched in strength.

However, the moment Li Minggong heard that Guan Gongxiao was not present, she knew he must be leading the main force to attack the Wasteland. She let out a heavy sigh of relief. After all, besides Li Zhouwei, the Li family currently had no one who could handle the Capital immortals Dao Young Lord. If he had come personally, it would have been a catastrophe.

"Daoist Friend Miaoshui," Li Minggong said, already prepared. While crushing a jade pendant to summon reinforcements from the family, she retrieved a chain of small, cold-iron rings from her sleeve, all engraved with Pit Water patterns. There were eighteen silver rings, each no larger than a fist.

She pressed them into Miaoshui’s hands. "This is Capital immortals Dao's own artifact, the Pit-Metal Encircling Chain. Use it for now. This artifact excels at entanglement and imprisonment; you've tested it a few times before. Leave Gongsun Bofan to me...".

Although their side was short two people, Li Chenghuai was just across the river on the north bank, only a moment away. He wore the Supreme Feather Night-robe and carried the Yang family's Night Ghost Secret Talisman, which could summon Foundation Establishment-level yin-qi puppets. He could easily stall two opponents.

Since Guan Gongxiao had not come, and Guan Kan had been killed by Li Zhouwei long ago, as long as they blocked Guan Lingdie and Gongsun Bofan, defending Funan would not be difficult. They wouldn't even need Cui Jueyin for support, freeing him to reinforce Profound Peak.

Miaoshui accepted the artifact and nodded. With a light gesture, the chain of cold-iron rings began to weave through the Converging Water around her wrist. Li Minggong soared upward on her fire, activating her Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier and Pure Feather Li-Fire simultaneously, unleashing countless red and white plumes backed by soaring flames.

As expected, a woman in a colorful skirt and azure ribbons flew in from the north, tall and slender. Gongsun Bofan, still in his straw cloak, stood beside her holding his saber. The scattering of cultivators behind them were clearly not famous figures.

Li Minggong glanced at them from afar, recalling Li Chenghui's words. As the group drew near, she bowed slightly and said, "Daoist Friend Lingdie.".

Guan Lingdie, who had been extremely hostile the first time they clashed, showed little malice in her eyes today. Seeing Li Minggong bow, the woman instinctively raised her hand, almost returning the courtesy. Her hand reached her chest before she remembered she was here to pick a fight. She awkwardly retracted it. "Ming... Li Minggong...".

Guan Lingdie recovered quickly, adjusting her attitude and stating calmly, "In the battle on the river years ago, my Capital immortals Dao narrowly lost. Today, we find this opportunity, and wish to spar a round or two with our Daoist friends!".

This statement stunned not only Li Minggong, but even the guest elders on Capital immortals Dao’s side. Only Gongsun Bofan, looking thoughtful, gripped his saber tighter and watched the group calmly.

Li Minggong simply summoned her feather-fire and nodded. "Please!".

***

**Shanji Prefecture.**

At the Profound Peak Gate, the mountains were as majestic as ever, but the ground was a scene of utter ruin. Palaces, pavilions, and even the courtyards on the mountainsides were in disarray. All manner of items were scattered across the steps; the place had clearly been looted clean.

Black-robed Capital immortals Dao disciples could be seen moving about the mountain gate. Some held brushes, transcribing array formations; others held jade vases, suctioning spiritual fire and spirit water from the treasure grounds. After draining them, they didn't bother to destroy the arrays but simply walked away, heading to the summit to deliver the spiritual items.

Despite invading another's mountain gate, there was a strange sense of order to their actions. The Capital immortals Dao disciples were highly disciplined, each working silently at their tasks, only occasionally hiding a spiritual item or spirit stone in their sleeves, without any fighting or commotion.

Following the steps upward, spiritual qi billowed from the great cavern of Profound Peak's main summit. Upon the jade seat where Changxi had meditated for centuries, a youth in a deep blue Daoist robe was now seated. He had a rather sharp chin and could be considered handsome, but his expression was not pleasant.

The Daoist Master tossed a brownish-yellow token up and down in his hand. Kneeling before him was a man in black Daoist clothes, his face marked with several black lines. A white silk ribbon tied at his waist trailed on the ground as he pressed his forehead respectfully to the floor.

"Paying respects to the Daoist Master!".

Hearing this, Yehui, seated above, finally turned his gaze to Guan Gongxiao. This young lord was very talented and extremely respectful. Yehui had always found him useful, so he gave him an extra look. "You are obedient enough.".

Guan Gongxiao said reverently, "The Daoist Master is as lofty as Mount Taishi, his vision spanning ten thousand miles. This junior has only a mouse's short-sighted view and would never dare defy you.".

Yehui ignored the flattery. "This is clearly the Li family's weakest moment," he said quietly. "Do you know... why I ordered you to sit here and do nothing?".

Guan Gongxiao hesitated. "Daoist Master Zhaojing?".

Yehui gave him a heavy look. "If you couldn't even see that, you wouldn't need to be the Young Lord. Right now, whoever moves against the Li family is just a spear for Changxiao, to be used to force out Li Zhouwei. This holds zero benefit for my Capital immortals Dao. You must understand, Li Ximing is a cultivator who is deeply bound to his family. If you grievously wound *him*, he might just dust himself off, walk away, and maybe even greet you the next time he sees you. But if you were to kill Li Minggong and force Li Zhouwei to appear...".

Yehui paused briefly. "Then you, Lingdie, and everyone in Capital immortals Dao, up and down, would have to be ready to face the Profound Light from the Great Void... at any time.".

Guan Gongxiao nodded slowly. "But... our sect is already enemies with the Li family. To do nothing... to just let this pass...".

But the Daoist Master said softly, "You think our few conflicts made us mortal enemies? No. As long as you and Lingdie didn't die... and Li Zhouwei and Li Chenghui didn't die... this entire affair can be spun as me helping *him* (Zhaojing) build his reputation. It was just part of the standard process of carving up Profound Peak.".

"The only event truly worth debating was me driving him from the Eastern Sea. And even that, I can claim I was *used*... Do you understand?".

Guan Gongxiao listened, looking slightly bewildered. He watched the Daoist Master continue.

"In this world, the truth is never what happened. It is what it *can be*, and what both sides *need* it to be for their mutual benefit. Changxiao is strong, and I was coerced by him. That is enough.".

"Teaming up with someone like Changxiao, one single misstep, and you will be the one carrying the blame for him. I have already handled this affair delicately enough...".

Yehui stood up, passing the brownish-yellow jade token from his left hand to his right. He raised an eyebrow.

"Since he, Li Ximing, was willing to cede the mountain gate, and Kong Haiying is now dead at my hands, what irreconcilable hatred remains between us?. Changxiao still wants me to take the fall for him? How could such a wonderful thing happen in this world?".
