# Chapter 1201: The Hidden Ailment

Clouds drifted over a sea of unpredictable wind and rain. A Daoist Master in silver robes returned upon the wind, his face etched with contemplation. Below his feet, a silver light shimmered; his divine ability was exceedingly rare, a strange glimmer that was like gold, yet was not. This was none other than Liu Changdie.

This was Daoist Master Yuanbian. Having received news from the lake, he had just returned from the World's Navel. He journeyed all the way to the island at sea, only to find it bustling with activity. Passing through a series of palaces, he saw a youth in lavish robes awaiting him in the high hall.

This youth looked very intelligent, and his features were remarkably handsome. It was rare to see such a noble bearing; he stood tall and graceful, waiting somewhat awkwardly in the hall. The Daoist Master regarded him with great interest and said with a smile:

“And which young master might you be?”

His words held a trace of jest, yet they startled the youth, who turned in a daze. Guessing this must be one of the island's Daoist Masters, he immediately fell to his knees in a deep bow.

“This junior pays his respects to the Daoist Master!”

A hint of nervousness colored his features as he lowered his gaze.

“I am not worthy of being called young master. This junior is Ding Weili. I have come to the Eastern Sea to gain experience under orders from the lake—and… I am here to request an audience with the Fifth Highness!”

“Ding Weili…”

Liu Changdie glanced over, gauging the young man's talent and status; he was likely someone the Li family held in high regard. He smiled.

“Since you are a subordinate, it is right for you to seek out the Fifth Highness upon arriving on the island… but he has been in seclusion for many years without a trace. There is no need to wait for him.”

Of King Wei's five sons, they were either newly-ascended Daoist Masters of incredible talent or powerful Holders of the Profound who commanded the court. Only this Fifth Highness was a figure of no renown, one might even say he was virtually unknown… But Liu Changdie, being one of them and a cultivator on the island, could claim to understand the truth.

‘The Fifth Highness, Li Jiangnian…’

To the cultivators on the island, Li Jiangnian was in seclusion year-round, never stepping foot outside his residence. Many of the Guest Retainer elders had never even seen him. Only Daoist Master Yuanbian knew that the figure in that cavern-dwelling was, in fact, an illusion. The Fifth Highness had feigned seclusion, adopted a new identity, and spent his days roaming freely outside… He would only return for a few days' rest now and then, his comings and goings through the formations detected by Liu Changdie.

In truth, this was no great matter; for a direct descendant of the Immortal Clan, the dignified scion of a Purple Mansion expert, such a thing was hardly worth mentioning. Liu Changdie had seen far too much. In another clan, never mind the son of a Purple Mansion expert, even the descendant of a Foundation Establishment Guest Retainer possessed the power to murder in the streets and act with impunity. For this Fifth Highness to merely run off to another sea to amuse himself could even be considered discreet.

However, the Li clan's system was famously strict, and someone should have been keeping him in check. But out here at sea, the influence of Qingdu and the Jade Court was greatly diminished. Li Jiangnian was a dignified Foundation Establishment cultivator, and he cultivated the 'Jade True' arts, which excelled at transformation. Who could possibly control him? Liu Changdie was a cautious man and naturally would not meddle in something that seemed so trivial.

Only one matter weighed on his mind. He hesitated for a moment before asking:


“Have there been any strange phenomena over the lake recently… a storm of lead and mercury, perhaps?”

Ding Weili paused for a moment before answering:

“I have seen nothing of the sort…”

Liu Changdie knew not whether to feel relief or concern. He sighed, waved the youth away, and proceeded back into the hall. He sat in the main seat, took out several jade slips, and arranged them neatly before finally steeling his resolve.

‘If that's the case… I'm afraid I will have to use the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance.’

Liu Changdie had made a special trip to the World's Navel precisely to inquire about the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance. To his great surprise, Cang Tiaozi, who had never before refused any Lesser Yang spiritual resources or items, had actually rejected this one!

Liu Changdie was completely baffled and could not simply let the matter go. After his repeated inquiries, the cultivator of the Valley Water path finally relented.

“My path accommodates the Lesser Yang, but it prioritizes spiritual items from the modern era. Take the Li clan's Supreme Eaves Radiance, for example. King Wei obtained it from a divided spiritual plant of the Supreme Yang; it secretly aligns with the concept of being sundered into three, making it a perfect contemporary item!”

“The Lesser Yang was sundered into three parts, its power vast and immense. To this day, nine out of ten spiritual items accord with this change. Very few retain any imagery of the ancient Lesser Yang. Who knows from which ancient grotto-heaven this Trinary Yang Annual Radiance was obtained, but it carries precisely that ancient meaning… While it is certainly a good item, it is not what my path seeks.”

The Valley Water cultivator even offered a specific introduction to the item.

‘The Trinary Yang Annual Radiance is the light born when yin is exhausted and yang emerges. Firstly, it is exceedingly rare. Secondly, it is incredibly fragile. If it is disturbed, shattered, or thrown into chaos and collapses, it will spawn a malevolent Lesser Yang energy that is difficult to eradicate, comparable to the calamity of Wu Earth! However, such an act would waste a precious Lesser Yang spiritual item, so almost no one would ever do it.’

Liu Changdie's Dao-Profundity was not shallow; he understood perfectly. It was merely that the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance was far too ancient… Since Cang Tiaozi had no use for it, it had now become the most suitable foundation for the great array.

‘I still need to find a 'gold' element, supplemented by either a Dawn Qi or a Profound Qi…’

He glanced at the plans of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and found them to be quite similar to his own conjectures. Daoist Master Ning Wan's intention was to establish the great array upon the desert, using the imagery of Dawn Qi to complete it.

But Liu Changdie remained noncommittal. When Li Jiangqian had sent his men, they had brought with them maps detailing the earth veins and spiritual veins of the entire western bank, stretching even over the mountains into the great desert. Everything was recorded with perfect clarity. The spiritual energy around the Guyan area was not potent; it would likely be difficult to support a sufficiently wondrous great array.

His gaze swept back and forth across the map on the table. An idea gradually formed, tinged with regret.

‘A pity. The Western Mountains would actually make a fine ritual ground.’

Indeed, the place that commanded his utmost attention was the very same Western Mountains that Ning Wan and her companion had dismissed at the first opportunity!

‘Shallow spiritual and earth veins… does that mean a Purple Mansion grade array is impossible? Not necessarily… and that exception just so happens to be related to the Lesser Yang.’

There was just such a miraculous place in the world, with shallow spiritual veins and no visible earth veins—the Great Western Plateau! And one of the devils of the Lesser Yang, Xiyan, resided in that very place!

No sooner had the thought arisen than it dimmed.

‘Unfortunately, for one, the White Victory Dao is utterly tyrannical and famous across the lake; I fear even borrowing their imagery would invite criticism. For another… this is the imagery of the Western Lesser Yang. Since Cang Tiaozi said the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance is not of the modern Lesser Yang, it is likely unsuitable for such an array.’

Despite the difficulties, Liu Changdie's resolve was not shaken. He disliked conventional methods. Whenever he constructed an array, he always tried to come up with unique ideas. Now, hunched over his desk in deep contemplation, a path began to form.

Once his train of thought was clear, Liu Changdie pinched his fingers to perform a quick calculation and realized a year had passed in the blink of an eye. Feeling a touch of sentiment, he immediately stood and called for someone. An Siwei was soon seen hurrying in from outside the hall.

This cultivator had once been the Li family's first Foundation Establishment expert from outside the clan. Now, as he grew older, his cultivation in the Jade True arts had deepened, and he appeared increasingly amiable. Liu Changdie entrusted him with numerous arrangements and made a note of several spiritual items that might be needed at the lake, asking him to deliver them.

An Siwei nodded with great solemnity.

“Daoist Master has been away for a long time… A demon beast found its way to the island and has been waiting for quite a while…”

The matter immediately caught Liu Changdie's attention. He asked:

“From Danping Reef?”

“Yes…”

Liu Changdie sighed.

“Let him come up!”

An Siwei politely withdrew. Only a moment later, a clanking sound echoed from below the steps, and a demon beast with a human body and the face of a rat ascended. It was grotesquely ugly. Upon seeing Liu Changdie, its face streamed with tears as it prostrated.

“Greetings, Daoist Master… This little demon has disturbed you rashly… My crime deserves ten thousand deaths, but… but… the Great King…”

Liu Changdie's feelings were complicated. He asked:

“How is Fuxun?”

The demon beast immediately choked back its tears and sobbed:

“The Great King's illness is the same as ever. The Lesser Yang energy has invaded his body. Sometimes he is well, sometimes not. When he is well, he can still cultivate normally, but when he is not, he cannot even speak! The illness flared up again a few months ago, and it seems to have become extremely severe. He has eaten several of our colleagues, but shows no signs of improvement… Of the companions who came with us from the kingdom back then… there are only a few of us left!”

Liu Changdie raised an eyebrow.

“So his injuries truly have not healed!”

Fuxun had been grievously wounded by the White Victory Dao years ago. He had sought Liu Changdie's help several times, hoping to find a Lesser Yang cultivator to examine him. Liu Changdie had been powerless to help. He had inquired with the Li clan, but they were deeply hesitant to get involved, so his efforts came to nothing time and again.

Later, all news of Fuxun ceased; inquiries were met with the claim that he was almost fully recovered. He had assumed that Fuxun had been slowly healing over the years and had at least recovered significantly, never imagining he had squandered his resources until he reached such a state.

Liu Changdie was actually quite perceptive. He had received many hints from the Li family and understood he could not become too involved in Fuxun's affairs, guessing at schemes between the White Victory Dao and the Dragon-kin. But no matter what, Fuxun was a benefactor who was both his teacher and his friend. How could he simply stand by and do nothing? He finally rose to his feet and sighed.

“I… will go with you to take a look!”

The demon beast wept with joy, nodding repeatedly. It stepped onto the silver light and followed him as he vanished into the Great Void. Liu Changdie's brow was furrowed tightly as he spoke:

“Your Great King has been injured for so many years. There must have been early signs. This so-called Lesser Yang energy invading the body, did it damage his dharma body, or his divine ability?”

But the little demon beast was utterly incapable of explaining. Liu Changdie shook his head and proceeded in silence through the Great Void. He soon stepped back into the mortal world, where he saw the pitch-black seabed, and a deep, jade-like reef island appeared before his eyes.

Danping Reef lay impressively deep beneath the sea, wreathed in a palpable force of Valley Water. It was actually a treasured land of Valley Water!

Liu Changdie stepped onto the mountain-like black reef and followed a winding fissure forward. The spiritual energy grew increasingly potent. Soon, he saw undulating, deep-black palaces, their facades adorned with vast quantities of glazed tiles and precious pearls, presenting a magnificent sight.

Yet the demon palace, which should have been teeming with figures, was now utterly deserted and silent. All that could be seen were various weapons scattered upon the ground, spears and halberds lying in extreme disarray.

Liu Changdie sighed and said:

“You too are afraid!”

At these words, the demon beast dropped to its knees with a thud and wept:

“Daoist Master, you misunderstand! The demon beasts from our old kingdom were all exterminated. This lowly one received the Great King's grace and was promoted to this position. I do not fear being devoured in a single bite; I only fear that if the Great King eats me, there will be no one left to find him sustenance!”

Liu Changdie shook his head and strode inside. He saw that the door to the cave dwelling was ajar, and a multicolored light spilled out from the crack, as if countless treasures were hidden within.

The Daoist Master, however, grew vigilant. A sense of foreboding rose within him. He pushed the door open and saw an interior as vast as a great hall, glowing from every surface. In the center lay a behemoth, resembling a rat yet not a rat, a sparrow yet not a sparrow. It was curled up in the cavern, its cavernous mouth agape, emitting groans like those from the Underworld.

Liu Changdie's heart sank as if plunged into ice. He raised a hand and stroked a ferocious, giant claw that was embedded in the stone wall. He spoke in a low voice:

“Senior!”

From the pitch-black beast's body, a pair of bloodshot red pupils opened. They stared straight at him. The creature let out a long breath, and a gale roared through the cavern. The giant beast had already transformed into a human.

In his time, Fuxun had been a Demon King of his generation. If not exceptionally handsome, he had possessed a unique charisma. But now, his face was ashen as he lay on the edge of his bed like a corpse. Liu Changdie was horrified.

“Senior… how did you come to be in such a state!”

Fuxun shook his head, wisps of hazy Lesser Yang light shrouding his face.

“Some meddler must have called you over… This injury is no longer a problem!”

“No longer a problem?”

Liu Changdie's expression was grim. With just a brief glance, he could perceive the various Lesser Yang lights raging within the other's body. He found it utterly bizarre—Fuxun's injuries had not lessened in the slightest; they had reached an entirely different state!

He said:

“How is this not a problem!”

Fuxun, however, managed a smile.

“There is something you don't know. A while ago, I was making inquiries everywhere and sent my men to the seabed. I had intended to ask Lord Lu Xu for help, but he was away. On the way back, however, my men encountered another… Demon King Tuodu of the Si Sea.”

A reminiscent look appeared on his face.

“The man was quite friendly. When he heard I was suffering from a Lesser Yang injury, and being eager to curry favor with Lu Xu, he introduced a friend of his. This person's divine abilities are exceedingly high. He treated my injury and said that for ninety days, I would experience relapses. When the ninety days were over, he would return. At that time, all the Lesser Yang light would be condensed and neutralized, transformed into divine abilities and dharma power. It would be greatly nourishing and would restore all that I have lost!”

Liu Changdie had never heard this before. His expression shifted several times as he listened, and some of his worry subsided for a moment. But as he thought more on it, his suspicion grew. Fuxun groaned softly and continued:

“The ninety days since have been just as he said. Sometimes, I feel perfectly well and can even cultivate. Other times are not so good, and I can only sit here in this cavern…”

Liu Changdie was silent for a long while before speaking.

“Isn't that too risky? Was he one of the Dragon-kin?”

Fuxun chuckled.

“Lu Xu is the Dragon King's favorite. Who would dare to offend him? Besides, do not forget what I cultivate—my divine ability is already accomplished. I can distinguish good from evil, know right from wrong, and discern fortune from disaster. This is a great opportunity!”

Fuxun had roamed unhindered for so long thanks to the divine ability granted by his unique bloodline. Without it, he would have perished at the hands of the White Victory Dao long ago. The doubt in Liu Changdie's heart eased slightly. He added:

“Senior, you should have told me sooner. You could have at least let me meet him, to offer my counsel…”

The man before him smiled.

“I know the Li clan wants nothing to do with my affairs. Otherwise, with a Lesser Yang Daoist Master allied to them, why would they refuse to help me? I can understand your position! That being the case, why would I trouble you with it?”

Liu Changdie had not expected to be seen through so easily and felt a pang of embarrassment. Fuxun, however, paid it no mind.

“But the timing is perfect. You are here now and can watch over me. Today is precisely the ninetieth day!”

Liu Changdie stared into those blood-red eyes, trying to see any emotion within them besides joy. His heart, which had just begun to settle, sank bit by bit. 

Just as he was about to speak, he felt a cold wind seem to rise phantom-like up his spine.

He slowly turned his head. He realized that, at some unknown moment, someone had appeared at the entrance of the cave.

The person stood in the deep darkness, with a high-bridged nose and narrow eyes, clad in resplendent Golden Qilin robes. Their pupils were vertical, reptilian slits like those of a serpent or flood dragon, as black as ink, exuding a cold and ruthless aura as they stared directly at him.
