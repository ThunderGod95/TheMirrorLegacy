# Chapter 913, Today, It Is No More

Tangdao Mountain Range.

The array formation in the sky flickered. Dissipating flames littered the ground as waterfalls of white energy streamed across the distant horizon. A Master Monk in kasaya robes wielded a great hammer, smashing it against the grand array.

A deafening *boom!* echoed like thunder. Cultivators on both sides with weaker cultivations immediately cried out in pain, shaken by the force. In an instant, True Fire surged, dissolving the brilliant, light-like dharma power. The woman holding a bright lamp descended upon the flames, her face somewhat pale.

Li Minggong looked up, her gaze piercing the clouds. She could just make out a colossal golden body, flickering in and out of view like a dreadful, terrifying golden colossus suspended in the air. Its mere presence struck fear into the hearts of all who saw it.

These spell arts from the Merciful One were being intercepted, one by one, by another array on a distant mountain peak. The enemy had already advanced deep into their territory but seemed wary of something and did not descend personally, which granted the defenders a precious moment to breathe.

Li Minggong did not know the status of the war in the north, but the endless stream of Buddhist cultivators pouring in from the direction of Xiaoshi Mountain was certainly no good omen. She glanced around. Morale within the array was dangerously low. The disciples from the major sects were holding up, but the members of the various local families were visibly scattered. Though they said nothing, their disorganized state spoke volumes.

She had been sent here as reinforcement. Most of these people were not from her own faction; only a portion were from territories governed by Azure Pond. Still, they knew her status was significant. They cowered before her, yet she could feel their silent, simmering dissatisfaction.

'The Jiangnan cultivators... they don't really care if Jiangbei is lost. They were driven here by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and have no will to fight. Besides, the north and south have fought for so many years... their vitality was drained long ago.'

These matters were not for her to decide. Just then, two black-robed cultivators approached on the wind and spoke in low voices,

"Fellow Daoist, please prepare. If this array cannot be held, we will cover your retreat into the mountains."

As a leading figure of a Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan, the Great Xiukui Monastery naturally couldn't let Li Minggong fall into peril. They had sent men to wait for her early on.

The moment these two appeared, the attention of the already-scattered cultivators focused on them instantly. No one was a fool. If Li Minggong and her protectors left, wouldn't they be leaving the rest of them to die?

Li Minggong gave a slight shake of her head, her gaze lowered. The cultivators below seemed to freeze. Occasionally, one or two would steal a glance at her, only to lower their heads as if struck by lightning.

'Go back thirty or fifty years,' Li Minggong thought grimly, 'and my ancestors were just like them. That cold glance... I wonder which family *they* were looking at back then.'

She raised a hand, dissolving another blast of brilliant light from the sky, and said aloud,

"The pressure here isn't overwhelming. The Merciful One has reached this point but isn't attacking personally. If we can get more people... we can still hold."

While outwardly reassuring the crowd, Li Minggong secretly transmitted a message to the two men,

'How are things on the mountain? Have the masters returned?'

The two exchanged a glance and replied using the same secret technique,

'We do not know. We only heard from a fellow disciple near Lord Quan... that his expression was not good.'

Li Minggong sighed. As she did, another ray of golden light descended, striking the array and causing it to tremble. High up on the mountain, an old rogue cultivator at the Embyronic Breathing stage ran out of dharma power and tumbled from his post. Li Minggong deftly caught him, supporting him with her True Fire.

Once stable, the old man scrambled to offer his thanks from within the flames. He was clutching a broken golden dharma artifact in his left hand, and he wiped his right hand—which was missing its index finger—on his chest before calling out,
"Thank you, my lady..."

Li Minggong had been defending this post for some time, but this was the first "thank you" she had heard. She silently shook her head. The old rogue cultivator seized the chance to weep,

"After so many battles, this lowly one's disciples are all dead. If not for my lady's rescue, falling from this mountain... I could have died from the fall. But... how long will this torment last?"

At these words, everyone below pricked up their ears. Li Minggong could only reply,

"Tangdao is the gateway to Jiangnan... When it ends depends on the north."

The old man immediately burst into tears.

"My disciples often praised... said that since Azure Pond's governance was taken over, the prefectures are much better off. The tributes are low, no need to go to Yi Mountain City, and the old corruption is gone... But now, it seems the tribute was *too* light, leaving the Daoist Masters hard-pressed. Back then, we went north to plunder... In past years... even if every household had to send one person to the Southern Borderlands, it never reached the point of our Daoist tradition being nearly severed..."

A dead silence fell over the crowd. The current situation wasn't the fault of any single family. Even if the Chi family were still in charge of Azure Pond, things would be no better. But the relief the people had experienced was real. How could Li Minggong possibly explain? She merely placed a hand on the arm of one of the black-robed men, whose expression had darkened, and shook her head.

"These times cannot be compared to the past..."

She was about to say more when a figure sped towards them, stopping abruptly before her. His expression was stern as he spoke in a deep voice,

"This one is Lin Ya. Daoist Master Zhaojing summons you, Fellow Daoist. Please return to the mountain at once. Leave this place to me!"

A flash of joy appeared on Li MinggSng's face. She nodded and departed on her flames. She quickly passed several checkpoints and arrived at the main array, only to find everyone there rushing about, their faces grim and silent. Passing through a hall, she saw Li Ximing seated at the head.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

She couldn't gauge Li Ximing's condition, but she knew her own Daoist Master was not a severe or inflexible man. He was always kind to his juniors. Yet now, his face was devoid of any smile. He only asked in a heavy tone,

"What are the losses?"

Li Minggong immediately lowered her voice,

"According to the news I've received... Jiangxia is reportedly safe, but the direction of Xiaoshi Mountain was attacked. Two of the breached arrays were ours. One was held by An Xuanxin of the An family, the other by Fei Qing'yi... I heard both arrays are destroyed. I don't know if Fei Qing'yi survived or... or managed to save any disciples... Chenghao and Chengpan... were both at that location... Thankfully, their jade life-talismans are still intact..."

In truth, with a group of Merciful Ones at the Purple Mansion Realm gathered there, the talismans were purely for psychological comfort. Li Ximing's expression remained calm. He said,

"Fei Qing'yi succumbed to demonic arts and was captured by Zhouwei. No need to consider him."

The meaning behind this sentence was staggering. Li Minggong was stunned for a moment, then a look of shocked joy crossed her face.

"Minghuang... he..."

Li Ximing simply waved his hand, his expression complicated.

"Wait for me outside the hall."

Li Minggong immediately withdrew. Only then did Li Ximing's gaze turn dark and uncertain.

There was one reason, when he had first arrived here, he couldn't find a single person from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. The inner array of the Black Wave Piercing Sea Spirit Array at the Tangdao Mountain Range was sealed!

This was unthinkable!

It was a terrible, terrible sign. What kind of situation would require such a drastic measure? Li Ximing's first reaction had been to summon Li Minggong... After all, with the situation in the north unknown, anything could happen next.
'How did it come to this...'

He had only been sitting for a few moments when a crisp sound echoed from outside the hall. A man carrying a sword strode in. His face was pale, but it couldn't hide the dashing aura of a swordsman.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

This was none other than Daoist Master Zhusheng from the Shahuan Kingdom, who cultivated the 'Jade True'. He gestured for Li Ximing to enter the inner array with him. His expression was complex. He scanned Li Ximing up and down, saw that he was in no better state, and said in a low voice,

"In the battle at Luoxia, Hengzhu also acted. That Grand Preceptor of Zhao State, Wei Xuanyin, also came south... Fortunately, Daoist Friend Xiao intervened. But then Changxiao arrived... After a long fight, Wei Xuanyin is just too powerful... Kui Qi..."

He fell silent for a moment, then continued using a secret transmission,
'We retreated from the north, fighting all the way. From Luoxia to Tangdao, it took less than half a tea-time. He spat up blood three times... That blood... was entirely white. It transformed into shrews. It was... very bad.'

'Kui Qi?'

Li Ximing's heart turned to ice. Before he could ask more, they had already arrived before a great hall shrouded in black light. As they passed through the faint black barrier, they were met with a scene of rolling black smoke pouring down the steps like a waterfall. Crows circled overhead, perched on the eaves, and let out sharp, agonizing shrieks.

When Li Ximing appeared, flocks of black crows swarmed down at him, cawing and weeping tears like rain. The moment the tears approached him, they were evaporated by the Bright Yang radiance of his body, unable to touch him.

At the entrance to the dark hall, Tinglan was standing guard, her eyes filled with tears. She bowed slightly to the two of them and raised her sleeve.

In an instant, a torrent of purple qi erupted, shooting straight into the sky. It tore through the hall, shattering bricks and stone, and instantly ripped the roof from the building, leaving behind a field of debris. The crows scattered in terror.

"What is this!"

Li Ximing froze. He saw Tinglan shake her head, her voice hoarse,

"You are an imperial scion. Bright Yang in a guest or weak position entering this house is trapped by yin energy. It greatly benefits the Veiled Yin... You shouldn't have come. But now... it doesn't matter. Just destroying the roof removes the 'trapped' intent. It will make him more comfortable."

"How did it come to this!"

Li Ximing had expected the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition might suffer casualties, but he had never imagined it would be Kui Qi who died. His heart grew heavy. He watched Tinglan shake her head again, her voice laced with hatred,

"Things changed. Who could have known? That talisman shouldn't have had this effect. The enemy already saw our trump cards, adjusted their divine abilities, and modified their spell arts... To say something offensive..."

Li Ximing's heart sank, sensing what was coming, but thankfully, she stopped herself. He said nothing and followed her inside, bracing himself. Immediately, he heard the sound of faint, rasping coughs and a harsh, ragged breathing.

"Huu..."

The breathing was like a desperate gasp, yet it also sounded like a wounded crow or hawk, trying to laugh through its injury.

With the hall torn open, a fierce wind swept through, sending dark shapes swirling. The floor was entirely covered, large and small, in black feathers, rising past their ankles. He approached the main seat and saw a black-robed man collapsed on the steps. A talisman was plastered to his chest. His half-closed eyes were a pale gray as he stared at the sky, coughing incessantly.

It was Kui Qi.

Daoist Master Houfu stood nearby, his eyes tightly closed, as silent as a ghost. Li Ximing glanced at him once, not daring to look longer, and said in a low voice,

"I cultivate Bright Yang, after all. Perhaps I can help."

The man on the steps gave no reaction, lost in his coughing. Tinglan sat quietly on the steps below him and said,

"We already thought of that. Veiled Yin and Bright Yang can only suppress one another. Wei Xuanyin is a Great Daoist Master. Your help would only make it worse."

As they spoke, Kui Qi slowly turned his head. This man, usually so proud and self-possessed, now had his cheek pressed against the cold stone steps, stripped of all dignity. He rasped,

"Li Ximing..."

"Senior..."

Kui Qi was silent for a moment, then asked, gasping,

"Your family... and... and..."

He reached this point and suddenly began to struggle, his mouth gaping open, his eyes wide and staring. Li Ximing suddenly saw, from between his teeth, a scarlet, fleshy tip slowly emerging.

The thing vanished as quickly as it appeared, forcefully swallowed back down by Kui Qi. He managed a strained smile.

"Daoist friend, you held back Helian Wujiang, suffering heavy losses. We are extremely grateful. But the treasure disk is symbolic and cannot be given lightly. That bit of essence... I had Houfu retrieve it for..."

Li Ximing cut in,

"Senior, please rest and recuperate..."

Kui Qi shook his head. He didn't pursue the matter, but instead said in a heavy voice,

"Zhu Gong has many faults... and a dark past... but she did her all at Xiaoshi Mountain. If the Kong Clan is ever restored... their sect's matter... I hope Daoist friend can lend a hand."

Li Ximing knew exactly what he meant.

The Kong Clan was fallen, but Kong Tingyun was still missing, in seclusion somewhere. And she was a very close friend of the Li family—a good friend of Li Yuanjiao back in the day.

Zhu Gong's whereabouts were unknown, but after two major battles, she was certainly grievously wounded. Even if she was alive, she wouldn't have much strength left. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's reward would be substantial, and perhaps she could recover quickly. But if Kong Tingyun were to reappear one day, given her friendship with the Li Clan, it would likely cause turmoil.

In truth, Zhu Gong had a bad reputation and a spotted history. If she had taken the reward and fled back to the Eastern Sea, no one would blame her. Yet here was Kui Qi, on his deathbed, still trying to preserve that last shred of dignity for the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, trying to keep even the worst-case scenario under control...

'But even if Kong Tingyun really breaks through, she'd only be in the early Purple Mansion Realm. How could she be so foolish as to challenge Zhu Gong, who is backed by the entire Supreme Yang Daoist tradition? Why does he even need to ask this?'

Li Ximing sighed inwardly, but replied aloud,

"Kong Tingyun is not an aggressive person... Senior worries too much..."

Kui Qi opened his mouth again,

"...In the future... the Li Clan will face the north directly..."

He had only spoken this one sentence when that scarlet tip stubbornly emerged from between his lips again. The fleshy tip looked smooth and sticky, covered in faint white veins, and it was pulsing. The black-robed man struggled to swallow it back down, pounding his chest, but finally, he turned his body to the side and vomited toward the ground.

"Ommph..."

He sprayed a mouthful of blood onto the floor.

Amidst the massive spray of scarlet and black blood, a large, oval object landed on the ground. It bounced twice with a sickening elasticity before rolling to a stop at Tinglan's feet. Only then did Li Ximing see it clearly.

It was his heart.

The heart was still contracting, beating powerfully. White meridians pulsed across its surface. From a thick, severed blood vessel, a small, furry white snout poked out, then, as if startled, darted back inside.

Perhaps because of the array formation, or the talisman's influence, the blood on the ground slowly turned white but did not transform into any strange phenomenon. Kui Qi immediately snatched the heart up, his hand dripping with blood. He gripped it with four fingers, his index finger hanging limp.

The dying man stirred, but didn't ask any more questions. He just exhaled quietly,

"Tangdao... must not be held. Then... retreat."

Li Ximing had waited this long, and finally, he had received the order. He watched as the blood-soaked hand went limp, slowly relaxing its grip. The heart slipped from his fingers, fell to the ground, and rolled over. It transformed into a pregnant white shrew, clutching its large belly. It struggled, letting out tiny, squeaking cries.

"Zhi... zhi zhi..."

Kui Qi looked up at the sky. In the distance, layers of black fog were rising, one after another. The noon sky instantly turned dark. Tinglan and Li Ximing both looked up, their expressions complex as they stared at the north.

As the black fog surged into the heavens, rainbow-colored, roaming dragons danced within it. As if their mission was complete, they let out roars that were both joyful and sorrowful, before plummeting back to the earth.

"Clang... clang... clang..."

At the same time, the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword at Kui Qi's waist began to tremble madly, letting out one mournful wail after another. A fierce wind tore through the mountain. A single tear suddenly slipped from the corner of the black-robed man's eye, and he cried out in grief,

"Master!"

As the black fog rose on the horizon, an infinite black light erupted from the back of his head—a storm of black-cloud owls. A great crow cawed, a heart-shattering, soul-piercing cry. Sad and sharp, Xiukui flew everywhere as yin-spirits flickered in and out of existence.

Amidst the roiling black light, the man began to vomit blood, and then his organs, liver, spleen, lungs, stomach, all fled his body one by one. The talisman could no longer suppress his body. It leaped from his chest and transformed into a large-eyed Xiukui, its gaze bright as it stared at the sky.

The Xiukui looked at the sky for only a second before swiftly turning its head back. It let out a gurgling sound, as if in excitement, or perhaps terror. Then, with lightning speed, its beak shot out and plucked Kui Qi's eye from its socket, swallowing it whole.

In that instant, the dying man on the ground raised his head. His one remaining eye bulged, shot through with blood, filled with defiance and fury. His mouth opened, but no sound came out. Instead, the shriek-like wail erupted from the Xiukui's beak, treacherous and evil, soaring into the sky,

"Supreme Yang Radiance, today, it is no more!"

The Xiukui beat its wings and circled in the air. The sound he had made with the last shred of his life-mandate was trapped within the small inner array, echoing over and over, never to be released,

"Supreme Yang Radiance, today, it is no more! It is no more!"
