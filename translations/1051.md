# Chapter 1051: Vast Profound Suspended Void

‘World’s Radiance.’

Li Ximing secretly pondered the name while Sima Yuanli remained silent, his own thoughts churning. He knew little about this Bright Yang divine ability, but in terms of sheer insidiousness, ‘World’s Radiance’ was no less terrifying than the seven forms of the Northern Buddhists…

‘Abilities like ‘Heavy Murk’ or ‘Tainted Visage’ have to be activated; there are always traces left by a divine ability’s operation. But ‘World’s Radiance’ seizes control of the mind without a whisper, making it incredibly difficult to detect…’

When observing with a qi-perceiving ability, ‘Heavy Murk’ left a gloomy aura on its victim’s face, while ‘Tainted Visage’ created a distinct red cluster between the eyebrows, making it easy to identify. Yet, when Li Ximing had stolen the general’s mind with a single word, Sima Yuanli had only glimpsed a faint light brush across the man’s face. Once the general was under control, even staring intently revealed nothing unusual. Only upon careful calculation could he sense a hint of Bright Yang qi.

‘This is a massive problem.’

Without having tried himself, Sima Yuanli wasn’t sure he could wake the man. Lacking a Life Divine Ability, his chances of success were probably slim to none.

‘I’d need a Life Divine Ability to discern ‘World’s Radiance’ as easily as I can ‘Tainted Visage’. But I’ve heard that the influence of ‘World’s Radiance’ grows more severe with time, until the victim completely loses themselves. In the end, even if the divine ability fades, their mind can never be turned back. That makes it impossible to truly observe…’

Sima Yuanli wasn’t afraid of what Li Ximing might do, but he was deeply wary of King Wei, Li Zhouwei. That man was blessed by fate; if his divine ability reached perfection, there was no telling how bizarre it could become.

‘No matter what… he can’t possibly bewitch me, can he…?’

He lowered his gaze and sipped his tea. Li Ximing noticed his unspoken concerns and waved a dismissive sleeve.

“You are all dismissed.”

The attendants bowed and retreated. The general, Li Ju, followed them out naturally. He even held the hall door open for Li Jiangzong before standing guard outside, leaving Li Jiangzong with a strange, almost embarrassed expression.

After a moment of silence, Sima Yuanli sighed.

“I wonder… how is King Wei?”

Li Ximing’s expression turned grave.

“He was gravely injured this time and has sealed his residence. I haven’t been able to see him since…”

Sima Yuanli let out a low sigh.

Li Ximing watched him closely, finding it odd that the Daoist Master accepted his words so easily, so definitively.

‘Was he really injured that badly back then? The way Sima Yuanli looks, if I told him the King was fully recovered, he’d just think I was putting on a brave face…’

Li Ximing felt no such concern. With his own divine ability successfully cultivated, he knew Li Zhouwei was also in the Heaven of Sun and Moon’s Shared Radiance. His dark flames surged to the heavens, his celestial light was blinding, and his divine ability, ‘Sovereign’s Perilous Tread’, had long since reached perfection. He was in the process of condensing his immortal foundation. Forget being injured—Li Ximing was confident the King could stand up right now and slap a cultivator like Nuxiao into submission with a couple of strikes.

‘It seems that Profound Vastness Art, which elevates Pure Qi, is truly formidable. I must find a chance to practice it myself…’

Though his thoughts were full of this strange discrepancy, his face showed only sorrow and concern. Sima Yuanli sighed again.

“Daoist friend, you may not be aware. Last year, a Grotto-Heaven descended upon the Northern Sea. I don’t know what power it belonged to… but the ensuing battle was earth-shattering. I heard even Senior Tu Longjian made an appearance—he’s already at the middle-stage Purple Mansion Realm now!”

Li Ximing’s eyes lit up as Sima Yuanli continued.

“It was a veritable clash of titans. A sword immortal from a Supreme Yang Dao lineage had initially claimed the prize… but then an unknown Great Daoist Master appeared out of nowhere. Senior Tu Longjian, the North Ring Sect… even the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the Xiangxiong Kingdom on the Great Western Plateau suffered heavy injuries. Some even perished.”

A frown creased Li Ximing’s brow, a flicker of worry for Tu Longjian appearing in his heart. He nodded silently. Sima Yuanli observed him for a moment before changing the subject.

“I came today… to ask a favor of you. The coast is rife with danger, and I have been eagerly awaiting your emergence from seclusion. The supply of Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder can finally be replenished.”

During Li Ximing’s seclusion, Sima Yuanli had tried to find another alchemist. Using his connections, he had met with an old Daoist Master on Overlook Peak. The old man had beaten his chest in assurance, but when Sima Yuanli went to collect the pills, the cheerful old master presented him with a batch that was one pill short of what Li Ximing would have made.

Sima Yuanli had smiled politely, but whether the old man was greedier or simply less skilled, he never mentioned a second batch. He had waited impatiently for Li Ximing to emerge, not willing to delay another moment.

Li Ximing was more than willing. The ingredients for Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder were precious and its effects were excellent. Now that he no longer had to worry about his divine ability, how could he refuse? He readily agreed.

But just as he did, his words caught in his throat. He raised an eyebrow in thought as a gust of purple wind swept before the main hall, coalescing into a woman clad in an autumn-yellow robe. She stood before the entrance, a faint, pale smile on her lips.

Li Ximing jolted slightly and quickly rose to his feet, taking a step forward.

“Daoist Tinglan!” he said in a low voice.

The woman was none other than Daoist Master Tinglan, who was supposed to have been sealed within the Purple Smoke Blessed Land!

When Li Ximing had visited her in the Purple Smoke domain years ago, his first impression was of her meticulous elegance and striking beauty. She wore the same satin robe of autumn yellow today, but the delicate butterfly pattern at the corner of her eye was gone. The pale color of her lips gave her a frail, sickly appearance.

Her eyes, too, seemed much softer. As one of the few surviving Daoist Masters of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, her demeanor was lost, almost awkward.

Seeing Li Ximing approach, she hurried forward a few steps.

“Zhaojing! It has been a long time…”

Li Ximing’s trust in her surpassed even his trust in the Sima Family, and their bond was stronger. His feelings were complex as he said,

“After the battle on the river, I was deeply concerned for all of you. But with the blessed land sealed, not a whisper of news escaped… What matter has brought you here today…?”

His tone was polite and tactful. Tinglan offered a slight smile in return.

“The Emperor has established his nation, fostering martial might and radiance. The conflict between north and south is a matter that concerns millions of lives. We who follow the path of Purple Qi cultivation cannot simply stand aloof from the world. In the days to come… we will have to trouble you to look after us…”

Even though Li Ximing had suspected this was the reason, hearing her say the words herself still struck him with a sense of how much things had changed.

‘The status of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition has collapsed, and its dignity has vanished with it. Kui Qi would rather sacrifice himself for the Dao than live to see this day… And now… now she is left to struggle in this predicament, where the Supreme Yang has lost its brilliance…’

Their conversation was not hidden. Sima Yuanli, sitting nearby, turned his head away uncomfortably. He raised his cup and then set it down, resisting the urge to speak.

Tinglan’s gaze happened to fall on him. She bowed slightly and said politely,

“Greetings, Daoist Qinghu.”

Sima Yuanli had long since severed his ties with the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, and the Sima Family had parted ways with the Azure Pond. Her tone was distant and flat, utterly lacking the warmth one might expect when meeting the descendant of a former senior of the tradition.

Sima Yuanli scrambled to his feet, returning the bow with considerable awkwardness.

‘It seems… the relationship between the Sima Family and the remnants of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is not close… or rather, they don’t dare to be too close…’

Li Ximing saw it all clearly. But setting aside the plight of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, he felt a measure of relief at seeing Tinglan. After all, she was one of the few figures in the Purple Mansion Realm whom he knew well and trusted. Her skills were profound, and having her as an ally was a good thing.

He guided her to a seat and hesitantly poured her tea.

“And Daoist Wenqing…?”

If the Purple Smoke Gate was re-entering the world, she surely wouldn't be the only one to emerge.

Tinglan’s voice was soft.

“I was ordered to join the Bureau of Immortal Rites, though I remain the master of the Purple Smoke Blessed Land. Together with Ning Wan, I have been tasked with guarding the four directions. Wenqing… Wenqing’s cultivation is a bit weaker. She is currently stationed at the Violet Zenith Pavilion in the Imperial Capital, awaiting the Emperor’s command.”

This was more or less what Li Ximing had expected. He nodded to himself.

‘Tinglan, though also in the early-stage Purple Mansion Realm, is a far more capable fighter than Ning Wan. With her Spiritual Treasure, she could likely hold her own against a mid-stage cultivator…’

Li Ximing hesitated, the question circling in his mind several times before he finally asked, somewhat tentatively,

“The great battle back then… what became of the other Daoist Masters…?”

Tinglan shook her head. “Qi Lanyan attacked with his forces. He wielded the Crystalline Jade Branch. I was already exhausted, and the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion was under heavy seals… I could not abandon the Spiritual Treasure, so I was forced to fight to free it. I was struck by his treasure… and was gravely injured…”

The Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion was the core Spiritual Treasure of the Purple Smoke Gate; it was no surprise that Tinglan valued it more than her own life. Her expression grew complicated as she continued,

“Daoist Master Houfu was also besieged, but he faced more enemies and was not as lucky as I. He was shattered to pieces by a Spiritual Treasure and nearly perished on the spot… He managed to escape back to his monastery… but he’s… he’s done for.”

“What?!” Li Ximing drew a sharp breath.

“The Crystalline Jade Branch is an exceptionally potent Wu Earth Spiritual Treasure,” Tinglan said. “Once it strikes a person, both their soul and body suffer the punishment of the Crystalline Wu Earth. I survived only because I was protected by a treasure of the Purple Qi Dao, but the Wu Earth still injured my body, a wound that has not healed in years. His entire body was pulverized, leaving only a sliver of his True Spirit. I heard the disciples at his monastery took wood from a Sun-Sighting Mulberry and carved a fist-sized figure for him to inhabit…”

“Though his life was saved, no one short of those from Penglai could heal such an injury. And so long as the punishment of the Crystalline Wu Earth remains, he suffers the agony of being flayed and having his bones crushed every single day, completely helpless… I don’t know how long he can hold on…”

Li Ximing was silent for a long moment.

The cultivators of the Great Xiukui Monastery had always been fiercely proud and concerned with their reputation. Houfu was a prime example of this, a man who valued his honor above all else. For such a proud Purple Mansion Daoist Master to be reduced to living inside a wooden carving, suffering daily humiliation…

‘That must be a worse fate for him than death!’

He sighed deeply and turned to look at Sima Yuanli. The man known as Daoist Qinghu kept his eyes lowered, saying nothing, focusing only on drinking his tea.

Li Ximing was no longer the naive Purple Mansion cultivator he once was. He understood. Tinglan’s words weren’t necessarily for his ears alone… more likely, they were for the Daoist Qinghu beside him, and by extension, for the Song Imperial Court far to the south.

‘The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is utterly broken. The Great Xiukui Monastery is barely clinging to life. Daoist Master Lingu, whom they trained, is already a subject of the Song Court. The Purple Smoke Gate and Tinglan herself can serve the Song Court to the death, if only the Song Emperor will spare the Great Xiukui Monastery… and stop pressuring Houfu…’

By emphasizing Houfu’s injuries, Tinglan was emphasizing his uselessness. Li Ximing understood, and how could Sima Yuanli not?

A flicker of old camaraderie remained in his heart, and he found he couldn’t bear it. He clenched his jaw.

‘What can I possibly do? Do they not understand? It’s all a matter of a whim for the great figures in power. She thinks far too highly of me, imagining I have more freedom and influence than I do!’

The atmosphere in the hall grew heavy. Li Ximing put on a worried expression and asked Tinglan,

“Are your injuries still serious? Let me take a look…”

Years of injury had severely hampered her cultivation. Tinglan looked unwell and did not refuse his kindness. As Li Ximing’s fingers, imbued with his divine ability, touched her wrist, she murmured,

“‘World’s Radiance’… you’ve already mastered it.”

Li Ximing didn’t answer. He lowered his gaze slightly, saying thoughtfully,

“The punishment of the Crystalline Wu Earth seems to have been suppressed by medicine, but the foundation of your divine ability has been damaged… It needs to be restored.”

He considered for a moment.

“During the campaign to eliminate Changxiao, I obtained a Three-Branch Heart-Chilling Leaf. Using it with some Purple Qi would be most suitable for your recovery… allow me to formulate a prescription…”

Watching from the side, Sima Yuanli spoke, his voice pale and weak.

“Zhaojing’s skill in alchemy is beyond question… I have duties to attend to in the east, so I will not impose any longer…”

He bid farewell to them and departed from the hall. Tinglan watched his retreating back, a faint smile touching her lips. She turned to Li Ximing and shook her head.

“Sima Yuanli is of a gentle nature. My words were enough to make him too embarrassed to stay. If Yuanxiu were here, he would have remained perfectly composed, sipping tea and chatting. It truly shows the difference in their temperaments. The Upright Wood is a Daoist tradition as unyielding and proud as metal. How does he expect to master the nature of Upright Wood?”

Only then did the woman display some of her former spirit. Li Ximing chuckled and shook his head.

“What is there to master or not master? I find that people in this world often lack the destiny for metal, yet possess the heart for it. If he truly had an unyielding and proud nature, would his current situation be any better?”

Tinglan nodded and let out a long sigh. Her gaze turned teasing.

“I just returned from the Xinyu Archipelago. It seems Kuang Yu has become quite familiar with you. She said she came looking for you twice but you were gone… If she knew you were out of seclusion, she likely would have come with me.”

Li Ximing gave an awkward laugh. Tinglan’s expression then turned serious. She lowered her eyes.

“Daoist Zhaojing… the grand order of True Qi is now established. All things of True Qi in the world have been revitalized. The power of the Immeasurable Water and Fire in my hands has grown substantially. Several True Qi treasured lands within my blessed land have also transformed, and even the Purple Qi is shining with new color… They resonate with each other, triggering a flourishing of Pure Qi. The spiritual atmosphere has finally stabilized…”

Having just come out of seclusion, Li Ximing had missed the years of this atmospheric shift. It finally dawned on him. He frowned slightly, his fingers moving in a quick calculation as his Life Divine Ability activated. He nodded.

“You are right… True Qi flourishes, purple light shines in reflection. The pursuit of truth and immortality has caused the twelve Qis to prosper, and yin and yang have become more balanced…”

For Li Ximing, who had only just achieved his Life Divine Ability, to be able to deduce this much was truly impressive. Tinglan nodded in admiration.

“This is the Vast Profound Suspended Void. It dispels demons and stops evil, aiding in the enterprise of immortal ascension. Of the twelve Qis, all but Profound Qi have been enhanced. It is especially beneficial for True Qi!”

She paused, her expression solemn.

“The elevation of Pure Qi is beneficial for comprehending the Dao. Spiritual apertures throughout the world have expanded, and spiritual resources are proliferating. Most importantly… with the Vast Profound Suspended Void, the Profound Foundation gains radiance. Grotto-Heavens and Dharma Realms will flourish, and all under heaven will begin constructing immortal realms and opening their own Grotto-Heavens!”

“Back then, the Great Ning established a new system and abandoned the old names, calling it ‘The Era of Conquest, Peace and Martial Glory.’ The original name… is a secret known only through the transmissions of our Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition… in all of Jiangnan, perhaps only a handful of families are aware of it!”
