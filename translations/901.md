# Chapter 901: Spell Arts and Intent

Now that Minghui had arrived in this territory, he acted more like the host than the guest. He waved his hand dismissively and smiled. "There's no need for him. Let him attend to his affairs. We are merely borrowing his space!"

The disciple dared not say more and retreated at Minghui's gesture. Minghui then looked down, retrieving a tea set from a case beneath the jade table. He manipulated water and fire to begin brewing, smiling as he worked.

"I've really troubled you, Daoist friend. Being dragged into labor day after day by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... you haven't even had time for peaceful cultivation. It makes one long for the carefree days of roaming the world."

"This Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is truly tyrannical. Any cultivator who reaches the Purple Mansion Realm, if they have the slightest connection to them... they try to rope in every last one. Whether it was Chen Yin or Kuang Yu back in the day, after so many years, only Xiao Chuting has managed to get away completely unscathed. Even Tu Longjian... he had to carve off a piece of his own flesh to satisfy them before he could break free."

Li Ximing hadn't expected the monk's words to be so pointed, cursing the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition right from the start. It made Li Ximing study him for a moment. He waited until his cup was filled before speaking softly.

"I received their protection in the past. It is merely a mutual defense pact."

"Protection..."

Minghui smiled without replying, refraining from saying anything harsher. He mused internally:

'This person is a player in the grand game, but it's hard to tell which side he's on. Since he's part of the Bright Yang Wei-Li clan, he's definitely at odds with Luoxia. But does that automatically mean he's on good terms with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition?'

He took a sip of tea, a trace of apprehension in his heart. Just then, a Daoist Master hurried in from outside the hall, dressed in white soft armor with a light collar and a robe patterned with black and white feathers. Li Ximing turned and clasped his hands in greeting. Daoist Master Changyun returned the courtesy and took a seat in the hall.

"Zhaojing, it has been a long time."

Only then did he turn his gaze to Minghui. Seeing his attire, he couldn't help but frown.

"You've grown quite fond of this particular 'skin-bag' in recent years. Anyone who didn't know better would see you and mistake you for some genuine Daoist Master!"

Minghui, who had long ago transformed himself into a Daoist, currently looked the very picture of an ethereal immortal. He chuckled, "I learned the Wondrous Art of Divine Transformation from my master. I must practice it, after all."

As the two chatted, Li Ximing observed that Daoist Master Changyun seemed rushed. His Divine Ability was flickering, and he appeared somewhat listless. Although his dharma body showed no external injuries and his expression was composed, the instability in his Divine Ability was impossible to conceal.

'This Daoist Master Changyun is also injured... It seems he hasn't had an easy time of it lately, either.'

Of the many Daoist traditions in Jiangbei, Chengyun Gate was the northernmost. Logically, it shouldn't be under much pressure. After all, it was common knowledge that Daoist Master Changyun was on good terms with the Lotus Temple. The neighboring Xiu Yue Mountain Gate had already sealed itself off, and the Jingbo Gao family had no intention of pushing south. As long as Tangdao Mountain didn't fall, practically no one could threaten him.

Yet, his condition clearly wasn't good. Perhaps he had fallen prey to a scheme by the Buddhist cultivators during the scramble for the Wang family members. He was simply being polite in front of Li Ximing. Minghui, sitting between them, seemed unsurprised by this and simply said:

"Sigh... you should have someone look at that."

Daoist Master Changyun himself didn't seem worried. He waved his hand and sighed, "Zhaojing, you've had your own share of troubles recently. The moment the north makes a move, it's we who border Jiangbei who suffer. Chengyun Gate contains my life's work; I cannot simply relocate it. Otherwise, I would have followed Yehui's example and left already."

"I heard from Minghui," Li Ximing said, "that you still want the kasaya. You've asked me only to act as a witness."

Li Ximing was no Sumian; he possessed no healing Divine Abilities. His only way to help was to refine pills, and that required the other party to describe their injuries first. The matter wasn't pressing, so he paused briefly before raising the issue he had long been contemplating.

"This kasaya is only gathering dust in my hands. The north is vast; if I can exchange it for some spiritual resources, that would be ideal."

Minghui placed his palms together and smiled.

"But of course. My master is advanced in years and has met many figures of the Immortal Dao. He has also studied the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao extensively and is recognized as one of the foremost experts in spell arts among the Seven Phases. If you have any needs in this regard, Daoist friend, you have only to ask."

The last things Li Ximing lacked were cultivation methods and spell arts, so why would he ask about that? The issue was, while the Radiant Glaze Kasaya was good, it couldn't possibly compare to the Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions that Zhelu and the others possessed. It was unlikely he could trade it for a complete set of high-tier spiritual materials. Still, holding onto a sliver of hope, Li Ximing asked tentatively.

"If you had a Purple Mansion Realm-grade spiritual fire... that would, of course, be best."

As soon as he said this, Daoist Master Changyun shook his head slightly. Minghui, who had observed his reaction, hesitated for a moment before replying.

"Purple Mansion Realm-grade spiritual fire is exceedingly rare, and it is a treasure highly coveted by us Buddhist cultivators. They are often collected by our brethren and consecrated within the Buddhist Land, to be refined into spell arts or Treasured Artifacts. Even if a few remain in the outside world, they are all in the hands of Maha. They are not easily obtained."

Daoist Master Changyun paused, then added, "In truth, whether it's spiritual materials or spiritual fire, anything that falls into the hands of a Merciful One must be turned over to their superiors. Private ownership is impossible. Only if the spiritual resources are of lesser value can one occasionally keep some scraps."

'Tsk...'

Li Ximing nodded, preparing to change the subject. But just then, Minghui swirled the tea in his cup and said in a low voice, "It's not entirely impossible... I do know a few channels. It's just... a single Radiant Glaze Kasaya won't be enough."

Hearing this, Li Ximing immediately brightened and nodded. "That is no obstacle. I only ask that you seek out the lead, Daoist friend. If an opportunity for an exchange arises, my Moongaze Lake will certainly not be stingy."

Minghui replied, "If you had a treasure on the level of the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl, I am confident I could make the trade for you. If you had something approaching the Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions, I would even have to compensate you with additional items..."

"Good!"

Although Li Ximing felt a surge of hope, he didn't fully trust the monk. He refrained from taking out the Radiant Glaze Kasaya, settling the matter with a verbal agreement for now. This left Minghui looking somewhat regretful.

Daoist Master Changyun had been watching from the side for a long while, seemingly gathering his thoughts. Finally, he spoke, "Regarding the matter of Wang Quwan... Zhaojing, you were not present at the time. A large group was fighting over him, and fortunately, he fell into my hands and was not captured by the north. I only fear I have wronged you in this, Zhaojing."

"How could that be considered a wrong!"

Li Ximing's expression was naturally magnanimous and carefree. "Everyone assumed I would go to the Wang family," he laughed. "I feared a northern plot, so I did the opposite and went to Bai Yinzi's place instead. There is no offense to speak of. I merely congratulate you, Daoist friend, on your double fortune."

Daoist Master Changyun smiled, but the smile didn't reach his eyes. He seemed to be pondering something deeply. He merely clasped his hands and said:

"I have long known you to be broad-minded, Daoist friend. When I find the time, I will certainly pay a visit to your lake. As you have no doubt seen, I am still injured. I should have spoken to you about medicinal pills."

With the conversation having turned to this, it was no longer appropriate for Minghui to remain, even given his good relationship with Changyun. The monk performed a simple bow, gave Li Ximing a smile, and excused himself from the hall.

Daoist Master Changyun saw him out of the pavilion before returning to the table. His expression grew much more solemn. "I am injured," he said in a low voice, "but because of my Daoist tradition's particularities, I do not have many pill formulas on hand. I was hoping Daoist friend could use your discretion and refine some pills for me—something to mend damage, provide reinforcement, and heal my Divine Ability."

Li Ximing nodded slightly. This wasn't a difficult task; he could simply use the Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill as a base. It couldn't even be considered a transaction, but rather a personal favor. The man's implication was clear: his own Divine Ability was likely unsuited for alchemy, which was why he was seeking help.

He adopted a more formal tone. "It is no trouble. Mutual aid is how it should be. I have some free time in the coming days, and I can refine a batch specifically for your needs. May I ask... what is your Daoist tradition?"

Daoist Master Changyun replied in a low voice, "Geng Metal."

Li Ximing smiled and nodded. This inwardly settled Daoist Master Changyun's heart.

'Minghui provided a good pretext. While the sect will certainly provide me with pills, receiving them too often might look suspicious to certain people. Having Li Ximing here helps explain things... even if I take some high-quality medicine and recover unusually quickly, it won't raise alarms.'

...

Qinling Temple.

Qinling Temple was located very close to the border between north and south. It currently fell under no Buddhist Land's jurisdiction, calling itself only the Qinling Daoist tradition. It relied on the protection of the 'Wrath' and a minor 'Multicolored light' inheritance, having cleverly produced a Merciful One. In its heyday, it had the air of a minor Buddhist Land.

Now it had fallen into decline. The temple was small and desolate. Although its current head, the Merciful One Liaokong, had rebuilt one corner, the majority of the grounds were ruins from ages past—empty of people, filled only with the clamor of birds.

*Clack...*

A man was pacing in the courtyard. He was dressed in simple robes of black and dark grey, wore a Daoist crown, and had a small gourd and six short swords tied at his waist. He had a long face and phoenix eyes, possessing a natural grace and bearing that would make any onlooker sigh in admiration.

His movements, however, were entirely mortal. He gently righted a chipped stone table in the courtyard, pulled up a stone stool, and brushed the dust from their surfaces. Only then did he retrieve a stone flask and two small cups from his sleeve.

The flask's exterior was rustic, its spiritual light concealed. The moment he set it on the table, the faint sound of rushing water emerged from it.

The night was deep. In the distance, the mountain range lay dormant under the heavy moonlight, shrouded in dark mist. The middle-aged man waited. Soon, he heard footsteps, accompanied by the soft crunch of sand and grit on the broken stone steps.

A tall, lean sword cultivator entered from outside. His robes were black and white, his hair and beard immaculate. He, too, wore a gourd at his waist, one that looked identical to the other man's.

It was the Great Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery—Lou Xing.

Autumn was at its deepest, and leaves drifted on the wind. The sword cultivator sat at the table without a word. The middle-aged man also remained silent, quietly lifting the flask to pour the wine.

"It has been many years. Your Way of the Sword, Daoist friend, has grown even more profound."

Lou Xing did not answer. Beneath his strong, sharp brow, his eyes gleamed. "Seeing your current state, Daoist Friend Xue," he said lightly, "you have clearly repaired your life-mandate. This is not your first life, is it."

The man before him was indeed the Great Daoist Master of Mount Luoxia, Xueyang. His Divine Ability was perfected, yet he gave off the air of still water running deep, revealing nothing. Hearing Lou Xing's words, Xueyang drained his cup. His phoenix eyes narrowed slightly as he rose to his feet.

"That is correct. Over two hundred years ago, my Five Methods reached great completion. I repaired my life-mandate and focused on mastering wondrous arts. I already had a chance to contend for the Rainbow Glow Auxiliary Position..."

"But after I paid my respects to my master, he tested me. He determined my Dao foundation was ultimately too shallow, and I was not worthy of the position. He had me wash away my Divine Ability and reincarnate. It took many years to be found again. I re-cultivated the Five Methods, and, the path being familiar, I easily reached my current standing."

Lou Xing listened quietly, his eyes fixed on him. "The Upper Sect," he said flatly, "is still considerate of its own. I vaguely recall when I was the Xiukui's Choosen One, my master made some jests. He spoke eloquently, but it's a pity I was too dull to grasp it all. I only remember the last few lines."

Xueyang did not respond, merely pouring more wine into his own cup with a calm expression. Lou Xing, however, stood up. A smile touched his face as he drained his cup, and his words became even more direct.

"He said that the old books wrote: 'The treasured visage anoints the fertile earth in vain, while the Geng-origin dares to steal the golden merit.' This was already cause for endless sighs. But I see now that this is wrong. Future generations should write: 'The Dark Channel forbids the Azure Ram's crossing, and forces the Monarch to worship the martial.'"

Hearing this, Xueyang set down his cup. He took a step forward and shook his head. "That is quite unnecessary!"

The atmosphere between them grew suddenly tense. The Great Daoist Master of Mount Luoxia's brow furrowed deeply as he stared at Daoist Master Lou Xing. The sword cultivator opposite him gave not an inch, meeting his gaze directly. "Unnecessary?" Lou Xing's voice was cold.

"The people of this world, from north to south, are treated as meat on a chopping block! They flatter and fawn, prostrating themselves upon the ground. The true dragons and phoenixes have gone into hiding. All the 'Phases' obey your commands, not daring to defy! One as mighty as the Wei Emperor was left to die like livestock in a field! One as noble as the Liang King was drowned in the Jianghuai! As for Qi and Zhao, they have become mere concubines for others' sport! Is that not enough?!"

"The proud immortal scions of Tianwu, annihilated in an instant! The magnificent dignity of Zhongxia, handed over to barbarians! Hetian and Yinzhou are distant, so one mountain Sea-Pacifying Center and the Northern Sea's Azurecliff Expanse are besieged by the Five Gates..."

"Is there any place left in this world that you people *cannot* touch?!"

Lou Xing's expression was grim as he stared at the Great Daoist Master, his voice low and guttural, as if grinding the words between his teeth.

"Is it still not enough? How much more must you take before it is?!"

"You..."

Xueyang watched him, seemingly unmoved by his outburst. His hand rested on the jade cup as he spoke softly.

"Jiangnan's spine was broken with Li Jiangqun's generation. Once you, Lou Xing, are also gone, will there be a single person left in Jiangnan worthy of being called a successor of the Supreme Yang? You think Luoxia is merciless, but sometimes... it is you people who are too attached. The world changes according to the will of its people. As for the shifting of Fruition Attainment, it is the nature of the Immortal Dao to strive and prove oneself. What sense is there in assigning blame?"

"Do not speak of Li Jiangqun!"

Lou Xing flung his sleeves and turned his back on Xueyang. "Though he and I walked different paths," he said in a cold voice, "he was a true gentleman. Now, I finally understand. You left Zimu, and I wonder—was it because he truly stands apart from the mortal world, or was it merely to make yourselves appear merciful?"

Xueyang finally sighed. The six short swords at his waist vibrated slightly.

"To remain unstained by the mortal world *is* the Immortal Dao."

Daoist Master Lou Xing's black and white robes billowed without wind, and the gourd at his waist began to hum. A sword materialized from the void, his hand slowly grasping its hilt.

The blade was a pure, silver-white, reflecting no external light, as if brand new. It was two-point-nine-three *chi* long. As the sword immortal gripped the short hilt, the only color on the weapon was a single, striking vermilion dot, set precisely on the spine of the blade.

A violent wind howled, sending sand and stones flying. The autumn gale shrieked. The six short swords at Xueyang's waist vanished. In their place, six majestic columns of colored light erupted into the sky. They converged behind him, each three *chi* long, their bases aligned and their points facing outward, forming a floating screen of blades.

The Great Daoist Master of Mount Luoxia's tone finally carried a trace of complexity.

"We shared wine and laughter in years past. I never thought you would be the one to die by my hand."

The sword immortal before him seemed to hear nothing. He unfastened his gourd and placed it gently on the stone table. It landed with a crisp, clear *clink*, as pleasant as the sound of jade beads striking one another.

Before the sound had faded, the six pillars of colored light behind Xueyang rocketed into the heavens. They tore through the howling autumn wind, punching straight through the clouds and vanishing into the desolate, sunless night. They left six vibrant contrails in their wake, which slithered and danced across the sky.

They moved like six-plumed dragons in the night sky, churning the clouds into a roiling sea. A great peal of thunder boomed. In an instant, the six massive constructs had gathered their full might and began to plummet from the heavens.

Xueyang hovered in the night air, a halo of multi-colored light radiating from behind his head. His eyes shone like stars, as profound as a deity's. His lips parted, and a deep, majestic, vibrating tone echoed across the world.

"I will not underestimate you!"

Lou Xing stood on the ground and looked up. Dark clouds roiled overhead as the six colored blades converged on his position. He watched the colors grow larger in his pupils, his hand never leaving the hilt of his sword.

*Clang!*

A sheet of white light surged up from the ground and rippled outward. The flagstones, the remnants of old formations, the broken walls—all of it disintegrated instantly, dissolving into an endless grey wind. The Great Void itself resonated in response, emitting a piercing, metallic shriek.
