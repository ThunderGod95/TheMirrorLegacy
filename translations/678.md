# Chapter 678: Three Treasures

As Fu Xia spoke, the air blazed with a golden radiance. Clouds like peacock feathers danced across the sky as pools of shimmering gold erupted and a rain of colored light fell. To the north, a Pure Land materialized, veiled in mist. Through the haze, a colossal golden gate could be seen, beside which slumbered a single-horned tiger as massive as a mountain, its coat a canvas of black patterns. Ranks of golden guardians stood upon the clouds, a host so vast it seemed endless. Countless figures, thousands upon thousands, raised their heads in prayer and prostration, their faces filled with fervent hope.

For the first time, the Six-armed Vajra Guardian, Liubai, who had been relentlessly aiding the Radiant Origin Pass in suppression, hesitated. As the cry of a peacock echoed from the northern sky, its ever-wrathful, ever-tranquil head lifted. Its golden lips parted, and the melodious sound of chanting filled the air.

*Boom!*

The cultivators on the lake bowed their heads and shielded their eyes, daring not to look.

The vision was a potent stimulant to Fu Xia's spirit. He threw his head back, all thoughts of his dwindling spiritual qi and the searing Radiant Fire forgotten. The entire Radiant Origin Pass groaned and shifted with his movement, seeming on the verge of collapse.

'They can be saved… Good… Excellent…'

The old monk was overcome with ecstatic joy, tears streaming down his face. He turned a pleading gaze upon Kongheng, his voice a desperate cry.

“My lord, the Buddhist Pure Land has manifested! Please, for the sake of our Way, become the vessel for the Wrathful Pure Land! Return to the north to subdue the demons, enthrone yourself amidst a heavenly rain of mandara flowers, and for countless eons, attain the immeasurable power of the Maha!”

As if in response, a resonant bell tolled from within the golden haze to the north, sounding nine times.

*Dong… Dong…*

Kongheng gazed into the distance, the reflection of the Pure Land mirrored in his pupils.

He understood. If he just nodded, if he allowed even a flicker of the will to purify the world to arise within him, the seat of the Maha in the Pure Land would answer his call. He would become a practitioner like Murong Xia, attaining the ground of non-regression.

Once that state was achieved, he would be eternal. Unless someone could invade the Pure Land itself and extinguish the last spark of his true spirit, he could reincarnate for a hundred lifetimes with his mind and memories intact, forever enjoying the station of a *Maha*.

He would have no need to cultivate further in this life, for he would have already perfected the cultivation of a Master Monk. As an ancient cultivator, Kongheng’s next step was not to become a Merciful One, but a *Maha*. He would only need to journey north and reclaim his seat to become one of the most powerful beings in the realm, with the Dharma Master Realm itself within his grasp.

Yet, he simply watched in silence.

His own spiritual lineage ended here; all that remained was the pursuit of enlightenment. It had been ages since an ancient cultivator had become a *Maha*. If he missed this chance—a chance so rare that a Pure Land was personally extending an invitation to an outsider from a dying tradition—it would never come again.

“Venerable elder,” Kongheng said calmly, “the manifestation of Wrath is not my path.”

Fu Xia was a Merciful One. His tears turned to crystal in the Radiant Fire, only to be shattered by the Celestial Light, casting a chaotic dance of light and shadow across the old monk’s stunned face.

Kongheng looked at him serenely. The slender monk, with his naturally white teeth and red lips, was now suffused with a boundless radiance.

“My form is not the form of all living beings,” he declared. “I will not establish an infinite Pure Land. I will not create terrifying images. I will not build temples for incense, nor will I accept the worship of monks. All such things are but a source of negative karma.”

“Cultivators must not be made to believe in me. The common people must not be made to worship me. My path is one of liberation, not of gathering souls into a Pure Land.”

Fu Xia looked as if he’d been struck by lightning. The will went out of him, and he slumped, deflated. As his focus wavered, the light radiating from his Merciful One’s body dimmed. His back bent, the pressure upon him growing ever stronger.

The old monk remained motionless, staring at the sky as the scorching Radiant Fire licked at his body. He began to mutter sutras under his breath, watching as the golden radiance faded, bit by bit, until the giant tiger vanished back into the mist. All was lost.

The wrathful glare left Fu Xia’s face, replaced by an expression of desolate sorrow. “I was sharp-tongued and aggressive,” the old monk whispered. “I pressured you, berated you, and rebuked you with fierce, zealous doctrine, yet I could not stir a hint of anger in you. Had you felt even a moment of indignation, the Wrathful Pure Land would surely have descended upon you.”

“So I tried to overwhelm you with power, to intimidate you with the radiant majesty of a Merciful One. Had you felt a sliver of fear, you wouldn’t have even needed to nod or follow me. The Pure Land would have become yours.”

“Since you felt neither anger nor fear, I resorted to tears of grief. I tried to move you with sorrow, begging you to spread the doctrine to the world and sit enthroned as the teacher of all Buddhists. Had your heart swayed for even an instant, the Pure Land would have chosen you.”

Kongheng’s face remained radiant. The Radiant Fire around him gradually subsided as a crystal light flew from Fu Xia’s body. The old monk propped up the Radiant Pass with one hand. With his spiritual qi now flowing freely, his eyes filled with a crystalline light, and he stepped out of the flames.

The true power of a Merciful One was now in motion. Fu Xia could have shattered the Radiant Origin Pass without lifting a finger. The endless Radiant Fire now served only as his fuel, its flames making his body shimmer with even more vibrant colors.

“But you were unmoved,” Fu Xia said softly.

A hush fell over the lake, the onlookers staring in terror at the Merciful One. Only Kongheng’s voice was warm.

“The great *Maha*s have tried all this before.”

Kongheng smiled at him. The old monk removed his deep yellow kasaya, folded it neatly, and placed it in his palm. With his other hand, he laid a pure white staff on top of it.

After arranging the two items, he set them floating in the air before him. He pressed his palms together in a gesture of respect.

“Since this old monk came to this demonic land, I never intended to return. I have three treasures to gift you, Master Monk.”

“The first is the Mysterious Tiger-Stripe Kasaya. It was transformed from the Horned Tiger and possesses profound abilities. It can take the form of a fierce tiger under your command, capable of devouring all things and invincible against ordinary cultivators.”

“The second is the White Jade Demon-Subduing Staff. It is a treasured artifact that has vanquished countless demons. Its killing aura is so immense that the spirits of the slain would not dare to cry out for vengeance. A single strike can shatter mountains and part rivers.”

Kongheng frowned, the five-colored light on his face shifting. “These belong to the Northern Demon-Subduing lineage. I cannot accept them.”

But the old monk was stubbornly ignoring him. He held his clasped hands to his chest, his bare torso shimmering. He first kowtowed to the north, then closed his eyes and announced in a solemn voice, “The third is the Sarira of the Dharma Protector of the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple.”

These words finally broke Kongheng’s composure. He took a step forward, opening his mouth to intervene, but no matter how fast he was, he could not outpace a Merciful One.

The moment Fu Xia finished speaking, a pillar of crystalline light erupted, soaring to the heavens. Countless lotus blossoms bloomed across the lake’s surface, and a deluge of pink petals mixed with multicolored light rained down, bathing the world in a magnificent, boundless glow.

In an instant, Kongheng was engulfed. Fu Xia had been a Merciful One for many years. The moment he chose to pass on, the sound of sutras echoed through the world, the fiery prison shattered, and the ground was awash in gold and crimson.

*Ommmmm…*

But the Pure Land that should have come to receive him was gone. All the light and color converged, coalescing upon a single, crystal-colored sarira.

For all its splendor, for all its heaven-piercing brilliance, the vision lasted but a moment. Before it could fully bloom, it was drawn into the sarira like a great whale inhaling the sea, leaving not a trace behind.

The colors of the world receded, leaving only a single sarira hovering before Kongheng.

The lake grew even quieter.

The relic, about the size of a fingertip, floated in midair. It was pure white and crystalline, circled by rings of colored light that created various illusions. The lotuses on either side released waves of sweet fragrance.

Kongheng gazed at the sarira before him, then closed his hand around it and stored it away. The crimson and black light of dusk draped over him, and the light on the lake seemed unnaturally dim.

Fu Xia’s death was like that of the twelve Master Monks shot down over the great river by Li Xuanfeng. Aside from the sarira, there was only a brief shower of petals and crystal, and the blooming of a few lotuses.

And the Pure Land that had manifested for him offered no response to his death. There was no glimmer of gold, no tolling of a bell. The horizon held only the hazy crimson of a dying sun.

It wasn't until Li Ximing flew over that a sliver of celestial light fell upon Kongheng. The slender monk seemed to awaken from a dream. The five-colored radiance flowing over his face receded, and the infinite light within him dimmed.

He returned to his usual gentle and courteous demeanor, though his expression was somber. “I have caused you trouble, Ximing,” he said softly.

“How could you say such a thing!”

The Radiant Origin Pass had been a convergence of heavenly light, obscuring the view of the surrounding cultivators. Only Li Ximing, who had been watching from the side, had seen everything clearly. His expression was complicated, his heart filled with emotion. “Master Monk,” he asked quietly, “are you well?”

“I am fine,” Kongheng replied earnestly. He held the kasaya and staff in his hands. “However,” he said gently, “my karmic connection with your clan has now come to an end.”

Li Ximing had expected this. He closed his eyes and clenched his jaw. Kongheng bowed to him, his voice filled with guilt.

“I should have left when Xijun met his fate. But I felt responsible and wanted to watch over you a little longer. I never imagined I would nearly bring disaster upon your clan. The fault is mine. Now I must go. I must travel the world to validate my path.”

“Venerable Kongheng…”

Before Li Ximing could say more, Kongheng’s smile stopped the words in his throat. He lowered his voice. “Master Monk, please see my grandfather before you depart. It won’t be too late… You have been with my family for so many years… The elders hold you in the highest esteem… Zhouwei is still away… He won’t get to see you…”

Kongheng nodded gently. Li Ximing’s rambling voice was surprisingly similar to Li Xuanxuan’s, blurring the monk’s vision.

As he descended toward Mount Qingdu, he glanced back at the northern sky where Fu Xia had kowtowed before his death. The sarira in his hand grew hotter.

The brilliant golden haze had long since vanished. The soaring peacocks were gone. Everything the old monk had held more precious than his own life—the golden pools, the faithful followers—had disappeared as if carried away by the wind.

The lake was dim. The crystal light had scattered into the water, leaving only a gloomy sky and a half-dead sun sinking behind the clouds.

***

The Eastern Sea.

The night was deep. A palace of black, arcane stone stood upon a reef. It was not large, its dark walls blending seamlessly with the rock, and it faced north.

Waves crashed against the steps leading to the entrance. A pair of exquisite, azure boots stepped onto the stone. Their owner had a wild mane of crimson hair and wore golden clothes that shimmered like scales. His jade-green eyes stared into the distance.

Behind him stood a youth, impeccably dressed, at his side. The man in gold spoke in a low voice.

“Heyun, that was the domain of the Wrathful Four Demon Emperor…”

Dongfang Heyun raised an eyebrow and also looked toward the distant north, where peacocks danced and golden pools erupted as the Pure Land manifested. He bowed. “Great King, Buddhist cultivators achieve their Way through the power of the collective. The station of a *Maha* is an evolution of a Master Monk fruit. It is not something a mere immortal can fake.”

“Now that the *Maha*’s seat has sensed a call and sought to manifest a vessel in the mortal world, it means the being behind the Way of Wrath must be truly dead. No matter how many tricks he had up his sleeve, not even faking his own death could have accomplished this.”

If Li Xizhi had been present, he would have recognized the golden-robed man as Dongfang Changmu, the Dragon King of the Admirable Sea, a son of the Dragon Monarch himself, a being of incredible nobility.

The Purple Mansion demon dragon nodded in agreement.

Dongfang Heyun continued, “He was caught by the Golden Bridge Lock and killed by True Monarch Shangyuan. His chances of survival were minuscule. Whether the Wrathful Four Demon Emperor is dead is almost a secondary concern. The Six Phases wanted to test the state of the Master Monk being behind the Way of Wrath.”

“Judging by the current situation, it refused the meal placed right before its mouth and even let that ancient Buddhist Pure Land escape. It seems that Master Monk being is in a truly weakened state.”

“Not necessarily,” Dongfang Changmu said softly.

“Neither Mount Luoxia nor the Underworld reacted, and Jiangnan showed little interest. They probably already knew the Master Monk wouldn't respond. The real cause of this incident is that the ancient cultivator’s power was growing, and someone did not want him to remain in Jiangnan.”

“The followers of the Way of Wrath merely sensed an opportunity and came buzzing like flies to blood, making another futile attempt to awaken their master and summon a *Maha*.”

Dongfang Heyun bowed, his tone admiring. “The Great King’s insight is profound.”

Dongfang Changmu said quietly, “After all… times have changed. Buddhist cultivators have their own place in the world now, and many are wary of them. How could they simply allow an ancient Buddhist to cultivate in Jiangnan? What if he achieved sudden enlightenment overnight and a Pure Land enveloped all of Jiangbei? Would that not mean another war?”

Dongfang Changmu chuckled. “In the past, the Immortal Dao was complacent, allowing Buddhists to seek the path in various sects. The result was that the Dawn Qi fruit was secretly attained by Su Xikong, robbing the Dao of one of the Twelve Qis. The faces of several great immortals changed that day… A lesson learned the hard way.”

“Indeed…” Dongfang Heyun replied respectfully.

“What is the fox tribe’s response?” Dongfang Changmu asked.

Dongfang Heyun cupped his hands. “Mount Dali has sent the Plain-Hearted Fox. He has already made contact with His Highness Dingjiao. There are no issues.”

“Oh, the White Dragon lineage!” A playful smile touched Dongfang Changmu’s lips. He paced before the dark hall, a faint rumble of thunder echoing from the clouds above. The great Purple Mansion demon shook his head slightly. “As it should be. After all, Zipei gave that thing to the Dragon King of the Beihai Sea…”

Dongfang Changmu waited. A moment later, a streak of light cut through the sky, materializing into a woman with narrow eyes. She glanced around and said grimly, “Changmu, it’s time to move.”

Dongfang Changmu laughed and waved his hand. The Great Void before him split open, revealing a vast, violet expanse that stretched to the ends of existence.

The void here crackled with countless bolts of lightning that threatened to merge into a sea. Dongfang Changmu activated a divine art to shield himself from the electricity as he looked down at a pale purple Grotto-Heaven in the distance.

“Is everyone here?” he asked.

“Of course,” the dragoness replied. “We dragons do not act with the same convoluted methods as humans, with their subtle manipulations and grand strategies. Whatever those thunder cultivators were planning, we simply sent a few Purple Mansion Demon Kings to round them up.”

She added casually, “It took less than fifteen minutes. They’ve all been captured and thrown into the Grotto-Heaven.”
