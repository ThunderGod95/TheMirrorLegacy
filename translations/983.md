# Chapter 983: The Fire Rite

_Clang..._

Intense multicolored light rippled through the air. A man in golden robes, his expression darkening slightly, streaked forward. Beside him was a middle-aged man with broad shoulders, thick brows, and the deep gaze of one wearing a flame-patterned Daoist robe.

"The Tri-Aspect Heart Vessel should be beneath the Merging Fire Pagoda!"

"Indeed."

Daoist Master Tianhuo nodded, feigning contemplation, but his eyes held little greed. He watched the curtain of light descend, his heart sinking.

'The Dharma Treasure is the Lingyang Immutable Palace... so where is the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book?'

The two transformed into streaks of light and sped away. Though they spoke of the Tri-Aspect Heart Vessel, they didn't head for the four Dao pagodas. Instead, they drifted gracefully toward the palace complex beside them.

The Golden Feather Sect's contingent had reaped great rewards in this Grotto-Heaven. Their true strength far exceeded what Daoist Master Tianhuo and Tianque showed on the surface. Wanling Heaven was of great concern to the True Monarch—so much so that his father, Zhang Yige, who had presided over the Grotto-Heaven for countless years, had left his post for the first time to come here personally!

True Monarch Taiyuan was no mere Taiqing. A Grotto-Heaven was a world unto itself. The two Dao Paths of Golden Oneness and Highest Azure had always maintained an orderly transmission. The Golden Feather Sect would send talented individuals to the Grotto-Heaven, and the direct lineage from the Grotto-Heaven would in turn enter the sect to gain experience. Once they showed potential to attain the Golden Core, they would return to the Grotto-Heaven to advance their cultivation. If they perished, they perished within the Grotto-Heaven; they rarely ventured into the outside world.

Now that he had personally made a move, Daoist Master Tianhuo naturally felt at ease and moved aside, listening to Tianque's grim voice.

"The Dual-Radiance Fire Instrument is somewhere in this Grotto-Heaven, most likely hidden in these mountains by Lu Fang. Of all the items here, only this one is truly compatible with our Daoist Tradition. The rest are all items of Merging Fire. Many of them have spirit-wounding properties, forcing one to cultivate an additional Encompassing Profoundity technique for protection. It's quite inconvenient."

Tianque flicked his sleeve, pushing open the palace hall's doors. He scanned the interior and said in a low voice:

"He may have enjoyed a moment of fame, but he left no Daoist Tradition behind. This mountain isn't small, and the suppression from the Dharma Treasure is even greater. It's hard to say which palace it's in. We've only searched the perimeter, but it's nine-tenths likely to be near the Dao pagodas."

He raised his head, his gaze sweeping toward the hall's entrance as he spoke in a deep, commanding voice:

"The Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition is here. This hall now belongs to our Dao. Fellow Daoist, please seek your fortune elsewhere!"

A faint gust of wind blew past, and then all was silent. Tianque turned back.

"A Daoist Master from the Lin Clan."

These two Daoist Masters were of noble birth and possessed profound methods. In just a few moments, they had seen through the hall's layout, scraped it clean of all valuables, and moved to retrieve a bowl-shaped Spiritual Artifact enshrined on a dais.

The Spiritual Artifact was covered by a white light barrier, one that clearly required a specific legacy to unlock. Tianque immediately took out a talisman and began to silently activate it. Daoist Master Tianhuo, standing guard, whispered:

"Is that Lin Hengjiang down on the mountain?"

His pupils dilated slightly, revealing a complex, horrified expression. Hearing that name, Tianque also felt a wave of emotion and replied:

"A plush crane-feather cape, his body draped in scriptures... It must be him. The Sword Immortal Huaijiang of the Wanling Upper Sect. Only he would be capable of such a brutal act!"

"No wonder!"

Daoist Master Tianhuo's expression turned grim. He watched the formation shatter and the item fall into his companion's hands. They immediately darted out, showing no joy on their faces. Instead, he said:

"I was wondering why no one had gone down to retrieve his sword. After all, given what happened with Daoist Master Donghua, the 'Hongjiang' is probably no less terrifying than the 'Bili'..."

"Lin Hengjiang's hatred was as deep as the Yellow Springs and as vast as the Eastern Sea. And he took his own life. Before falling, he must have poured every last shred of his divine ability, dharma power, and Sword Intent into that sword. It's frightening to even imagine!"

He withdrew his gaze and looked up at the sky. An intense light was rising from the west—a pale white mixed with hazy, faint yellow specks, all interwoven. A massive eye, formed of divine ability, materialized in the clouds and cast down a thousand beams of light!

Tianque frowned.

"It's the Lord of the White Victory Dao."

Daoist Master Tianhuo nodded, his eyes reflecting the brilliant lights in the sky. A cold, furious roar, loud enough to shake the heavens, suddenly echoed from within the mountain range:

"Zhang Yige?! How dare you!"

...

'Zhang Yige? Sounds like someone from the Golden Feather Sect...'

The thunderous voice echoed from the sky, but Li Zhouwei had no time to dwell on it. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd in his hand was already glowing with maximum brilliance as he struck the barrier of Li Fire before him once again!

_BOOM!_

The intense Li Fire colors exploded outward. The radiance covering the palace's surface instantly faded, revealing a Profound Palace, crimson from top to bottom. The multicolored light streaking across the sky immediately brightened, like flies sensing blood, and eagerly changed direction to descend upon this spot.

Li Zhouwei sneered. A light had already been brewing between his brows. His Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light shot out, slamming into one of the turning streaks of multicolored light with a blinding explosion. His own figure didn't slow in the slightest as he plunged downward.

In front of the palace stood four archways, adorned with profound patterns and red lacquer, their intricate brackets and illusory colors intertwining. The surging Li Fire failed to impede him in the slightest, and in an instant, he landed before the hall.

The great hall had vermilion railings and colorful thresholds. Statues of Fire-Treading Birds stood before the doors, and both sides blazed with flames. Twelve Li Fire lamp pedestals were lined up in a row, beginning with the Long-March Pheasant Flame and ending with the Red Apricot Li Fire. The various colors mingled and flickered, creating a truly majestic and imposing sight.

The moment the golden-eyed man stepped into the hall, a colossal celestial gate, wreathed in colorful clouds and Heavenly Light, rose in the sky. It descended heavily, suppressing the central archway with a deafening crash. The Heavenly Light shone down, forcing back the opportunistic streaks of multicolored light one by one, and slamming into the cultivator who had rushed to the front!

_BOOM!_

Cultivation battles were often decided by seizing the initiative. Li Zhouwei had taken the first step, and he would maintain his lead. He decisively suppressed the man, giving no one a chance to surround him with divine ability. His Audience with the Celestial Gate immediately dispersed.

Li Zhouwei transformed into light and stepped inside. The interior was a dazzling, brilliant crimson. The dark red architecture was carved with golden profound patterns. He immediately crossed an arched bridge spanning a large pool of Li Fire, passed through the main hall, and, as expected, found a dark red immortal's throne.

A searing wave of Li Fire qi washed over him. Behind the throne was a massive screen, painted with a scene of rising Li Fire and circling birds. In the very center was a complex formation diagram depicting a toppled profound pillar.

Sounds were already coming from the surrounding side halls. Li Zhouwei pretended to scan the room with his golden eyes, but he didn't hesitate for a second. He raised a hand, unhooked the Radiant Sun King's Halberd from his waist, spun the Spiritual Artifact once in his grasp, and then gripped it tightly as he chopped down!

Simultaneously, the Profound Bracelet on his wrist vanished. Golden light flashed from thin air, fishing a streak of white light out of the churning Li Fire—directly beneath the path of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd!

_BOOM!_

An intense Heavenly Light exploded. All the Li Fire in the hall swayed, and the central pool of Li Fire emitted a dull rumble. The white light flickered, attempting to escape, but it was locked in place, unable to move, as if it might turn intangible again at any moment.

_BOOM!_

Golden patterns instantly covered his face. His Sovereign's Perilous Tread flared to its absolute limit. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd leaped, letting out an excited cry as it slammed down once more!

All the palace formations on this mountain were extensions of the surrounding grand formation. Now, a True Monarch had taken action, seizing Dharma Treasures, and even the grand formation itself was shattering and dissipating. The Grotto-Heaven's Profound Foundation was clearly compromised. As time went on, all protections and formations would inevitably vanish. Yet, even with this remnant power, the white light continued to flicker within the Li Fire, merely wavering uncertainly.

Li Zhouwei raised his halberd a third time, his eyes blazing gold, his divine ability burning. He was now using his full strength. The instant he swung the Spiritual Artifact, a world-shattering sound erupted. The great hall seemed to wail as brilliant golden light flooded the space, and the white light finally shattered into pieces!

'The formations here are decaying even faster than I thought!'

The Profound Bracelet reappeared on his wrist, as if the previous moment had been an illusion. The young man let out a slight breath of relief, quickly regulated his breathing, and stepped into the fire to see the object:

It was no bigger than his palm, perfectly round like a Golden Core, but wreathed in five rings of golden, colorful light. Countless sesame-sized spiritual fire-birds—all manner of fiery, spiritual birds—circled it. Yet, upon a closer look, it was only swirling flames, resembling nothing more than a jade ornament.

But the moment it entered his sight, Li Zhouwei raised his hand, not in haste. His Spirit Probe had already sensed it—there was still divine ability and dharma power on the Spiritual Treasure!

_Vmmm!_

Sure enough, his grasping hand closed on empty air. A surge of divine ability pulsed, hot and ethereal. The object had already vanished, having apparently activated some profound mystery to escape!

'Either the Spiritual Treasure's original owner stored their divine ability inside it, or the Spiritual Treasure itself has the wondrous ability to store and absorb dharma power!'

Li Zhouwei wasn't anxious; instead, a look of delight crossed his face.

'As long as this grand formation can be broken, this item is as good as mine!'

His gaze swept out, his golden eyes instantly locating the item within the roiling Li Fire. He stepped forward, not rushing, but instead unleashing a golden light from between his brows. It struck an empty spot, knocking a streak of black light out of the air!

The light solidified into a man dressed in robes of mixed white and purple with long, hanging sleeves. Below, he wore a crimson skirt and jade boots. A flat jade ornament was pinned horizontally in his bound hair, swaying slightly. He watched with cold eyes. Li Zhouwei's gaze swept over him, and he understood immediately.

'He came from the side hall... Two divine abilitys...'

Li Zhouwei knew what was in the side halls. The cultivation methods and spiritual items within were also protected by formations. Even if one had come straight for this palace, it was impossible to break those formations and arrive here so quickly. This man had, nine times out of ten, abandoned the treasures in the side hall to rush here!

On the other side, the Li Fire surged, and the round, Golden Core-like Spiritual Treasure reappeared. A man was already chasing it from behind, his hand outstretched. But the Spiritual Treasure suddenly pulsed, shining with blinding light!

This Purple Mansion Realm cultivator didn't understand the situation. He just thought he'd been blessed by great fortune—he entered the hall just as the Spiritual Treasure teleported to his location. Overjoyed, how could he have been on guard? Now, the divine ability within the Spiritual Treasure activated. A pillar of Li Fire, so dense it was almost physical, blazing with red and gold, erupted from it. Only then did the man belatedly try to activate his own divine ability.

_Bang!_

Li Fire exploded all over his body, blasting him backward. He was nearly thrown out of the great hall. But his divine ability flared; despite his cultivation being only at the initial Purple Mansion Realm, he had some skill. He managed to force himself upright within the Spiritual Treasure's radiance and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him sideways. His golden pupils flashed as he observed the man carefully, coming to a conclusion:

'Whole Pill... His divine ability is a bit like Wan'er's. He's probably not skilled in combat!'

His figure immediately blurred.

"Watch out!"

The man in the long-sleeved white robes and crimson skirt sent an urgent divine ability-laced telepathic warning. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in the pillar of light was scared witless. Only then did he faintly perceive a bright halberd within the crimson light, almost upon his face!

_Clang!_

A round jade shield materialized. The halberd's crescent blade struck it, sending sparks flying and shaking his divine ability. He was terrified before the fight even began, but he couldn't bear to give up the Spiritual Treasure. He could only try to stall for time. "I am Xiangli Zhuyun... My clan brother meant no offense... This Spiritual Treasure is crucial. We are willing to compensate you with other items..."

The only answer he received was his own jade shield being forced back step by step. Intense Bright Yang radiance scattered in all directions. A cold laugh was faintly heard.

"So, you are together."

Before the words had even faded, the halberd's bright, illusory form leaped up from behind the shield. The crescent blade flipped, clamping down on the round shield. The man's heart seized. He squeezed his eyes shut and spat out a mouthful of Cinnabar!

The Cinnabar scattered, instantly pushing back the golden light and allowing him to escape the immediate danger. Fury rose in his eyes. Seeing his opponent charge straight at him, he frantically activated his divine ability and shouted:

"I'll hold him off! Get the item!"

Just then, the round, Golden Core-like Spiritual Treasure in the air seemed to be stimulated. It glowed brightly again, scattering down layers of a wondrous, illusionary mist of Li Fire. In an instant, it shrouded the entire hall. A powerful, baleful fire washed over him, and his heart leaped with joy.

'Heaven is helping me!'

His judgment wasn't poor. He could see that the Spiritual Treasure still held a divine ability and possessed the power of teleportation. But a Spiritual Treasure was not a cultivator. Once it began to cast a large-scale spell art, it couldn't simultaneously use its teleportation mystery. It would be unable to evade a cultivator's grasp!

And the Li Fire mist it released would also obstruct Li Zhouwei!

'Fortune truly is on my side!'

But his thought had barely settled. He had just relaxed his divine ability when the red mist in front of him was torn open, revealing a gleaming halberd blade!

It was right in front of him. Unavoidable.

"Ah?!"

_BOOM!_

A violent explosion echoed through the Li Fire mist. Spiritual sense was already blocked in this place. The other man—the one in the long-sleeved white robes and crimson skirt—couldn't even see his surroundings, but he knew this was the perfect opportunity!

He ignored the sound, bit his finger, and pressed the blood to his brow. His vision instantly cleared, allowing him to spot the round Spiritual Treasure. He immediately leaped into the air, straining.

But a large hand had already pierced through the Li Fire mist. Seizing the moment the Spiritual Treasure was releasing its mystery and couldn't escape, the hand grabbed it fiercely!

_Thud!_

The suppressive power of Audience with the Celestial Gate and the divine might of Sovereign's Perilous Tread operated in unison, finally locking the Li Fire Spiritual Treasure in place. The item was not without a master, after all, and still refused to submit. It began to struggle wildly.

The undissipated divine ability pulsed on the Spiritual Treasure's surface, seeping through his fingers like flames of Li Fire. It trembled violently, but its chance to escape was gone!

Scalding dharma power blasted his palm, burning his fingers white, but Li Zhouwei's expression didn't change one bit from the pain. His heart was finally overcome with joy:

'A Li Fire Spiritual Treasure! It's mine!'

"You!"

As Li Zhouwei's hand tightened, the Li Fire mist in the hall instantly dissipated. The man's pupils shrank in shock. He saw his clan brother clutching a hole in his chest, vomiting blood. Pulses of golden light were erupting from the wound. The injured man gritted his teeth, blood in his mouth, and choked out:

"Go!"

Now that the item was in Li Zhouwei's hands, the two of them could never get it back. Whether they could win a fight or not, there was no point in fighting. They wisely abandoned the hall and fled elsewhere.

Li Zhouwei didn't spare a single glance for the two Northern Barbarians. His golden eyes turned, his gaze landing like a beam of light on the side hall.

Li Fire roiled within that hall. Even for such a grand immortal palace, without the protection of its formations, it couldn't withstand the high-intensity battle between Purple Mansion Realm experts. Churning Li Fire poured out from the golden patterns, flowing across the floor.

In the middle of a thick set of shelves stood a jade dais. On it rested a splendid, deep-red jade slip, flanked by two jade boxes, all of which radiated a powerful Li Fire glow.

And in that hall, two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were locked in a fierce battle. Converging Water and Heavenly Light intertwined. One, dressed in flowing blue robes, appeared younger. The other was older, wearing yellow robes and a jade pendant at his waist. They were fighting inextricably.

When the two saw him, they clearly recognized him on sight. Both their expressions changed at once!

A trace of surprise finally flickered in Li Zhouwei's eyes.

This yellow-robed Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was also practicing the Bright Yang! Even the divine ability fluctuations coming from him felt familiar... they shared several similarities with the aura of his own Sovereign's Perilous Tread.

'This seems to be the Cui Clan's methodology... It's likely a lineage from Chongzhou Island!'

There were only a few factions in the world that cultivated the Bright Yang. The identity of the man before him was obvious. Li Zhouwei stared at him, the golden patterns on his face growing brighter. He pointed his halberd, stepped through the roiling Li Fire, and smiled, his meaning unclear.

'So, it's Daoist Master Yangya!'
