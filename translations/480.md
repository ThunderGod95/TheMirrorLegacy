# Chapter 707: Wrapping Things Up

The Han Family’s Dongliu Island was renowned for its rich deposits of spirit sulfur and spirit brimstone. Their earliest ancestor had been just a rogue cultivator selling spirit sulfur, but through generations of accumulation and currying favor with various powers, they had slowly risen to their current status.

Li Qinghong rode the wind and arrived at Dongliu Island which appeared peaceful and calm. She pondered quietly for a moment, I don’t know what kind of attitude the Han Family has… better not reveal myself just yet.

She cast an invisibility art and descended using her mana, arriving in the bustling market district. The population was decent and cultivators moved to and fro in a steady stream. She located one of the Han Family’s own establishments.

As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, she passed directly through the compound and reached the great hall at the back. There, a steward was busy with an abacus. He was at the Qi Cultivation Realm and appeared dressed like a trusted retainer of the Han Family.

A violet light rippled over her body as she slowly became visible from head to toe, and she asked, “Have your master come out and meet me.”

She suddenly appeared in the courtyard, thunder flashed in her eyes as her aura surged forth. The man was startled at first, then took in her clean jade armor and the mysterious violet flask at her waist. It was clear that she was no ordinary figure.

“Greetings, Fairy! Greetings, Fairy! The patriarch has gone out. I will summon an elder right away!”

He bowed repeatedly, then hurried off. Not long after, he returned with a middle-aged man in a red robe who was looking anxious. The man who was at the early stage of Foundation Establishment Realm stepped forward and spoke softly, “I am Han Shihai. This is not a suitable place to talk. May I invite the Fairy to follow me inside?”

Li Qinghong nodded. Once they were inside the courtyard and tea had been served, Han Shihai tried to maintain his composure, but he kept turning the jade teacup in his hand as he asked softly, “Fairy… might you be from Azure Pond… or from Moongaze Lake?”

Li Qinghong had been training in the Eastern Sea for many years, often traveling to gather lightning. Occasionally she would stay temporarily and pay visits to nearby factions, so she knew the Han Family fairly well.

She knew well that Han Shizhen and his attendant had already perished. The Han Family had lost two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in one blow. One was a late-stage family head and another was a mid-stage loyal servant. With both arms severed, their wounds were severe enough to shake the very foundation of the family.

The death of Han Shizhen was surely known within the Han Family, but they had managed things well. On the surface, all seemed calm, yet behind the scenes, they were likely gripped by fear and unease.

Li Qinghong sighed inwardly and spoke softly, “I am Li Qinghong of the Li Family. I’ve come regarding a matter concerning my nephew.”

She paused briefly, her expression growing solemn as she asked, “My nephew Xizhi has gone missing. I went to Green Pine Island and heard only that he came to your esteemed family. Might I ask…”

The middle-aged man’s face instantly turned pale as he murmured, “Li Xizhi has gone missing… So it’s true!”

Li Xizhi was not only a disciple of Azure Pond, but also a direct descendant of the Li Family. Han Shihai had yet to recover from the grief of his elder brother’s death, and now felt even more terrified. He asked quickly, “How could this be? Could he have run into some demonic creature?”

He knew full well that this was no trivial matter, the Li Family had connections to the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator within the Azure Pond Sect. If Li Xizhi had truly perished, Azure Pond would never let this slide. His face grew even paler, and then he thought of someone, Li Xuanfeng, the Golden Bowstring!

This man’s reputation had been growing in recent years. The Han Family had personally witnessed him slay a mid-Foundation Establishment demonic beast. After just a few arrows near Dongliu Island, the creature had plunged straight into the sea!

If something happened to Li Xizhi, that ruthless man won’t let it go easily! I’ve heard he’s unreasonable. He might just storm the island!

Han Shihai’s face grew even paler. Their family’s ancestor had gone into seclusion decades ago to attempt a breakthrough into Purple Mansion Realm. By now, after so long without news, they were most likely dead. And now, with two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators dead, they had drawn the suspicion of the Li Family and Azure Pond Sect…

Seeing the whitened lips and panicked expression on his face, Li Qinghong could tell he’d already connected many dots. The words she had prepared were now tempered, and she thought to herself, The Han Family has long held friendly ties with ours. Han Shizhen may have come for profit, but in the end, he perished while handling Xizhi’s matter… In a way, it’s our Li Family that owes them. I shouldn’t press him too hard.

Her expression turned solemn. She didn’t take a single sip of her tea, setting the jade cup lightly on the table as she asked, “Is Han Shizhen dead?”

Han Shihai trembled. He had no idea how she knew, but could only respond sorrowfully, “Yes… But… but I truly don’t know where my elder brother took your esteemed one! I heard it was in search of Yuan Tuan…”

As a cultivator of the Eastern Sea, he had long grown used to death and injury. He wasn’t even thinking about avenging his brother as he only wanted to get through this situation as quickly as possible. He said in a low voice, “Fairy, do you have any news about them? Truly, this has nothing to do with our family!”

Li Qinghong paused, then said softly, “I do know a few things… It was in pursuit of Yuan Tuan. Since this was a private matter, I won’t press too hard. Finding them is the priority. Do you have any idea where they might have gone? I’ll go search.”

Han Shihai looked as if he’d been granted amnesty and quickly replied, “I heard they headed toward the Qunyi Sea!”

“Very well, I’ll go search there.” Li Qinghong nodded, seemingly ready to ride the lightning and depart. But then, as if suddenly remembering something, she spoke offhandedly, “Azure Pond Sect will likely send someone to investigate and they won’t be as lenient as I am. Fellow Daoist, you’d best pray for good fortune.”

Han Shihai had just begun to breathe easy when tension returned with a vengeance. Li Qinghong had struck right at his sore spot. He quickly said, “Fairy, please wait!”

Seeing Li Qinghong turn back, he immediately put on a sorrowful face. His expression shifted swiftly as he pleaded in a low, grief-stricken voice, “Our family has so few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Yet my elder brother took someone into the Eastern Sea and lost his life for nothing. Azure Pond Sect is fierce, just as you say, they won’t show mercy… Please, Fairy… show us a way forward.”

He gritted his teeth and said softly, “I don’t know the full details of the entanglement between my brother and your Daoist, but if your esteemed family has any requests, our Han Family is willing to cooperate fully. We'll help your family search for the Daoist’s whereabouts!”

Han Shihai was doing his best to curry favor, but Li Qinghong wasn’t the type to kick someone when they were down. All she cared about was the Han Family keeping this quiet, she had no mind to take advantage. She simply replied, “Fellow Daoist, our two families have a history of friendship and many years of trade. To be fair and honest, most of the blame for this doesn’t lie with your esteemed family.”

She gave a small nod and continued saying, “If Azure Pond Sect sends someone, your family need only insist that Xizhi came asking for news, then parted ways with your people. My family has connections within the sect, we won’t let your family fall afoul of Azure Pond.”

Han Shihai was stunned for a moment, then realization slowly dawned in his heart, That’s right… Inland families like the Li Family are said to value virtue and morality. No wonder she’s letting us off so easily… Good, good. People like her care about honor and reputation, I should flatter her a bit more.

With that thought, he immediately put on a grateful expression, his eyes almost brimming with tears, his face once again assuming sorrow as he spoke in a hushed tone, “Fairy! Thank you, Fairy! Such great kindness and virtue, our household has no way to repay it. Your sense of right and wrong truly makes you a model among the inland families…”

Han Shihai went on with scattered and overly careful praise, wracking his brain to say the right things. But Li Qinghong, having spent so many years overseas, knew exactly what these outer-sea families were like. She simply nodded perfunctorily and instructed, “There’s one thing for you to take note of, I came here quietly. Aside from that steward, no one else saw me on the island. This conversation must be kept secret, no third party must know. Just act as if I was never here.”

Han Shihai immediately understood, a ruthless glint flashing across his face. He revealed the true nature of an outer-sea cultivator as he respectfully said, “Rest assured, Fairy. No third person will ever know.”

Li Qinghong saw it clearly, the steward’s fate was likely sealed. But it was another family’s affair and concerned the Han Family’s very survival. She cupped her hands slightly, a hint of urgency appeared on her face as she said, “I must hurry to find my nephew. I truly can’t linger here any longer!”

This excuse only made Han Shihai believe her more. He nodded repeatedly, but still felt uneasy. Then he noticed that Li Qinghong hadn’t yet left, she was watching him with a pleasant smile. At that moment, Han Shihai understood and thought, She’s still expecting something!

He thought for just a moment. The Demon Subduing Copper Rods from the Yuan Family had always felt too hot to hold. He quickly took them from his storage pouch and lied, “This item is a dharma artifact once belonging to Yuan Chengdun. It fell into the hands of a rogue cultivator, and we later acquired it. We hadn’t yet had the chance to present it to the Daoist, so we’ll entrust it to you, Fairy.”

Li Qinghong glanced at the rods and saw their brilliant glow. The twin rods had blue-gold hue with intricate patterns. A rare matched pair of Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts. She replied, “This was a relic of Elder Yuan. He had ties with our family. I’ll see to it this is returned to his eldest son. I won’t claim it for myself.”

Han Shihai stared at her blankly, watching her take her leave and vanish outside the formation. He stood there for several breaths before murmuring, “Virtue… truly the most extravagant of all things.”

He was faintly moved, his hand resting on his sword as he walked to the threshold. The steward was lurking nearby, peeking out nervously. Upon seeing him, the man quickly withdrew his head, bowing quietly, waiting at his side.

If not for his brother’s death, Han Shihai might have rewarded the man in a moment of ease. But now, he smiled pleasantly and said, “Come.”

The steward took a step forward. Then, Han Shihai drew his sword and brought it down in one swift stroke, beheading him. The blood hadn’t even begun to spurt before it was drawn into the small gourd at Han’s waist. Flesh was stripped and bones crushed. In a matter of a few seconds, the man had vanished completely.

Han Shihai shook the jade gourd, listening to the sounds inside as he silently calculated, I’ll still need a proper excuse… to conceal my brother’s death, so the nearby families don’t start getting ideas.

Milin Peak.

The items from the secret chamber of Milin Peak had all been brought out, filling the hall completely. Li Ximing, distracted, was fiddling with the Six Xin Harmonising Metal Token in his hand.

The token had a smooth, silver-gray surface. When exposed to sunlight, it would regain its silvery-white and purplish hue. But whatever had once been inside it had long been taken out. Only the notably sturdy shell remained.

Li Xijun was counting the treasures. He glanced briefly at Li Ximing and said gently, “Keep that Six Xin Harmonising Metal Token for now. When there’s a chance, send it to the southern border. Great uncle practices the Metal Dao, it would be better in his hands.”

“Understood.” Li Ximing replied, then muttered, “Merging Fire, Converging Water, Harmonising Metal… If the pattern holds, there should be five tokens. I wonder what they’re for. Converging Water… maybe it’s in the hands of the Dragon family.”

Li Xijun chuckled and simply said, “I’ve never heard of this Harmonising Metal. Perhaps it belongs to some Dao lineage in the north…”

He mentioned it in passing, then turned his attention back to the items before him. The Yu Family had suffered repeated setbacks in recent years and their foundation had been nearly exhausted. The only things truly worth taking were a few treasured panaceas.

Li Xijun was less knowledgeable in this area than Li Ximing, so he waited for him to take the jade box and lift the lid. Inside was a purple fruit that was the size of a fist. It was covered in countless tiny holes, with wisps of smoke drifting lazily from it.

Li Ximing examined it closely and replied, “Purple Lian Bodhi.”

He studied it carefully as it was his first time seeing such a thing. He spoke softly, “This is not something of the Immortal family.”

“Hmm?”

Li Xijun frowned, while Li Ximing, who had received instruction from Xiao Yuansi and was quite well-informed, explained softly, “It’s said that the Revered One wandered the nations, and wherever he paused in the face of mortal suffering, a strange fruit would appear. That fruit was the Purple Lian Bodhi. It is highly prized by Buddhist cultivators.”

“Indeed.” Li Xijun nodded and said in a low voice, “Kongheng has served our family in the Eastern Sea for decades. He was diligent, loyal and never asked for anything. We’ve never rewarded him properly… Let’s gift him this.”

Li Ximing naturally had no objection. He picked up two more jade boxes to examine. One of the remaining treasured panaceas was small and light. It was barely the size of an eyeball, pure white and crystal clear, as though it might float away at any moment. It was the healing Gorgecloud Vine.

The other emitted flickering flames that were bright yet hazy. Its long, slender body radiated intense heat. It was the rare fire-type treasured panacea, the Tai Fire Longfruit. Neither of them could identify the specific Fire Dao. It was clearly not Merging Fire, but the brilliance of the flames was unmistakable.

The two quickly packed everything away. Li Xijun summoned Li Chengliao and handed off the remaining matters to him, giving instructions, “Senior White Banyan is still waiting in town, I shouldn’t keep him waiting. I’ll head over now.”

Li Ximing nodded as well and went down to enter seclusion. Li Xijun rose with the wind, glancing across the southern and eastern shores, where his family’s banners now flew. Nearly half of the vast Moongaze Lake was under his family’s control.

He gazed quietly for a moment, recalling his conversation years ago with Li Yuanjiao about unifying Moongaze Lake and relocating the family to that land. That dream no longer felt so far away.

I need to work harder.

He drifted down on wind and snow, entering Lijing Town. As he landed nearby, he saw a bustling crowd. Many family men had gathered beneath a side hall, all looking up toward a specific spot.
𝗳𝐫𝚎𝗲𝚠𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝘃𝚎𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺

Li Xijun was slightly taken aback. There was White Banyan, one leg crossed as he sat on the rooftop eaves, the other leg dangling and swaying atop the tiles. He held a bowl of purple fruits and he was grinning down at the crowd below.

As he ate, he casually tossed fruits down and prompted the crowd to reach up eagerly as his eyes gleamed in anticipation.

“Truly a fox’s nature.” Li Xijun chuckled. The crowd of family men immediately grew nervous and dropped to their knees. He descended for a closer look and saw that they were all mortals. He waved them off and took to the air once more.

White Banyan, looking a little guilty, hurriedly tucked away the bowl of fruit and quickly changed the subject, asking, “How did it go?”

Li Xijun bowed respectfully and said with a smile, “Reporting to the senior. It went smoothly, of course.”

“Ohhh, very good.” White Banyan nodded, and Li Xijun led him all the way to Mount Qingdu, explaining, “Our family has now relocated to this mountain. If the senior visits again, you can come directly to Mount Qingdu.”

White Banyan acknowledged with a quiet hum, then lowered his gaze and said, “No wonder. I searched all over that mountain and couldn’t find Li Tongya’s grave… So it was moved. Let me pay respects to the departed first!”
