# Chapter 573: Zhong Qian

After Ning Heyuan finished speaking, the two understood each other's intentions. Li Qinghong then asked about the treasures in the cave dwelling, and Ning Heyuan, hearing her description, replied softly, "I will send someone to investigate right away."

Li Qinghong nodded. Ning Heyuan hesitated for a moment before saying, "Brother-in-law, there is news from the sect."

Li Qinghong, catching the subtle hint, respectfully excused herself and withdrew. Once she was gone, Li Xuanfeng turned his attention to Ning Heyuan, who continued, "The market at Unison Sea has been attacked again by that water ape. Do you want to seize the opportunity and head over there yourself, or should I send someone to take care of it?"

This water ape was an issue that Yuan Su had previously mentioned, and Li Xuanfeng had no intention of letting Ning Heyuan handle it. He replied, "I will enter seclusion for half a month and then depart."

Ning Heyuan had only asked out of courtesy, as he wouldn't dare interfere in the Daoist Master's matters. He nodded and agreed, then accepted the Enduring Tranquility Spirit Pills that Li Xuanfeng handed him, who said quietly, "Exchange these for some pills that also aid Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation."

He cast Ning Heyuan a sharp glance and added in a serious tone, "Make sure they are pure."

Ning Heyuan hesitated briefly, then nodded with lowered eyes. "Understood."

He composed himself, took a small mirror from his sleeve, and handed it to Li Xuanfeng, saying, "The water ape is cunning and adept at concealing itself; it is quite difficult to deal with. This is the Glimmering Inquiry Mirror, a dharma artifact left here by the Daoist Master many years ago, specifically for detecting hidden forms."

Li Xuanfeng examined the mirror. It was a clear blue, about the size of his palm, radiant and crystal-clear, a finely crafted Foundation Establishment Realm artifact that seemed quite extraordinary.

Ning Heyuan explained, "This artifact contains a trace of divine ability, allowing it to detect illusions. Almost all concealment techniques below the Purple Mansion Realm... will be revealed when exposed to this mirror."

Li Xuanfeng studied it carefully and nodded, "A fine artifact."

With a respectful bow, Ning Heyuan retreated, leaving Li Xuanfeng alone in the cave dwelling, holding a jade cup in his hand, silent.

Once the stone door had closed, Li Xuanfeng pondered to himself, "A late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm water ape... to send me such a long way to deal with it... Yuan Su must have more in mind than just this. Is it a test... or an opportunity?"

Lu Xuanfeng speculated, "The Green Pine Temple ruins will open soon... if Yuan Su plans to send someone there, besides Ning Wan, I am likely the strongest among his followers. He would never risk Ning Wan, so it is most likely me..."

Reflecting on Ning Heyuan's earlier explanation of the Green Pine Temple situation, Li Xuanfeng finally felt some clarity. Perhaps Daoist Master Yuan Su had taken him under his wing all those years ago precisely with this matter in mind...

The timing seemed about right. After a moment of contemplation, Li Xuanfeng took several healing pills from his storage pouch, selected two suitable ones to consume, and entered seclusion in preparation.

Li Qinghong spent only a few days in the market before members of the Ning Family came to see her. Ning Heyuan arrived in a splendid robe, accompanied by two guest cultivators.

Li Qinghong had been training with her spear these past days, her hair bound and dressed in light armor, giving her a capable and spirited look. After a brief conversation, Ning Heyuan pulled a few red jade stones from his sleeve, lining them up from left to right, and said quietly, "Take a look, Qinghong. See which one best matches the description."

The Ning Family's wealth was immense, so they had obtained one sample of each possible spirit item. Before leaving, Li Qinghong had made one last visit to the cave and now pointed to the one on the far left. "My second uncle showed me before. This is the one."

Ning Heyuan sighed with a hint of regret. "As I suspected. From your description, it seems to be Earth-View Bloodstone. This item is barely considered a Foundation Establishment Realm spirit item, but it was highly valued a thousand years ago—even coveted by Purple Mansion Realm cultivators..."

After a quick calculation, Ning Heyuan explained, "As for its current worth... although rare, its value is not particularly high. But since you mentioned it is the size of a table, it could perhaps be considered a treasure."

Li Qinghong pondered for a moment and then said, "Please, tell me more."

Ning Heyuan cleared his throat and explained, "Earth-View Bloodstone is very effective in restoring missing parts and replenishing blood qi; it can heal severed limbs and is also useful for cultivating certain specialized spells... In the past... there were many spells that could not even be practiced without it."

Ning Heyuan elaborated, "Nowadays, though... blood qi can be purchased in any ordinary market, and with cheap alternatives available, this spirit item has long since fallen out of regular use... At best, it is simply high-quality blood qi."

"I see," Li Qinghong replied, with a slight smile appearing on her face. She thought to herself, This item may be worthless to them, but it is quite precious for my family.

Ning Heyuan continued, "As for that palm-sized golden stone, it is likely Altar Goldstone, which is very durable and serves as a Foundation Establishment Realm material! It can be used to craft dharma shields and similar artifacts, though it is a bit small."

He chuckled. "That is fairly common, though, since the Three Gold Fruition Attainment grows in the seas, and many spirit items come with golden stone byproducts. I would imagine more than fifty percent of your clan's mines produce golden stones, do they not?"

More than just fifty percent! All three of our family's mining veins yield golden stone! Even the Xia Family's Green Origin Copper Essence vein nearby is pure golden stone...! Li Qinghong grumbled inwardly but only smiled and nodded on the surface.

She then asked Ning Heyuan about the best methods for collecting the ores, planning to head to Zongquan Island with Li Xuanfeng once he had dealt with his current affairs.

————

Li Xuanfeng's wounds healed quickly. Although they had initially seemed severe, most of the damage was superficial, caused by physical strain rather than actual harm. With his talisman qi, such injuries were minor.

"Strength to Move Mountains, the progress has been immense over these years," he mused.

As Li Xuanfeng's cultivation advanced, the power of Strength to Move Mountains had also increased significantly. Combined with the treasures he had consumed from the Southern Border, his strength now surpassed even Foundation Establishment Realm demon beasts, allowing him to unleash such terrifying power with his Golden Age Longbow.

After giving Ning Heyuan a few final instructions, he took to the skies on his golden shuttle, heading northeast and riding along a series of water veins. The sea below his feet gradually turned a brilliant blue.

"Unison Sea." Li Xuanfeng muttered absent-mindedly.

Unison Sea lay at the opposite end from Scarlet Pristine Sea and was even larger in scale. It was the domain of the dragon clan, with its waters reflecting a rich azure hue. The sea stretched for thousands of li, with few islands and exceptionally deep waters.

Normally, under the sunlight, Unison Sea was a seamless blend of sea and sky—a striking sight. However, his timing was unfortunate, as an anomaly from the Eastern Sea had cast everything into pitch-black darkness, so thick that one could barely see a hand in front of them.

Li Xuanfeng broke through the darkened sea region and finally spotted a small island. It wasn't large—about the size of a small town—and was fortified with an earthen-colored formation, standing at the ready.

"According to the instructions, this should be the market town," he murmured.

He descended slowly, and sure enough, he saw signs of devastation along the coastline, evidence of considerable destruction. Puzzled, he asked himself, "What has gotten into this water ape? Azure Pond Sect is famous across the seas; it is as if the ape is tired of living..."

Just as he stopped, an elder flew out from the market town, casting a glance at him with a hint of uncertainty. "Are you General Li...?"

It was the first time Li Xuanfeng had been addressed as 'General' outside the Southern Border. He nodded. "That is right."

With a large hand, he touched the black-gold tiger emblem on his belt, producing a white command token. The elder quickly verified it and replied eagerly, "At last, we have been awaiting your arrival, my lord!"

The two descended, and Li Xuanfeng paused briefly before the formation. The elder caught on immediately, taking a formation token glowing with an earthy yellow light from his waist. The formation appeared to be operating at full capacity.

After taking control of the formation, Li Xuanfeng deactivated it with a light command. "With me on the island, there is no need for such heavy defenses."

"Yes!" The elder led him down with a respectful bow, introducing himself, "I am Yuan Huo'e, at your service, General."

Li Xuanfeng glanced at him and asked, "The Yuan clan of Mushroom Forest Plain?"

"The very same!" Yuan Huo'e answered.

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly, recognizing the connection between their families. Wasting no time, he got straight to the point, "What is the situation with the water ape?"

Yuan Huo'e shook his head and sighed. "This creature is part of the dragon clan... it has some backing and does not fear us. Its strength is formidable, and it has beaten us so badly we do not dare step off the island... this has been dragging on for nearly half a year, disrupting our business considerably. We have already evacuated all unrelated personnel from the island."

"A member of the dragon clan?" Li Xuanfeng was slightly surprised, but recalling Yuan Su's earlier words, he immediately considered, Could it be that Yuan Su intends for me to serve as a pawn to provoke the dragons and ultimately throw me under the bus to take the blame?

Running through his thoughts quickly, Li Xuanfeng felt a surge of doubt, his initial judgment beginning to waver. He thought to himself, Something is not right... This market isn't Ning's property; it's a sect-owned business, and at most, it could be considered a Chi Family asset. Why would Yuan Su go to such lengths to help others for no gain?

Settling his mind, he asked, "Why is this water ape giving you such trouble without reason?"

Yuan Huo'e, noticing Li Xuanfeng's contemplative expression, had initially held his tongue. Now, he replied in a low voice, "We asked that very question some time ago. The water ape claimed that someone stole his precious herbs and is hiding in the market... He demanded that we deactivate the formation so he could search freely. But how could we allow that? If we opened the formation, he would do whatever he pleased."

Li Xuanfeng paused, then said quietly, "Take me down. Prepare a report detailing all the water ape's Immortal Foundation abilities, dharma artifacts, and techniques."

Yuan Huo'e led him to the most lavish hall, vacating it for his use. He handed over a small note, then, seeing Li Xuanfeng wave him off, wisely took his leave.

Li Xuanfeng read the note aloud, "Water ape... brutal by nature, with a fondness for human flesh, and his Dao foundation is Secret White Mercury... rather unusual... capable of concealing himself, lurking in the sea, with a body like polished silver and skilled in spells... no wonder he caught the attention of the dragon clan."

Yuan Su's exact words were that the water ape is the primary target of this mission. Under no circumstances should it be allowed to survive; there's no path to reconciliation. Li Xuanfeng held the note in silence, mentally reviewing Yuan Su's arrangements and deducing, The water ape likely misread the situation. This claim of stolen herbs hidden on the island is probably true... and that makes the situation clear.

He flew up from the hall, ascending above the island, and retrieved a small, blue mirror the size of his palm from within his robes, the Glimmering Inquiry Mirror.

Is this mirror meant to search for the water ape? I doubt it. Li Xuanfeng activated the mirror, closing his eyes as bright blue light streamed from its surface, sweeping across the island. This mirror was certainly not as refined as his family's mirror; he had to channel his mana for several breaths before the scene below became clear.

The island was now occupied solely by Azure Pond Sect cultivators, all wearing green robes. In the center of the island, at the spot with the densest spiritual energy, a lone figure sat cross-legged—a young man in deep meditation.

A peak Qi Cultivation Realm... If his instincts were correct, this young man was undoubtedly the one the water ape had been hunting. Noticing the youth's cultivation level, Li Xuanfeng muttered under his breath, "Peak Qi Cultivation Realm? Stole precious herbs? He must have a thread of fate."

As he pondered, clarity settled in his mind. "It seems the water ape does not understand the situation. It has foolishly entangled itself, trapping this young man on the island and delaying the affairs of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Yuan Su sent me to kill it, to clear the path for this youth."

He nodded slightly. As for the water ape... it was likely that its fate had become entangled in some way. Perhaps its backing had chosen to ignore it, or it had unknowingly offended someone, or it was caught in a factional struggle after the fall of its demon king, now destined to serve as a sacrificial pawn.

His gaze returned to the mirror in his hand, and a sense of doubt rose in his heart, There was no need to give me this mirror... I could simply eliminate the demon. Yuan Su's intention... is likely to offer me an opportunity.

With this thought, the black-gold armor on Li Xuanfeng's body began to manifest, and the golden bow appeared with a fierce glint. He descended on the wind, landing silently beside the young man.

Quite the choice—this is one of the best cultivation spots on the island. He remained silent, standing quietly with his hands clasped behind his back next to the youth.

The young man had a refined face and sharp eyes, dressed in neat attire. Though not particularly handsome, he possessed a striking presence. Li Xuanfeng observed him briefly, thinking to himself, The nature of fate is truly extraordinary... what sort of power must it be to allow someone to repeatedly avert danger?

The youth's eyelids twitched slightly before he slowly opened his eyes. His gaze was deep, but upon seeing Li Xuanfeng, he froze, his face paling in shock and disbelief, "W-what!"

He had merely been meditating, yet suddenly, a middle-aged man clad in black-gold armor, with an eagle-like gaze and imposing mid-Foundation Establishment Realm aura, had appeared before him. Terrified, the youth instinctively leaped up, though his usual composure faltered for a moment.

But almost immediately, his mind raced, and he dropped to one knee in respect, speaking in a steady voice, "Junior Zhong Qian greets Senior! I entered this blessed land by mistake... I beg for your forgiveness!"

Having quietly occupied someone else's cultivation ground, only to be caught red-handed, Zhong Qian found himself in an incredibly awkward situation. Unable to come up with any smooth words, he could only state his case plainly, subtly gripping a talisman in his sleeve and scanning his surroundings with his spiritual sense in vigilance.

Zhong Qian mused, This is troublesome... this formation could protect me... or trap me within.

Li Xuanfeng regarded him calmly and said quietly, "There is no need to be tense... and as for that talisman, you do not need to clutch it so tightly. I am not like those weak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators; even an ancient talisman would not last two strikes against my arrows."

Zhong Qian, shocked at being so easily seen through, replied respectfully, "I truly had no other options, which is why I took shelter in this blessed land... I am willing to offer a spirit item as compensation..."

Cautious one, this little guy, Observing the youth's taut stance, ready to flee at any moment, Li Xuanfeng spoke again, "You did well... That water ape crossed your path and was fated to meet this calamity."

So, he is an enemy of that demon! No wonder! Relieved, Zhong Qian also sensed a certain meaning in Li Xuanfeng's words and respectfully replied, "I am not a disciple of any prestigious sect... merely a rogue cultivator from the Eastern Sea. That water ape devours humans daily. When I accidentally entered its cave dwelling and took its precious herb, it pursued me all the way to your market. I have been unable to leave since."
