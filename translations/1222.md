# Chapter 1222: The Invitation

"I wonder how much time we have left."

Liu Changdie gazed at the lingering storm on the horizon, stroking his beard as he nodded. Li Jiangqian, however, showed no hesitation and said:

"I fear it is imminent."

There was no other reason. In Li Jiangqian's view, allowing Qing Jifang's chaotic situation to fester was, in essence, an implicit challenge to his own father. It was merely a test of his father's condition, an attempt to stall for time while his injuries remained unhealed.

'Between the north and south, neither side will object to this probe; that being the case, the sooner, the better. The power I've amassed by establishing the formation in the great desert is not enough to frighten them into retreat.'

'But if they wish to meddle with Moongaze Lake as it is now, it will still cost them considerable effort!'

He merely suppressed this thought, a smile playing on his lips as he led Liu Changdie to the side and whispered:

"Senior, please look at this!"

The jade box in his palm opened, revealing a shimmering, watery light, and nestled within was the golden slip!

To Li Jiangqian, the object held no obvious marvel, but Liu Changdie, as a Vault Metal cultivator, had his gaze transform in an instant. For a rare moment, his perpetually calm and smiling eyes betrayed a fiery excitement as he whispered:

"This… where did you get this?!"

Li Jiangqian's smile remained unchanged as he said:

"I knew you would like it, Senior!"

He evaded the question, but Liu Changdie, caught between surprise and excitement, did not notice, stating in shock:

"What do you mean, 'like it'? This is a Vault Metal Spiritual Treasure… an absolutely immense blessing!"

The shock in Liu Changdie's heart was simply beyond words—he considered himself a man of some fortune and destiny, having traveled north and south, far and wide across the four seas for years, yet he had never encountered a single Vault Metal spiritual item, let alone a Spiritual Artifact! The most compatible spirit embryo in his possession, which he cherished like a priceless treasure, had been seized from a grotto-heaven by Li Zhouwei.

And now he was being told there was a Vault Metal Spiritual Treasure!

"May I know its name?!"

Li Jiangqian smiled and said:

"It has an odd name, it's called the Profound Vault Invitation Letter."

Liu Changdie's gaze was one of utter fascination as he murmured softly:

"That's not odd at all…"

"'Vault Metal' is the principle of hoarded metal, be it in ore veins or hidden troves. Ancient cultivators used items like credentials or oaths as manifestations of Vault Metal, so using an invitation token as the corpus of a Spiritual Artifact is as suitable as can be."

"Is that so…"

Li Jiangqian nodded with a smile.

Liu Changdie could not tear his eyes away.

"I have heard of this type of Spiritual Treasure. To conform to the manifestation of Vault Metal, the refiner often uses great dharma power and divine abilities to conceal its true depths, referring to them as various kinds of treasuries. Because they are often used by way of invitation to lend their power to a junior, they are named as such!"

"It's just that…"

His gaze was fervent, keenly feeling that the Spiritual Treasure in his hands was without an owner. He held it as if afraid he would drop it, and asked in a low voice:

"Your Highness, this is…"

In his heart, Li Jiangqian had already made his decision.

'The relationship between my grand-uncle and this senior is already extremely close, and for the new great formation, this senior has exerted his utmost abilities without holding anything back… With old friendships and new graces, this is unavoidable.'

'Since the Dragon-kin chose a Vault Metal treasure specifically to compensate Liu Changdie, it would be difficult for my family to keep this Spiritual Treasure for ourselves. It wouldn't be appropriate for anyone to wield it other than this Senior Liu!'

For a variety of reasons, he had already resigned himself to parting with this item; he had not brought it out solely for the coming battle!

He understood that when bestowing a favor like this, one should not hesitate for too long. Even though his heart ached at the thought of losing it, he still smiled and said with great warmth:

"My family just acquired this item, and we immediately thought of you, Senior!"

But to his surprise, Liu Changdie before him stroked his beard as if to calm his excitement and said in a grave voice:

"Your Highness need say no more. To be able to hold this item and experience it for a moment is the greatest fortune of my life; how could I covet a Spiritual Treasure belonging to the Lake? For this battle, this Spiritual Treasure will be in my hands, and I will ensure its miraculous power is put to full use to protect the peace of the Lake!"

Li Jiangqian simply thought he was being polite; after all, who could hold a Spiritual Treasure of their own Dao lineage and not be moved? Especially for a path so broken that not even a single Spiritual Artifact could be found in the present age!

'If it were anyone else holding this, they'd be afraid I'd go back on my word. It's entirely possible they'd flee during the chaos of battle! Only with this senior do I dare to place my trust…'

He adopted a serious expression and said:

"Since you see me as one of your own juniors, Senior, how can you say such things? It makes it sound as if I only brought this out because a great disaster is upon us. That is truly improper!"

This was, in fact, the truth. It had not been an hour since Li Jiangqian obtained the item, and without so much as a proper look himself, he had immediately handed it over. Liu Changdie was rendered speechless by his words, and Li Jiangqian continued:

"If you insist on returning it, Senior, then you must take it up with my grand-uncle!"

Liu Changdie wanted to protest further, but he saw the solemn expression on the junior's face:

"The most urgent matter at hand is to quickly familiarize yourself with the Spiritual Treasure!"

Only then did Liu Changdie awaken from his intense joy and excitement, realizing that a great battle awaited him. He nodded deeply and, without any delay, carried the Spiritual Treasure into the great formation. As he felt his own divine ability continuously linking with the Spiritual Treasure, a profound sense of absurdity arose amidst his immense joy:

'How laughable… For a hundred years I couldn't find a single spiritual resource, and now, just as the thought arose, on my first time setting foot in Jiangnan, this Spiritual Treasure is delivered right into my hands! No wonder… no wonder those Daoist Masters would rather fight to the death in the mainland than go carve out a kingdom for themselves in the outer seas…'

'This world… is, in the end, a world upon a game board! Beyond the board… is mere survival, nothing more!'

…

The sky was dim, crows cried in the night, and a cold wind rustled through the mountain forest, carrying the faint clang of weapons. A man had already stepped out from the Great Void.

He was exceedingly tall and possessed a refined countenance, yet his lips were stained with blood. He had taken but a few dozen steps before he coughed up a mouthful of blood, which disintegrated into a jade-like, crystalline dust in mid-air, suffused with a penetrating chill.

'Wei Xuanyin's divine ability has improved again… He clearly hasn't perfected his final divine ability, yet its power is far greater than before…'

This man was none other than the Great Daoist Master of Western Shu, Wu Gan.

The Great Daoist Master flew for a while before he could bear it no longer, bending over again to cough violently. A full ten breaths passed before he finally spat out a ball of white mist. It swirled in the air for a moment before a living creature dropped out.

The thing was like a mouse, but not a mouse, and only the size of two fingers. It squeaked and tried to flee, but the Great Daoist Master didn't even spare it a glance, raising his boot to crush it. He let out a long breath, only then feeling the icy chill in his lungs lessen considerably:

'The Veiled Yin Dao of the Guanhua Daoist tradition is truly a miraculous power… not to be underestimated.'

In his youth, Daoist Master Wu Gan had roamed the world and actually had a friend from the Guanhua tradition. Now that this divine ability was used against him, he finally understood its fearsomeness. He wiped away the bloodstain with the back of his hand, his eyes filled with helplessness and suppressed gloom.

'To think I could be defeated so disgracefully!'

He looked up and saw the palace at the foot of the mountain gradually coming into view.

The royal court of Western Shu was situated at the foot of Mount Changhuai. Compared to the magnificent grandeur of Simin Prefecture, this court appeared stern, cold, and silent. There was not a single flicker of firelight, only the cold gleam of armor under the moonlight.

Daoist Master Wu Gan descended, just in time to see a man sitting before the court. His complexion was relatively fine, but his body was covered in glittering golden wounds. He was holding a flask of Valley Water and pouring it over his injuries. Upon seeing him, the man hurriedly said:

"Great Daoist Master!"

Daoist Master Wu Gan's attitude towards him was much better, but the disbelief in his eyes was hard to conceal as he asked angrily:

"King Quyang, how could the defeat have been so disastrous!"

This Daoist Master was King Quyang, Shangguan Mi. Hearing the words, he rose, glanced around, and said carefully:

"For this great defeat, at least twenty percent of the blame must be placed on Daoist Master Shen Sou… He failed to notice Jiang Yan's movements, which led to the ambush in the north. He has just been urgently recalled and has already entered the palace for an audience."

"Fifty percent is… that Jiang Yan…"

"He is truly formidable!"

His eyes were filled with gravity as he whispered:

"He charged into the battlefield with his divine ability. I caught a glimpse of him… it was truly like a god descending to the mortal realm. With one punch, he shattered half of Daoist Master Wang's face… That fellow is a ferocious demon. With several Great Daoist Masters absent, who could possibly control him?"

After saying this, he was unwilling to speak of the remaining thirty percent, but Daoist Master Wu Gan understood. The Daoist Master's unspoken meaning was that Qing Jifang was at fault for poor command!

Daoist Master Wu Gan could only shake his head and sigh:

'If I hadn't acted, they would have been routed long ago. I never thought that after surviving the most difficult pass, they would be beaten into such a state by a junior barely over a hundred years old…'

Naturally, these words could not be spoken. Not only could they not be spoken, but with Qing Jifang's character, he would absolutely never admit that it was his own problem. Jiang Yan was an enemy general, so retaliation was not something for the immediate future. Thus, the blame could only be borne entirely by Shen Sou.

'But if Jiang Yan truly used some kind of treasure, how could a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator see it clearly from across the mountains?'

Daoist Master Wu Gan shook his head coldly, then another doubt arose, and he asked:

"In that case, whether you are healing or guarding a prefecture, what are you still doing here?"

Shangguan Mi shook his head bitterly.

"I am waiting for our fellow Daoists… We are to depart immediately for Moongaze Lake."

"Moongaze Lake?"

Daoist Master Wu Gan was momentarily at a loss for words.

He had long known of Qing Jifang's intentions, and even knew that his return was nine-tenths aimed at striking the east. But he had never imagined that after suffering such a great defeat, the man had still not given up the idea, not resting for a moment before immediately wanting to use troops against the Great Song!

After a brief moment of shock, a deep chill was all that remained in Daoist Master Wu Gan's heart. He looked up at Shangguan Mi, and saw only bitterness in the other Daoist Master's eyes.

Daoist Master Wu Gan paused for a full ten breaths before finally asking:

"Who else wants to fight?"

Shangguan Mi shook his head.

'No one wants to fight.'

Newly defeated in the north and now marching towards the Great Song while still wounded, who knew if they would be plotted against?

'Except for the Sun Clan…'

When facing the Great Song, the most eager among the noble families of Western Shu was undoubtedly the Sun Clan. After all, they had a generational feud with the Chen family, and it was the perfect opportunity to use the world's shifting tides to suppress their rivals. Old Daoist Master Sun's injuries were no lighter than his, Wu Gan's, and Qing Jifang would push all the blame onto Shen Sou. The Sun Clan could barely protect itself, so they likely harbored thoughts of atoning for their faults through meritorious service.

Daoist Master Wu Gan sighed faintly and said:

"Let him do as he pleases. If he asks for me, just say I've gone back to heal."

Shangguan Mi looked as if he wanted to say something but held his tongue. After a long moment, he finally nodded and watched him depart. A moment later, the sound of rapid footsteps echoed as several figures strode out from the main hall.

The man in the lead was still Qing Jifang.

But his face no longer held the confident ambition of his northern campaign against Long. Instead, it was dark and held a suppressed fury. His aura was also unstable, seemingly vigorous but fluctuating erratically.

This direct descendant of a Golden Core master was clearly in a rage. Shangguan Mi did not dare to be negligent and hurriedly bowed, hearing the other man ask coldly:

"Where is Great Daoist Master Wu Gan."

Shangguan Mi lowered his gaze:

"The Great Daoist Master's injuries are quite severe. He has already returned to recuperate…"

Unexpectedly, the man before him fell silent for a moment and did not erupt in anger.

In this great battle, Daoist Master Wu Gan was the only Daoist Master who could claim to have done right by the Qing Clan. If he had not held back the Xiangxiong Kingdom in the rear, Qing Jifang would have long been caught in a pincer attack. A defeat under those circumstances would have been far worse than a simple ambush!

A thought stirred in Shangguan Mi's heart:

'This can also be considered a great service. Even if Qing Jifang is often extremely stingy with rewards and exceedingly harsh with punishments, he won't offer any commendation, but he can't say much either.'

Just as he thought, the man before him remained silent for a moment before moving on.

"Is there any news from Moongaze Lake."

As soon as these words were spoken, a chill went down the spines of the several men present. After several breaths, Shen Sou, who was in charge of this matter, had no choice but to step forward and say in a low voice:

"I was ordered to be on guard. At the time, I saw the sky filled with the light of Lesser Yang, which should mean the great formation has been completed. But I didn't have time to inquire in detail before rushing to reinforce the north."

"Completed?"

The words were like a bolt from the blue. Qing Jifang was so angry he laughed coldly and said:

"Are you telling me that in the time it took me to fight just one campaign, no more than three years, the Li Clan's great formation is complete? What, did Zipei come back to life to build it for him?"

But the Daoist Masters before him could not give him an answer.

In truth, by Qing Jifang's estimation, whether the formation in the great desert was completed or not had never been an important matter. Even if the great formation was finished, it was merely a matter of dispatching a few more Daoist Masters. Thus, even though he knew that the construction of the great formation on the lake was in full swing, he had dismissed it with contempt.

But he himself had never imagined that this campaign would end in such a disastrous defeat.

'Since Wu Gan is unwilling to come, I can only leave him to guard the north… If all the Daoist Masters from Jianghuai come to reinforce them, we might not actually be able to dismantle this great formation…'

His eyes showed more frustration, but his tone became level as he said faintly:

"Shen Sou, you will take King Fuen to rendezvous with Li Muyan and hold back the Song court's reinforcements."

He swept a cold glance over him and said:

"If you can hold them back, I will consider this matter an act of meritorious service to redeem your crime."

"Yes!"

Shen Sou's somewhat gaunt face was filled with reverence, but his hand clutching his dharma artifact was clenched tight. He summoned the wind and hurried south, while Qing Jifang, with a cold and sinister expression, slowly turned his head.

'Three early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators should be enough to handle Li Ximing and Li Jiangqian. Pushing a few more Purple Mansion cultivators from the noble families over there should be able to stall the reinforcements from Jianghuai. Add to that the Great Daoist Master from the Sun family and myself personally taking action…'

He said in a low voice:

"The rest of you, follow me to the great desert."

Shangguan Mi and the others could only rise with the wind, each with their heads bowed in silence. The Daoist Master gazed toward the east in a daze, his heart filled with doubt.

'I see another fit of malicious fury, a thunderous battle that will end with both sides grievously wounded. What is he doing… what benefit is there for him in forcing this fight… The Qing… is there truly no one who can dissuade him?'

His heavy gaze swept over the cultivators, quickly settling on a Daoist Master in unassuming bluish-gray robes standing in a corner.

Daoist Master Guanlan, Qing Zhuo.

This Daoist Master Guanlan was also of the orthodox direct line of the Qing Clan. Compared to the utterly unconventional Qing Jifang, Qing Zhuo's methods and temperament were superior by an unknown degree, yet he never took the lead in major affairs, only serving in an auxiliary role.

'Guanlan is far more suited to preside over Western Shu's affairs than Qing Jifang… Can the higher-ups not see this? Must they have this profligate who has indulged in pleasure for several hundred years preside over important matters, acting wantonly according to his whims?'

His gaze had only paused for a moment when that Daoist Master turned his head and nodded at him with a smile. For some reason, a chill ran down Shangguan Mi's spine, and he awkwardly smiled and retracted his gaze.

He traveled silently through the Great Void, a thousand thoughts weighing on his mind. After an unknown amount of time, a new idea surfaced:

'Does Changhuai truly regard the destiny of Western Shu as his own family's property…'
