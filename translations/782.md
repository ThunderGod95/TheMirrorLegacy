# Chapter 782: Inquiries

The Funan territory.

The arrays set upon the mountain peaks were already undergoing repairs. The land, once choked with black smoke, had begun to look orderly once more. The Golden Tang Gate had been forced to come, but they had no desire for wanton slaughter. The mortals below had suffered little damage and were now gathered at the foot of the mountains, rebuilding their flattened villages.

A streak of golden light sped through the air, transforming into a young man with the appearance of a scholar. His face was etched with worry as he flew, coming to a stop at the edge of the Funan territory.

Cui Jueyin had been searching for over half a year. Ever since Ding Weizeng vanished, he had scoured the entire region, but the jade pendant at his waist had shown no reaction. His search had taken him west to the Great Desert and east to the Eastern Sea; he had even secretly traveled north into the territories of the Golden Tang Gate and the Capital immortals Dao, but there was no trace of him.

He had no choice but to fly back, his heart half-frozen with dread.

Cui Jueyin knew Ding Weizeng well and held him in high regard. More importantly, both men had been personally elevated by Li Ximing and were the Daoist Master's trusted aides, standing on the same side. He was a pillar among the Foundation Establishment cultivators, and Cui had no intention of slacking in the search, giving it his absolute all.

He returned to the Funan territory, his spirits low. Not wanting to return to the lake just yet, he landed on Funan’s main peak. The cultivators below did not know him well, but they recognized his face and hurried to greet him.

“Lord Cui, the lake sent Lord Qu to manage the cleanup. He has been sorting out the spiritual fields and is currently free in the main hall.”

Hearing this, Cui Jueyin turned toward the hall. Moments later, he saw the old man sitting within, draped in a rather magnificent robe and holding a box of soil, which he was examining intently.

“Senior Qu!”

Cui Jueyin offered his greeting. Qu Bushi immediately rose and strode forward to meet him, sighing.

“Lord Cui, we’ve been anxiously awaiting you. Things at the lake have been busy… Any sign of Weizeng?”.

Qu Bushi was actually very close to Ding Weizeng, often referring to him as ‘Weizeng’ as one would a junior, and he was deeply agitated by the matter. His first question was for news. When Cui Jueyin shook his head, the old man’s expression turned grim.

“He should be alright…” Qu Bushi murmured. “After all, his life jade at the lake has dimmed, but it hasn’t changed. As long as a Purple Mansion master didn’t strike him down, Weizeng is likely in seclusion somewhere.”

Cui Jueyin mused, “I have one more idea… The Northern Brocade River King… is there any news of him? Demons infest the three rivers; perhaps we can ask him to make some inquiries”.

At the mention of this demon, old man Qu sighed again. “We already thought of him. But that old demon, whether by cunning or by chance… went off nearly two years ago to celebrate the birthday of some Xu Water Demon King and hasn’t been seen since. Our messengers… their messages are just piling up in his river palace with no reply”.

“The Xu Water Demon King?”.

Cui Jueyin, having come from overseas, immediately caught the significance of this name. He frowned. “I know of this Xu Water Demon King. He supposedly visited Chongzhou Island with the Dragon King once. I never heard he was one for extravagance. A banquet lasting a year and a half ought to be over by now. I will go and ask”.

He had a feeling he knew what was happening. Taking the command token from Qu Bushi, he immediately sped toward Baijiang Creek. After covering most of the distance, he submerged himself and descended to the riverbed.

‘A figure as important as the Xu Water Demon King is cooperating with this,’ he thought. ‘Using a birthday celebration to move him out of the way… they must be afraid of dragging the Northern Brocade River King into this mess. When it comes to inland affairs, the dragon lineage ultimately chose not to get involved…’.

Cui Jueyin saw the truth clearly. While the dragon lineage was signaling its withdrawal, this did not mean the rumored connections were imaginary. On the contrary, the connection had to be real for them to mobilize a Purple Mansion demon like the Xu Water Demon King to coordinate this...

‘If the rumors were baseless, the Northern Brocade River King could have just stayed put and ignored any requests for aid. Why else would he go to all this trouble?’

‘Our only hope of finding the Daoist Master and the Family Head... rests with this flood dragon!’

With this understanding, his actions became more assured. As he approached the river palace, a fish demon emerged. Cui Jueyin had some experience dealing with demons and explained his purpose clearly.

“My King only just returned this morning and was about to send a reply,” the demon said. “Please, Lord, come in”.

Cui Jueyin strode confidently into the palace. It was a scene of shimmering gold and brilliant splendor. Demons had no sense of restraint; the steps leading to the high throne were an extravagant mix of gold and precious spiritual materials.

Upon reaching the main hall, he saw a tall, stately man dressed in a magnificent brocade robe of slate-blue cut silk and a cape of white fur embroidered with an azure sea. If not for the shimmering, sapphire-blue scales on his neck, he could have passed for the master of any great sect.

“This humble cultivator, Cui Jueyin, pays his respects to the Northern Brocade River King!”

He bowed his head and stated his name. The man flicked his robes and descended the steps, smiling.

“Chongzhou Island?”.

“Indeed!”

One was a demon, a servant of the dragon lineage; the other was from an overseas family, a descendant of Chongzhou. Neither man lacked for worldly knowledge, and both knew many secrets. They were, in fact, both subordinates of the dragon lineage. As the man and the demon met each other's gaze, a volume of unspoken secrets passed between them.

The Northern Brocade River King, Ying Hebai, gestured for him to take a seat. “Chongzhou is also under the protection of the White Dragon lineage,” he said in a low voice. “Years ago, the Dragon King brought my own King along to accept this charge, forging a bond. My connection to Xu Water is also close. We are all one family”.

“Naturally.”

Cui Jueyin replied with an easy smile, inwardly noting that Ying Hebai seemed to know a great deal.

“I only learned of Brother Chenghui’s fall after I returned to the sea,” Ying Hebai continued, his voice low. “But even if I had been here, I could not have changed anything… I must ask you, Lord Cui, to speak a few good words on my behalf”.

“I am, after all, a minor player on the periphery. I can help pass a message or two, but I cannot do more. I was waiting for you… From now on, any dealings must be counted as a private friendship between us.”

Cui Jueyin naturally nodded. “The lake sees the situation clearly. This was always coming. When Situ Tang achieved the Purple Mansion, he still faced the calamity of having his mountain besieged. When Xiao Chuting attained his divine ability, he was likewise trapped in the Eastern Sea. Moongaze Lake could not expect to be an exception. That the Daoist Master was able to escape overseas is already the best possible outcome.”

Seeing Ying Hebai nod, he lowered his voice. “We have been targeted recently. My only true concern is the matter of the White Qilin entering the sea. Has His Majesty heard any news?”.

Ying Hebai shook his head. “There is no need to worry. Since he used the Sword Gate’s rigid morality to preserve his life, he has slain Situ Mo and fled to the Eastern Sea. It is unlikely any further harm will come to him. The one in an awkward position now is Cheng Yan. I heard from my Demon King that the man has a terrible reputation—reviled by everyone. With Changxiao gone, he would never dare pursue anyone into the Eastern Sea”.

Cui Jueyin immediately understood, and a great weight lifted from his heart. He then changed the subject. “What of the Daoist Master?”

Ying Hebai’s response was immediate. “I was in the Hetian Sea at the time. I know no details of the matter”.

Whether he knew or not, he must have heard something. His eagerness to avoid the topic was a clear signal. Cui Jueyin tactfully shut his mouth, clasping his hands. “Then I must ask the Demon King to help the lake with another matter, to search for a certain Daoist friend…”

A smile finally touched Ying Hebai’s lips. “On that, I have good news for you. Daoist Friend Ding is right here in my river palace, healing from his injuries!”.

Although Cui Jueyin had suspected he might know Ding Weizeng’s whereabouts, he never imagined the man was in the palace itself. No wonder he couldn't find a single trace. He was instantly overjoyed. “My deepest thanks to you, Your Majesty!”

Ying Hebai led him down through layers of coral, soon arriving before a palace of azure bronze. Cui Jueyin waited only a moment before a burly man with the whiskers of a tiger rushed out from within.

Ding Weizeng’s aura hadn't changed significantly, but his eyes were filled with anxiety. The large man rushed up and seized Cui Jueyin’s hands.

“Is there any news of the Daoist Master?!” he demanded.

Cui Jueyin, stunned that this was his first question, uncertainly shook his head.

Ying Hebai smiled. “Daoist Friend Ding fell into the creek. My little sister found him and brought him back, placing him in my palace’s Pristine Water Pool, which healed his wounds. Any slower, and he would have been left with permanent internal injuries that nothing short of a Purple Mansion cultivator could have fixed.”

Cui Jueyin nodded slightly. Ding Weizeng spoke in a low voice, “The Golden Tang Gate besieged me. I used my Immortal Foundation to escape but was severely wounded. I originally fled to the desert, but I was worried about Chenghui. I tried to come back, but I delayed too long, and the injuries were too severe. I fell somewhere in the west.”

“I was unconscious for a long time. I was awakened by several mortals who were fleeing here from the Golden Tang Gate’s territory. Once I was awake, I secluded myself for half a day, then continued flying east. Halfway here, I ran into demonic cultivators. I killed them, but the effort triggered my wounds, and I fell into this river…”.

Ding Weizeng made it sound simple, but to repeatedly lose consciousness was no small matter. A Foundation Establishment cultivator’s injuries would not cause them to lose their senses unless they were truly on the brink of death. If not for the tenacity of his Immortal Foundation, he would have long since perished.

Cui Jueyin let out a deep sigh. “Since you were here healing, why didn’t you send a letter back? You have caused me a bitter search.”

But Ding Weizeng replied in a low voice, “When Miss Ying brought me back, I didn’t know the situation. But I inquired about the present state of affairs and learned the lake was not in danger. I only wanted to use this treasure-land to heal as fast as possible, so I could go to the Eastern Sea and search for the Daoist Master…”

Cui Jueyin understood. The man before him was genuinely worried about Li Ximing. This man felt little belonging to Moongaze Lake itself and had no interest in the clan’s power; his loyalty was to Li Ximing, and to him alone.

“Alas… how can a single Foundation Establishment cultivator find what several Purple Mansion masters cannot? Even if you found him, what help could you be? You should return with me to the lake. We must stabilize the situation at home first.”

Ding Weizeng shook his head. “That is not necessarily true. If the Daoist Master is injured and has no one attending him, there is certainly risk. As for whether I can find him… even if I just search outwardly, I might draw the attention of those with ill intent. That, too, would be good for the Daoist Master!”.

‘Draw the attention of Purple Mansion masters… He’s willing to throw his life away!’

Cui Jueyin, though loyal to his duty, knew he was incapable of sacrificing his own life in such a way. He sighed inwardly. Seeing that Ding Weizeng was about seventy or eighty percent recovered, and hearing his tale of grievous injury—all healed in merely half a year—he instantly understood that Ying Hebai must have used considerable spiritual treasures. The clan now owed a debt. He could only bow.

“On behalf of the lake, I thank His Majesty!”

Ying Hebai laughed and waved his hand, escorting the two men out of the palace. He nodded as they parted. “I heard that Daoist Master Zhu Gong from overseas has recently been a frequent guest at the Purple Smoke Gate. There may be more changes coming. It would be best for the lake to be careful.”

***

Moongaze Lake, Vermillion Bud Pavilion.

The lake water rippled under a perfect sky. The light from the bluestone lanterns had been extinguished. The woman in the pavilion, wearing a long skirt with several talismans affixed to her sleeves, had one hand covering a cloth map marked with dozens of notations, while the other rested on an azure jade mortar.

“Three qian of ochre, three qian of metal essence, five fen of White Origin, one and a half qian of roasted golden silkworm… There should be no issue. It’s strange, why won’t it manifest…”

(T\L Note: Qian is 5 grams, Fen is 0.5 grams)

She observed the half-gold, half-black powder at the bottom of the mortar. When it stubbornly refused to turn platinum, she cut off her spiritual qi and set the jade pestle down.

‘Could it be because of the current spiritual environment, Inward Heart Surging Profundity?’ she mused. ‘Metal is the child of Earth, and this aura damages Earth. There is not enough gestational energy, so the child cannot be born. If I add another half-qian of ochre, I can try again.’

She pulled a jade box from her sleeve, revealing chunks of crimson ochre spirit stone. Just as she was measuring it, a cultivator reported from outside the pavilion.

“My lady, the Third Young Master has arrived.”

“Please, show him in!”

Li Que'wan quickly put her things away and stored the cloth map. As expected, the tall figure of Li Jiangxia strode up the corridor. He clasped his hands with a smile.

“Greetings, Sister!”

“Third Young Master.”

Li Que'wan invited him to sit. The young man raised an eyebrow at the jade mortar on the table. “I don't often come to visit, so it’s rare to see you. My apologies for the interruption.”

Li Que'wan picked up the mortar, her voice gentle. “It is nothing important. A branch of the clan obtained a new cultivation art from the Golden Virtue lineage. The problem is, the spiritual item they need for Qi Refining is not produced in Northern Yue; it comes from the Western High Plateau. They put in a request to the clan. I figured that since it's only a Qi Refining item, it wasn't too precious, so I’m trying to adjust the properties of other materials to create a substitute”.

Li Jiangxia nodded. He hesitated a moment, then slid a box out from under his sleeve. “I came today because I have something I need you to look at,” he said softly.

He placed the stone box on the table and gently opened it. Inside lay a dark, metallic stone. A subtle brilliance flowed across its surface, which was cut as smooth as a mirror, reflecting their faces.

She picked up the metallic stone, tested its weight, and observed it carefully. Surprise filled her face. “Where did you get this? This isn't Reflecting Metal or Geng Metal… it must be Wandering Metal! This is extremely rare in the south; it’s much more common in the north. I do not know its name, but this is without a doubt a Foundation Establishment-grade Wandering Metal spiritual item”.

“The north…”

Li Jiangxia silently processed this. ‘It seems Brother Pei’s legacy must have been left by a cultivator from the north…’.

He was about to ask more when someone hurried up from below, bowing respectfully.

“My lords! A message from the main island! Please come quickly!”

Li Que'wan immediately stood and handed the stone back. “Do they say what it is about?”

The messenger bowed. “Many people have arrived at the main island on a spirit-vessel, trailing Purple Qi. The vessel is incredibly lavish. It has already docked at the island’s edge.”

Hearing this, Li Que'wan understood at once.

“It must be the sisters,” she said to herself, “returning from the Purple Smoke Blessed Land!”.
