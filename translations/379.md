# Chapter 480: Arrival of the Kong Family

Li Encheng sat still, studying Li Xizhi's expression for a while before replying calmly, "I have my own people to handle this. Your family is an esteemed sword immortal clan, I can't possibly have you do such a thing. I'm merely looking for a sample of the Blood Sun Fruit on Mount Yue, and that Mount Yue Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator named..."

He paused for a moment, as if unsure what that Mount Yue cultivator's name even was. Fortunately, Li Xizhi stepped in, reminding Li Encheng of his name.

"Ah yes, Fu Daimu. He somehow found out about this and approached my manager at Xuanyuan Market and brought him there. In any case, it is not a big deal. I will have someone else continue the search, there's no need to trouble your esteemed clan!"

"As for the others..."

He narrowed his eyes slightly, lowering his voice before continuing, "I have no desire to cultivate friendships with any peaks. Please return to where you came from, back to Qingsui Peak."

"Understood," Li Xizhi replied. He offered an apology, then exited the hall without a change in his expression. As soon as he reached the steps outside, a middle-aged man approached him.

It was Li Encheng's second disciple. The man attempted to say something nice to Li Xizhi on behalf of his master, to which Li Xizhi smiled in response before leaving with the wind.

The middle-aged man entered the hall and saw Li Encheng sipping from a wine cup at the top. He lowered his voice and said, "Father! This is..."

Li Encheng shot him a glare, prompting the middle-aged man to close the door hastily and activate an isolating formation before continuing.

"This Li Family is our own, and it is very weak—merely a name at this point. They are just what we needed right now! The Azure Pond has had a firm hold over our people for so long and you've been thinking this for quite a while... Why drive them away?"

Li Encheng shrugged dismissively and replied, "Why does it matter? I've told him everything necessary. It doesn't matter whether my tone is harsh or not. Don't confuse Yuan Tuan and Li Xizhi with Si Yuanbai... Even Xiao Yuansi has his own agenda."

The middle-aged man recalled Li Xizhi's expression and nodded hesitantly.

————

Qingsui Peak.

Li Xizhi rode the wind back to the courtyard, closing the door behind him. Yang Xiao'er then asked, "What did Water Wall Pearl say?"

"It's settled."

Li Xizhi nodded with a smile. He then picked up a brush from the table and began writing a letter.

"... Have our prominent clans find the Blood Sun Fruit... Send it to the Azure Pond's sect manager at Xuanyuan Market. This person is Li Encheng's subordinate..."

Li Encheng was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator; how could he not remember a name? Moreover, Li Xizhi had clearly mentioned Fu Daimu's name. Li Encheng's behavior seemed intended to downplay this person's significance which was an unmistakable hint of his willingness to forge a connection with them.

He had also made his requests clear—first, to acquire the Blood Sun Fruit, and second, to contact him through his man at Xuanyuan Market, rather than return to Fuchen Peak.

"This person has kept to himself in the sect for many years; he certainly has his own reason..." Li Xizhi mused.

After a moment of contemplation, he set down his brush and turned to Yang Xiao'er.

"Xiao'er, I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you to head to the Imperial Cloud Peak to investigate what transpired before and after Li Encheng joined the sect... whether he offended anyone, and why he might feel silenced even in his own peak."

Although Li Encheng was a master alchemist, he was entirely at the mercy of Yundan Peak. Most of the favors he sought were funneled through them. He poured effort into refining pills and elixirs, only for the majority of the credits and benefits to be claimed by Yundan Peak.

His behavior had always been peculiar, leading others to believe he was indifferent. But now, Li Xizhi found this odd and did not want his father to act impulsively—he planned to uncover the truth first.

Yang Tianya must have covered for my family; he likely has ties to us or some connection to the Xiao Family. Going to Imperial Cloud Peak can help us gather real information without revealing our intentions.

He put aside his brush and took out the jade slip titled Six-Colored Essence Evasion. The senior who created this escape spell was obviously a vain person as the jade slip was colorful and engraved with intricate patterns.

When it comes to the brilliance of true essence, the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique is truly top-tier...

Li Xizhi spent the entire night studying the slip until Yang Xiao'er eventually returned with a frown.

"Li Encheng... has indeed offended someone!" she said seriously.

"Who?" Li Xizhi asked, looking up quickly.

He noticed the strange expression on Yang Xiao'er's face as she whispered, "Chi Wei!"

"Chi Wei?!"

Li Xizhi was taken aback, disbelief flashing across his features as he continued asking, "How is that possible?!"

Yang Xiao'er carefully checked the doors and windows, then used a secret technique to transmit her voice.

"Chi Wei was still at the Foundation Establishment Realm when he went out with Li Encheng, and they discovered an alchemy legacy in a ruin. Li Encheng, tempted by profit, injured Chi Wei and locked him in a secret realm to seize this Dao for himself...

"He never expected that Chi Wei would gain significant benefits in the secret realm and later return to the sect. Li Encheng was apprehended for interrogation, relying solely on the backing of Fuchen Peak's Master, who defended him. Chi Wei, in a show of generosity, chose not to pursue the matter.

"The two reached an uneasy peace, and from that point on, Li Encheng never left the sect again. He spent his days refining pills on the peak, trying to atone for his past misdeeds..."

Li Xizhi shook his head upon hearing this and murmured, "I see, so that's why..."

Yang Xiao'er added, "Now that Chi Wei is dead, Li Encheng has become a cash cow for the sect. They've erased this part from the records and no longer mention it. It was the ancestor who informed me."

Li Xizhi nodded and reflected, "That certainly explains why Li Encheng rarely leaves his peak... It may not be that he's unwilling to go out, but that he dares not."

He retrieved a jade slip from the shelf and examined it closely before realization dawned upon him.

He whispered, "Ah, there's a brief record here. It was an alchemy legacy from the Mifan Sect... So that's the backstory of this legacy."

Yang Xiao'er nodded, reminding him, "This happened a very long time ago. Except for a few elders in the Purple Mansion Realm, most peak masters and disciples in the sect today are unaware of it, so we should be safe. My ancestor was just a lowly disciple back then. No one knows how much of what transpired in that secret realm according to the sect is true... We should just take it with a grain of salt."

Li Xizhi nodded thoughtfully, then picked up his brush to add a few more words to the letter before silently folding it. After sealing it with his family's secret technique, it was ready to be sent out.

The three treasured panaceas he received from Li Yuanjiao remained unused. Although his father had stated in the letter that if there was no hope of forming connections, he should keep them for his own use, Li Xizhi hesitated to pocket them all.

After considering his options, he carefully extracted one of the Cloud Vine Spirit Peppers, planning to have the Yundan Peak refine them into a batch of pills. As for the other two he set them aside, placing them in a small bag to be sent back home along with the letter.

Qingdu Peak.

Li Ximing sat by the furnace, a golden flame flickering across his face. With a light gesture, he drew the Profound Yang Radiant Fire to the tip of his finger.

The spirit fire was usually explosive and challenging to control, yet in his hands, it danced gracefully like an obedient spirit. Originally, it was a great spirit fire for combat, but unfortunately, they had only a portion at home and it had to be transformed into Long Marching Fire Essence.

As Li Ximing played with the fire, feeling its raw power and heat, a sense of regret washed over him.

He had received a talisman seed and having reached the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, Li Ximing was just one step away from the sixth heavenly layer.

After a four-month seclusion, he had easily broken through, breathing smoothly and effortlessly.

Talisman qi is indeed wonderful; it's a pity I can only take one dose. It would be wonderful if I could take several...

As soon as he emerged from seclusion after two months, Li Ximing felt restless. He called the servants from outside the courtyard and ordered, "Get Dou and the others here."

The servant, familiar with his intentions, was about to bow and take his leave when Li Ximing quickly stopped him, "Wait! Someone is coming."

The courtyard door creaked open, revealing a young man in a white robe. With sharp eyebrows and bright eyes, his true essence radiated a chill that was as cold as snow. He smiled and said, "What a coincidence! You've emerged from your seclusion, Ximing!"

Li Xijun, now also at the fifth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation, had received a Foundation Establishment Realm talisman alongside Li Ximing. After a series of breakthroughs, both were a level above Li Xizhi in the sect and firmly established themselves as mid-stage Qi Cultivators. Only Li Xicheng, who was at the foot of the mountain, remained at the second heavenly layer.

The two brothers sat down. Li Ximing still felt slightly awkward, but Li Xijun did not address it directly; instead, he shared everything that had happened during Li Ximing's seclusion, including details about two ore veins.

Li Ximing listened, genuinely pleased.

"That's great news!" he exclaimed.

Li Xijun continued, "Second Uncle has been in seclusion to recover from his injuries. I spent the last two months gathering qi and practicing the Slaughter Jun Kui Light. I visited two markets and bought all the spirit items and spirit herbs you need for the Yang Nourishing Technique."

He then produced an array of items from his storage pouch—A spirit stone with a phoenix tail pattern, a warm jade bottle, and a red spirit herb among them.

"This is the Phoenix Tail Stone, this is Dark Gray Smoke, and this is Yang Essence Spirit Herb..." he explained, handing them to Li Ximing one by one.

He noticed Li Xijun's travel-worn appearance and quickly thanked him, placing the items on the table. Feeling shy about expressing more, he only managed to convey his gratitude.

Li Xijun waved his hands, dismissing the formality.

Now that his cultivation had improved, Li Xijun had begun practicing Spirit Eye Perception. His eyes shimmered as if he could see right through people.

He spoke softly, "Granduncle has been looking very exhausted lately. He must be haunted by his inner demons, though he refuses to say a word about it. You should refine more pills that can help to relax him. I'll try to ask a few people to go to the southern prefecture to search for other similar medicines... It just so happens that I need to find a type of spirit water, so I can handle both tasks together while I'm at it."

Li Ximing heeded the instruction with a nod. Li Xuanxuan was his grandfather, and he should have been the one most concerned for him. Yet, he had been practicing in seclusion, wasting precious time.

Feeling a pang of shame, he replied, "I'll get to work right away and be more attentive to Grandfather's needs in the future so you don't have to worry about it."

Li Xijun smiled and nodded. Curious, Li Ximing asked, "Is the Slaughter Jun Kui Light really that difficult to practice? We already have cold water and cold qi at home, and also obtained one from the Yuan Family. With three cold qi from the Chilling Snow Series and a method for finding cold water... Do you really need to go out?"

"The only thing missing now is the cold water. My Radiant Snow Pine Ridge excels at using spells, and Slaughter Jun Kui Light is exceptionally powerful in my hands," Li Xijun replied with a smile.

He extended two fingers. Positioning his thumb at the base of his index finger, he began to chant the incantation. Suddenly, strands of white cold light scattered from his fingertip, glowing brightly in the air.

Li Ximing felt a chill wash over him, causing the hairs on the back of his neck to stand up. A layer of white frost quickly formed on the ground beneath him, and the flow of true essence within his body soon became sluggish.

Since there were spirit materials on the table, Li Xijun suppressed his power and only demonstrated a fraction of his power before waving his hand to dispel the spell.

"Slaughter Jun Kui Light is not just cold; it's also infused with Yin energy. Once I acquire the spirit water, I can elevate my abilities further. By then, even if my opponent's cultivation is significantly higher, they'll still suffer terribly if caught off guard during battles."

Li Ximing looked on enviously and remarked, "It's a pity that my skills are rooted in the Golden Yang lineage and I can't practice that... While the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual is excellent, it lacks compatible spells and escape techniques."

As they conversed, a delicate shout resonated from outside Mount Qingdu's formation.

"Kong Family of Profound Peak Gate has arrived as promised. Please open the mountain gate!"

The two brothers exchanged surprised glances and swiftly flew upward.

Outside the formation stood a graceful woman in plain clothes, adorned with a golden pearl at her waist and two curved blades hanging by her side. She was accompanied by an ordinary middle-aged man who remained silent.

What a beautiful woman!

Li Ximing had a calm demeanor. Although he still felt attracted to beautiful women, he was not so lustful as to lose his composure. Recognizing that she was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, he lowered his gaze and dared not look directly at her.

Li Xijun cupped his fist and asked, "Are you Senior Kong Tingyun?"

"Yes, and you are...?" Kong Tingyun glanced at him, secretly impressed, and explained politely, "I have once promised Brother Jiao to establish a fire vein for your esteemed family, and I've come as promised."

Splash...!

Suddenly, the dark green surface of Moongaze Lake broke open, and a young man in a black robe soared into the air. He silently stared at Kong Tingyun, his gaze lingering on the two curved blades hanging at her waist. His face darkened, and he stood there in silence.

Kong Tingyun cast a glance at him and felt a sense of familiarity. The next moment, she exclaimed in surprise, "You're that Hooked Serpent?!"

Li Wushao took a deep breath and replied humbly, "The Hooked Serpent is dead. I am Li Wushao of Qingdu... Greetings, Exalted Immortal."

Kong Tingyun's response was somewhat awkward. The long-buried doubts in her mind began to resolve by themselves.

So that's why Li Yuanjiao brought this Hooked Serpent back to the Li Family without any complaints... It seems he has a way to control demonic creatures. Given their family's proximity to the north, it's not entirely surprising.

Although it was awkward that the Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts at her waist were made from the Hooked Serpent's tail hooks, she had to be courteous toward the serpent who was now a member of the Li Family.

She silently stowed the dharma artifact in her storage pouch and replied, "Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak greets fellow Daoist."

Li Wushao's expression visibly improved as he quietly retreated to stand behind Li Xijun.

With Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong in seclusion, this responsibility naturally fell on Li Xijun.

He informed politely, "I'm afraid you will have to wait for a bit, Senior. My elders are currently cultivating in seclusion and unable to come out to greet you..."

Kong Tingyun waved her hand dismissively and did not seem to mind as she said, "I don't need to meet Li Yuanjiao. You can just show me the way to the mountain so I can open the fire vein for you. Once that's done, return the formation plate to me, and I'll take my leave. I don't have much time to waste here."

After a brief pause, Kong Tingyun asked with some concern, "Is Li Yuanjiao hesitant to see me because he has damaged the formation plate? That's a valuable item. If it's damaged, I expect a huge compensation from your family!"

"Don't worry, Senior. The formation plate is still in perfect condition," Li Xijun assured her.

The fire vein's location had been planned by the Li Family, specifically chosen at Mount Wutu.

Changes to the fire vein would affect the surrounding spirit fields. While the other peaks had large spirit fields, Mount Wutu was isolated in the mountains and forests, making it the only viable choice.

Kong Tingyun signaled, and the middle-aged man at the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm flew toward Mount Wutu. Li Xijun and his brother followed suit, watching from the air.
