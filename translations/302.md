# Chapter 337: Heavenly Pure Essence

The old cultivator was an unrefined Qi Cultivator at the fifth heavenly layer, but his cultivation had been sealed by An Zheyan. Blood covered his head and face, his beard and hair disheveled as he kneeled limply at the bottom of the stairs.

Dou Yi stood nearby, supporting him to keep him upright while reminding the man, "Rogue cultivator! You're in the presence of the Li Family's Young Master!"

The old cultivator remained silent, kneeling on his knees in a daze. Dou Yi raised his voice and called out to the old man again. Observing the furrowed brow of Li Yuanping, who remained seated, Dou Yi turned and called out to another person.

"Xu Gongming!"

Xu Gongming hurried forward, seizing the old cultivator by his collar and placing his other hand on the old man's back. After adjusting the old man's true essence, Gongming performed a series of hand seals and applied two Tranquil Mind spells. It was only then did the rogue cultivator stirred from his stupor, as if awakening from a dream.

"Gah!"

The old man coughed up two mouthfuls of blood, his gaze sweeping over the faces of the Li Family members. He whimpered, covering his face. Dou Yi moved to speak but was silenced by Li Yuanping's gesture, allowing the old man to sob.

Li Yuanping continued reading the letters on his table in silence as the guests from various families gathered around to observe the rogue cultivator. After a while, the old cultivator's sobbing subsided, and he opened his mouth to speak.

"Rogue cultivator Bi Huaxuan greets Young Master..." he said mournfully.

"Bi Huaxuan..."

Li Yuanping nodded, setting down his vermillion brush. He spoke warmly, "No need for such formalities, old man. Your name is familiar to me... You have traveled within our Li Family's territories and camped on the Guli Road for many years."

Bi Huaxuan nodded sadly, replying, "Yes... I have been traveling and trading along the road for six years now."

Since the destruction of the Yu Family's market, Moongaze Lake had lost another place to trade. Cloud Crowned Peak in Lixia Prefecture was distant for those in the Embryonic Breathing Realm to reach, hence, Guli Road saw an increase in rogue cultivator traders like Bi Huaxuan, scraping together meager earnings in order to survive.

Li Yuanping, seeing the old cultivator now sober and capable of responding clearly, said, "All travelers on this road are welcomed by the Li Family. I apologize if there was any oversight on our part that led to conflict within our territory..."

His tone was mild and gentle, devoid of any threat. However, Bi Huaxuan, accustomed to the domineering behavior of noble families and immortal sects, trembled in fear.

He had fought over treasure within the Li Family's territory and was already feeling guilty enough. His sadness had not yet dissipated, but fear crept in upon hearing Li Yuanping's words.

Rogue cultivators held the lowest social standing, inferior even to the numerous small temples peppering the mountains. Knowing the Li Family was a Foundation Establishment Realm clan and not just some minor family, Bi Huaxuan bowed deeply.

"Young Master, we are innocent! We were ambushed..."

Without pausing to consider the reactions around him, Bi Huaxuan hurriedly recounted his sequence of events.

Originally from humble origins and working at the Moongaze Lake market, Bi Huaxuan had painstakingly become an unrefined Qi cultivator. He led a small group of mortals and a few Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators in search of fortune, and while traveling along the road yesterday with his merchant group, one of his disciples went off to relieve himself but never returned.

Bi Huaxuan, whose life had been adrift and felt he had reached a ceiling in his cultivation, particularly valued his disciples. Distressed by one's disappearance, he ventured into the Li Family's territory to seek him, thinking that it was probably safe with no powerful demons present.

After searching everywhere and shouting for hours, he discovered tatters of his disciple's clothes outside a cave. Casting a spell to investigate further, Bi Huaxuan came upon a vast expanse of sparkling water.

Looking up, he beheld an underground river that was flowing endlessly. Upon its surface floated a white object about the size of a fist, resembling water, but yet was not quite water. It bounced on the surface, crystal clear and glistening, rolling around in an oddly mesmerizing manner.

While everyone, including An Zheyan who listened intently, was captivated by Bi Huaxuan's story, Li Yuanping sensed that something was amiss and quickly interrupted him.

"Hold on. Someone, get Brother Jiao here!" he quickly instructed.

An attendant hurried off, and Dou Yi, having caught Li Yuanping's discrete signal, quickly followed up with another instruction.

"Everyone, you may attend to your own matters."

An Zheyan and the others nodded and withdrew from the room in an orderly manner. Bi Huaxuan, nervously scanning the room, found Li Yuanping's gaze fixed on him, silently urging him to continue.

Experienced in the ways of the world, Bi Huaxuan suddenly realized the significance of his find. His earlier concerns about his missing disciple faded into the background as thoughts of personal gain took over.

He swiftly dismissed his disciples and recalled the scene carefully in his mind. He felt his saliva sliding down his throat like jade liquid and his cultivation surging within his entire body, realizing that a golden opportunity had presented itself before him.

Bi Huaxuan began, his voice trembling with excitement and his eyes burning with greed. "According to the knowledge gained from my extensive journey, I think that substance I saw was likely known as the Heavenly Pure Essence—a legendary spirit water of heaven and earth! I-It can... It can..."

Li Yuanping gripped the armrest of his seat tightly with a hint of agitation, and finished the old man's sentence for him in impatience.

"Heavenly Pure Essence... This substance can strengthen spiritual sense, heal the wounds of one's foundation, purify true essence impurities, and bestow divine effects to those in the Embryonic Breathing, Qi Cultivation, and Foundation Establishment Realms!"

Heavenly Pure Essence, a rare spirit water of heaven and earth renowned for its unparalleled healing properties, held immense value in the paths of talisman arts and alchemy.

Li Yuanping had learned about it while discussing wound-healing methods with Li Tongya.

Li Tongya's immortal foundation was water-based, making Heavenly Pure Essence an extremely effective medicine for him. The prospect of speeding up Li Tongya's healing process by a few years and potentially further advancing his cultivation left Li Yuanping visibly excited.

Overwhelmed with excitement, Bi Huaxuan struggled to articulate his thoughts. Rushing into qi cultivation without acquiring a proper qi gathering technique had been his lifelong regret, haunting him to this very day.

Therefore, upon discovering the Heavenly Pure Essence, his heart surged like an unstoppable wave.

The spirit water could purify his unrefined qi, transforming it into pure qi. Although he would still pale in comparison to those who cultivated authentic techniques, it offered him a chance to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Bi Huaxuan quickly performed a series of hand seals and carefully secured the spirit water. However, just as he finished, a sudden scream echoed from outside the cave, and a figure dressed in black burst in.

"The man had pure, boundless true essence... My friends and I exchanged blows with him for over ten moves, but he overpowered us all, killing everyone else except me. I was left with no choice but to relinquish my storage pouch and flee, yet he continued to pursue me...If the guest cultivator of your esteemed clan hadn't arrived in time... this old man... would have been long dead...!" Bi Huaxuan wailed dramatically.

Upon hearing the rest of Bi Huaxuan's story, Li Yuanping's initial excitement turned into disappointment. He slumped back into his seat, angry yet unable to bring himself to vent his frustration.

He listened as Bi Huaxuan cried out, "My fate rests solely in your hands now! Please avenge me and claim this Heaven and Earth Spiritual Water for your clan! I have lost my life-long savings and disciples because of this man... Now I've nothing left! I beg you, please punish that man for this old man! I'm willing to give up the spirit water to your esteemed clan in exchange!"

Li Yuanping scoffed in response.

"Punish him? If that man has hidden in the forests, who could possibly find him? My family may be a prominent clan, but we are not a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan!"

Bi Huaxuan composed himself and pulled up his sleeve, revealing a jade bracelet with subtle patterns glowing faintly.

In a subdued voice, he explained, "I picked up these two jade bracelets from a market stall, intending to gift them... One has already been worn, while the other was in the storage pouch I've lost to that man."

"These bracelets can sense each other as long as they are not too far apart. Since the man is only at the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm and we fought a few hours ago, he cannot have traveled too far. He's likely recovering in the mountains... If we set out now, we may be able to catch him!"

Li Yuanping's face immediately lit up, a smile breaking through his stoic expression. He moved to take the jade bracelet but then hesitated. Settling back into his seat, he thought, I better wait for Big Brother to arrive first!

Li Yuanjiao had devoted himself to cultivating on Mount Wutu for a long time and was barely involved in overseeing the clan's affairs now.

The Qi Flow Spirit Swallowing technique had significantly accelerated his speed of cultivation and in just six months, he had already made remarkable progress.

Meanwhile, Xiao Guiluan had returned to her home. She had reached a critical juncture in her cultivation that necessitated her return to the Xiao Family to take the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath before she could learn the rest of her qi cultivation technique.

Li Xizhi, now eight years old, was a late bloomer and barely reached Li Yuanjiao's waist. Clutching a wooden slip, his youthful appearance was evident, marked by a hint of innocence in his brows.

"Father..." Li Xizhi began as he gripped the wooden slip tightly, looking up at his father with puzzled eyes, "Why must I read the Record of Immortal Ascension in the Prefecture? Brother Xicheng has already started spear training, yet I still have to read these strange books all day long..."

Li Yuanjiao patted Li Xizhi's head fondly. He opened his mouth but hesitated for a moment before replying, "Your mother borrowed this book because it details the relationships among the thirty-six peaks of Azure Pond and all the prominent clans... It’s important for you to understand these dynamics so that you can navigate the sect smoothly in the future and avoid unwittingly offending anyone."

Li Xizhi fiddled with the wooden slip, rolling and unrolling it repeatedly, seemingly agitated. After a moment of evident frustration, he looked up again and exclaimed, "Father... You’re really sending me to the Azure Pond Sect...!"

Li Yuanjiao sighed inwardly as he met his child’s mournful gaze.

"Zhi'er... my good boy, the teachings at Azure Pond are profound, and the spiritual qi there is much richer than here by the lake. Your talent is exceptional. In the future, you must cultivate qi within the sect and establish an immortal foundation. You are our family’s hope..."

Li Yuanjiao was never good at comforting children and tears began welling up in Li Xizhi's eyes as he listened to his father. He nodded vigorously, yet was unable to hold back his emotions.

Li Yuanjiao's troubled expression was tinged with guilt. As he pondered on what to do next, a clan soldier approached and respectfully announced, "Young Master, please come home. Young Master Yuanping needs to discuss something important with you!"

Relief washed over Li Yuanjiao. He wiped Li Xizhi’s tears and instructed him in a comforting tone, "Wait for me at the peak. Daddy will return soon."

With these words, he soared into the air, leaving Li Xizhi behind. The boy read his wooden slip for a while longer before tossing it aside in frustration and retreating to his room to sleep.

Li Yuanjiao flew all the way to Lijing Town and descended gracefully into the courtyard where his brother waited. Li Yuanping was examining the jade bracelet, scrutinizing the delicate pattern on its surface. Upon spotting Li Yuanjiao in his black attire, he hurried over to greet him immediately.

"Big Brother! There's news regarding the Heavenly Pure Essence!"

"What?!"

Li Yuanjiao's face lit up with joy instantly as he eagerly pressed for details. However, as Li Yuanping relayed the news, the joy dissipated, his brows knitting together in concern. Taking the jade bracelet, he closed his eyes to concentrate.

His spiritual sense flowed along the pattern on the jade bracelet before entering it, and he could immediately feel a subtle pull from a distance.

After a few moments, he opened his eyes, his expression now filled with doubt.

"The person is still on a mountain nearby..."

Li Yuanping, lacking the spiritual sense to utilize the bracelet, was stunned by Li Yuanjiao's revelation and murmured softly, "It's strange that he still dares to linger nearby after obtaining such precious spirit water..."

"As per the old rogue cultivator, this person was enveloped in mana light. Since he cultivates an authentic technique, he managed to defeat and kill many despite only being at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm... It's likely he's a disciple from an immortal sect!"

Li Yuanping pondered carefully with an uneasy look on his face before responding cautiously, "I wonder what his background and identity is... If he can act this fearlessly, he likely comes from a formidable background and is not an easy opponent to deal with."

Li Yuanjiao remained silent, scrutinizing the jade bracelet in his hand thoughtfully.

"Have you sent someone to investigate that cave already?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

Li Yuanping nodded and confirmed, "I've already sent Uncle Donghe there. He should be returning soon."

As they spoke, Chen Donghe hurried in, his attire impeccable and his sword swaying slightly at his waist. He stopped before the brothers, cupped his fist in respect, and reported, "I've inspected the cave. It’s a mess inside due to the fight. The walls are scarred and the ground is littered with stalactite fragments... Besides that, there wasn't much else to find."

"Thank you, Uncle Donghe," Li Yuanping responded. Chen Donghe nodded and cupped his fist once more, then exited the room.

Turning to his elder brother, Li Yuanping shared his thoughts.

"I was considering exploring the cave myself. With the Heavenly Pure Essence nurtured there, I believe the cave is anything but ordinary..."

Li Yuanjiao ascended a few steps, his gaze fixed on the jade bracelet as he traced the patterns with his thumb thoughtfully. Suddenly, he remarked, "This is too much of a coincidence."

Li Yuanping glanced at his brother, then fell into deep thought.

Li Yuanjiao continued, "Our Old Ancestor always warned us to remain cautious in handling family affairs... This situation reeks of coincidence... This person suddenly came and left, yet he lingers nearby after seizing the spirit water..."

"Brot-..." Li Yuanping began, but Li Yuanjiao raised his hand to cut him off. He performed a series of hand seals and began channeling his true essence.

His River True Essence, clear as turquoise lake water, enveloped the jade bracelet. He then stowed it into his storage pouch, explaining, "Guiluan mentioned numerous secret techniques that can manipulate minds and provoke desires through dharma artifacts... This incident is highly suspicious; we must be cautious."

"Yes. The Heavenly Pure Essence is undeniably tempting... Even I almost acted recklessly. After hearing your explanation, I believe your caution is well-founded," Li Yuanping agreed thoughtfully.

Li Yuanjiao nodded solemnly.

"Our family has ruled this territory for generations. I can believe that we've overlooked the spirit water all this time, but the sudden emergence of this jade bracelet is too convenient to be a mere coincidence."

The brothers' perspective had shifted significantly after the incident where Li Tongya was nearly turned into a sacrifice for the Maha Incarnate. They viewed the world much differently now than they did a year ago.

Li Yuanjiao chuckled wryly, remarking, "The so-called opportunities are often baits. They lure you in with promise, but the hidden traps that await are sharp and deadly..."

He continued, "Now that the old ancestor is gravely injured, I wouldn't have suspected anything if this were any other spirit water... But this is the Heavenly Pure Essence we're talking about."

The two brothers exchanged glances, and Li Yuanping sighed.

"The temptation is just too great... We don't know its true nature. If this is truly an opportunity, it would be regrettable to let it slip by."

"It doesn’t matter," Li Yuanjiao replied with a mysterious smile, then used mana to transmit his voice, "Have you forgotten we still possess an immortal item at home that can see a thousand li ahead, unhindered by any mountain or water body?"

"Ah, yes!"

Li Yuanping suddenly remembered the mirror, a family heirloom invaluable in times of crisis, yet he had momentarily forgotten its capability.

He pounded his fist in his palm excitedly and smiled.

"I'll go retrieve it from the mountain now!"
