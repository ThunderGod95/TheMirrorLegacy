# Chapter 1021: Brother-in-Law

Confronted with the question, Yang Ruiyi was silent for a long time. He clasped his hands behind his back and paced the pavilion, as if the words were too difficult to speak. After a heavy silence, Yang Xiao’er spoke first.

“I knew nothing about any of this before. Even when you told me about the Rainbow Glow opportunity on Mount Duan, I kept my mouth shut. I quietly accepted it, arranging for him to come here…”

“He sits on this mountain day after day, never taking a single step beyond its borders. And now, you’ve come to find me again. What else must I do?”

Her words filled Yang Ruiyi with sorrow. Visibly moved, he said, “If… if you resent Father for your current situation, it’s not right. Choosing a Dao lineage for him was meant to protect him. This entire marriage, from beginning to end, was all for the sake of you and Xizhi.”

“Even now, Father has made concessions for you. A place on Mount Duan… is not so easily obtained!”

Yang Xiao’er lowered her head, a faint smile on her lips. “What are you talking about? I chose this path myself. If I had to do it all over again, I would still go to Qingsui Peak. As for resenting Father…”

She shook her head. “There’s nothing to resent. Since he has entered the shadow world and now oversees the affairs of the Underworld’s deceased, he is merely a shade wearing a familiar face. Just like… just like the Great Ancestor. The moment he achieved his divine ability… he became someone we couldn’t even look upon.”

At his sister’s mention of the Underworld, Yang Ruiyi fell silent. He seemed unable to find a rebuttal, or perhaps, in his heart, he agreed. When she brought up Yang Tianya, a genuine shock flickered in his eyes. He lowered his gaze.

“We must not speak of such things. It is a great blessing that the Great Ancestor reached the Purple Mansion Realm, attaining a rank befitting an Exalted One. Were it not for the strenuous efforts of both him and the Exalted One, how could Father have come to oversee the dead? How could our family have received such a magnificent opportunity?”

He picked up a cup, and his ordinary face took on a noble, radiant sheen. He glanced at Yang Xiao’er.

“A few days ago, the Exalted One came from the Underworld and met with the White Qilin before returning swiftly. The immortal words spoken were few… Tianyou was fortunate enough to overhear a couple of sentences. She and I have been agonizing over their meaning ever since…”

This news was clearly momentous. Yang Xiao’er’s eyebrows shot up, her expression turning grave. “Is… is that in accordance with the rules? Why so soon?”

Yang Ruiyi gave a bitter smile. “You have to understand, this is a figure who once shared wine and conversation with True Monarch Cui. After the fall of Wei, his station in the Underworld has only risen. He can now ascend the steps to the Celestial Hall and participate in discussing the affairs of the dead. Who would dare say anything if he makes a brief visit to the mortal world, so long as he doesn't act?”

“Even Judge Jiang… must now bow his head to Him.”

A mix of worry and joy on her face, Yang Xiao’er paced the pavilion once. “What did Tianyou say?”

Yang Ruiyi’s expression was grim. “First: Save the man, not his line. Save the dead, not the living.”

Yang Xiao’er was momentarily speechless, a thoughtful look on her face. She lowered her head. “That’s not entirely unexpected.”

Yang Ruiyi paused before continuing. “Second… it concerns the situation in the north. This isn’t the place to discuss it in detail, so I can only say this… a great storm is brewing. With Father gone, I cannot watch over everything constantly. The Yang Clan will not restrain your husband, but if he leaves Mount Duan, the consequences will be severe. He will have to bear them himself.”

Yang Xiao’er’s head snapped up. She remained silent for a long moment. Yang Ruiyi met her gaze, his own open and honest.

“Xiao’er… you are my only sister,” he said with great solemnity. “This is the most your brother can do for you.”

But Yang Xiao’er had been deceived too many times. As if judging the truth of his words, she suddenly asked, “The Exalted One was willing to speak of such things with Tianyou?”

Yang Ruiyi shook his head. “Bright Yang is Bright Yang, after all. The Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate had its own connections to the Underworld in the past. It’s just that…”

He paused, choosing his words carefully. “When Great Ancestor Wei ascended as Monarch, he no longer trod in the Underworld or concerned himself with the affairs of the dead. Those matters were all handled by High Radiance. Thus, the Exalted One had frequent dealings with True Monarch Cui… there is a bond between them. That’s why Father was able to support the Ning-Li clan, and why the Exalted One turned a blind eye… and why he was willing to say a few extra words to Tianyou.”

With her last doubt dispelled, Yang Xiao’er gave a slight bow. “Many thanks, Daoist Master!”

Yang Ruiyi’s breath hitched. He looked at her deeply, his voice taking on a pleading tone.

“Xiao’er, your brother's opportunity and tribulation lie in these coming years. In terms of Dao-Profundity and strategy, I am no match for Father. Even he failed, so what chance do I have? I have cultivated a Dharma Body since I was young, but in the end, I am just a general… If I perish seeking the gold, then as you said, the one who arrives in the shadow world will no longer be me…”

“We are brother and sister, yet the days we have left to meet are numbered… and I may never hear you call me brother again.”

Tears welled in Yang Xiao’er’s eyes, but she smiled. “Then you will have to visit Mount Duan a few more times.”

Leaving a silent Yang Ruiyi in the pavilion, she turned and departed, riding the wind down the mountain path. Her face had already regained its usual calm. She ascended from a side trail, arriving at a small peak.

The peak was remote and rugged, lacking any magnificent palaces or grand structures. There was only a small pond, a simple thatched hut by its edge, a stone table, and a few stone chairs.

A middle-aged man in a straw cloak, his sleeves rolled up, was washing a sword by the pond. His back was to her, his emotions unreadable. The hand that held the sword was exceptionally steady, without the slightest tremor.

The sound of the water was pleasant. The snow-white blade rippled in the pond, casting shifting patches of white light onto his face and reflecting a pair of grey-black eyes, their sharpness concealed.

Hearing footsteps, the man looked up, revealing a gentle, refined, and scholarly face. A smile touched the corners of his eyes as he raised his brows.

“Xiao’er.”

“Husband!”

Yang Xiao’er’s expression instantly brightened. Her smiling eyes glanced at the cold steel glinting in the water. “Finished with your sword so early today?”

Li Xizhi helped her sit down. “It’s not so early,” he said softly. “Fellow Daoist Xishe didn’t come today. I practiced two sets of forms on my own before putting my sword away. I saw you arriving just as I finished.”

His wife smiled. “Xishe is certainly diligent. He even brought some cultivation resources over a few days ago. They weren’t exceptionally valuable, but for him, they were treasures. It shows his sincerity.”

Li Xizhi chuckled. He took a cloth from his sleeve and began to wipe the gleaming blade. “He is a man infatuated with the sword. He doesn't have ulterior motives. He simply knows he can learn from me and test his skills against the sword arts of the Chunyi Dao Gate.”

“I’m not afraid of him learning a thing or two,” he continued. “Since I’m confined to the mountain and cannot go out, it would be a good thing if I could earn a bit of goodwill from him, perhaps to help our family’s younger generation, or those few disappointing disciples of mine.”

The man looked up, his gaze gentle. “You went out?”

Yang Xiao’er fell quiet for a moment before sighing. “An older brother came to visit.”

“Oh?”

Li Xizhi stood up, rolling down his sleeves. A hint of curiosity touched his face.

“If your brother came to visit, why leave him standing outside? You should have invited him in for a cup of tea.”

He raised an eyebrow. “An older brother… not Ruizao? I don’t believe you’ve mentioned another.”

Yang Xiao’er rarely spoke of the Yang family. Even regarding Yang Ruizao, the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from Azure Pond, she always seemed indifferent. News from the Yangs was rare, so Li Xizhi was quite interested.

But she looked a little awkward and shook her head. “He… I’m not very familiar with him. He was just passing by. We exchanged a few words, but he was in a hurry to attend to his duties and couldn't stay…”

Li Xizhi nodded, his eyes closing for a fraction of a second. He didn't press the matter. 

“What a pity,” he said with a smile.

He returned to the stone table and poured a cup of tea, asking casually, “Any news of the children?”

Yang Xiao’er smiled faintly. “Chenghuai is out gaining experience with my clansmen. My family has a deep foundation in the way of the Upper Shaman. However, that path must be paired with his Untraceable Presence, so it’s best he doesn’t draw attention to himself or seek fame. You needn't worry, husband.”

“As for Zhouluo…” She took the tea from her husband’s hand with a smile. “With your family’s young lord watching over him, he won’t suffer any disadvantages in Yue State! That brother of mine has secured many benefits for him, from Dao lineages and cultivation arts to spiritual items. Everything has been prepared.”

“That is quite a lot of trouble for your brother.” Li Xizhi raised an eyebrow, offering a gentle reminder, “But resources alone are not enough. Zhouluo’s innate talent is not high. The matter of his divine ability is still something to be considered carefully…”

It was sound advice, and Yang Xiao’er understood it well.

“Rest assured,” she said with a smile. “This opportunity was prepared specifically for him. With them watching, we can take it one day at a time… even if it takes fifty or a hundred years, they will wait until everything is perfect before he attempts to attain his divine ability.”

“Good!”

Li Xizhi’s expression was relaxed. He turned with a natural grace, his back to his wife, and hung the treasured sword within the hut. His grey-black eyes, their sharpness veiled, seemed to see through all worldly matters, brimming with tranquility.

“You’ve worked hard,” the man said softly.

Lotus Temple.

The temple was ablaze with lanterns, a scene of shimmering gold and jade. Hazy white mist cascaded like waterfalls down the steps and through the windows. In the great pool at the center, milky white liquid rippled, exuding a faint bloody smell.

A group of young, beautiful, bare-chested women knelt by the pool. Amidst the scent of oils and incense, they pressed their hands to their chests, adding their own contributions to the milk pool. A man lay within the churning liquid, completely naked, a wicked look on his face as he breathed out in leisurely fashion.

Suddenly, a robed monk appeared, cautiously kneeling at the foot of the steps. 

“My lord… my lord… someone from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm is here!”

The young man in the pool snapped his eyes open, his gaze filled with ice.

This was not good news. No wonder the monk was trembling, frozen to the steps, not daring to breathe.

But the youth had no mind to deal with him. He rose languidly from the pool. 

“Let him come up.”

The sound of footsteps echoed as a plainly dressed monk ascended the stairs. He stopped before the great pool, his brow furrowing at the debauched scene.

The youth merely lifted his eyelids, legs splashing casually in the pool, exposing himself brazenly. He sneered,

“So, it’s Maha Fachang…”

He smiled faintly. “It seems the dharma-realm is quite lenient. I heard you were thoroughly condemned on Mount Dayang, yet you’ve received no punishment at all. And you have the leisure to grace my humble abode.”

Fachang found the sight of the man’s appendage pointed directly at him extremely unsettling, but he possessed an excellent temperament and was foremost in the cultivation of the mind. He pressed his palms together—out of sight, out of mind.

“I have come to invite the Maha to head south!”

Hearing this, the youth’s face contorted in disbelief before he burst into loud laughter.

“Is this a joke? The great, merciful Maha Fachang, the Maha Fachang who occupies Jiangbei without stirring up the slightest conflict… is inviting me to go south! Are you no longer afraid of creating negative karma?”

Fachang kept his hands together, his expression serene, unmoved by the laughter. 

“I have heard that a new dynasty is poised to rise in the south and the riverbank is fraught with danger. Yet Peacock has left for his own selfish desires… News came from Mount Dayang, ordering my dharma-realm to find one or two Mahas to go and stand guard.”

“Among the Seven Aspects, Discipline is silent, Wrath has fallen into decline, and Evil Desire, Emptiness, and Compassion are all in collusion. Besides my dharma-realm, only the Way of Joyful Bliss… has less of a penchant for slaughter.”

“I have also heard that for the past hundred years, you have allowed the people to live in peace, rarely engaging in killing. Though you indulge in pleasure, there is goodness and beauty in your rule, and the people adore you. After much thought, I concluded that you were the most suitable choice…”

These words seemed to carry some hidden insult. The youth’s face flushed. With a great splash, he stood up from the milk pool.

“Bullshit! What I cultivate in this life is the Body of Vile Terror and Shameless Defiance! Who the hell are you calling… who are you calling indulgent! Who are you calling someone who rarely kills and is well-loved!”

He glanced around, his anger flaring. He stepped out of the pool, dripping milk everywhere, and kicked one of the Merciful Ones beside him. “You dog slave! Do you adore me?”

The Merciful One trembled in fear. It was true that Jinlian had killed less in recent years, but that was only towards the common people under his rule. The ranks of the Way of Joyful Bliss were packed to the brim, with legions of monks waiting for a position. He wouldn't care about the death of one or two Merciful Ones; he had certainly killed plenty of his own subordinates!

The man could only shake his head rapidly. Then he met the youth’s wicked eyes and, as if realizing something, began to nod. After two nods, he started shaking his head again, utterly lost. He dropped to his knees and began kowtowing frantically.

“Who the hell are you kowtowing to!”

Jinlian sent him flying with a kick, and the Merciful One’s head flew several meters away, rolling down the steps with a series of thuds. Still not satisfied, Jinlian fumed. Fachang, watching the man’s appendage sway with his every movement, finally could not bear it any longer.

“Fellow Daoist!” he sighed.

Jinlian lowered his leg. The headless Merciful One scrambled up, picked up a cloth, and began to wipe his master’s body. The expression on Jinlian’s face abruptly vanished, replaced by a cold mask.

“You people have really planned this well. You insist on dragging my Way of Joyful Bliss into this? It seems I have been cultivating for too long, and you have all forgotten what I am capable of… You dare ask me to go south? If I slaughter my way through Jiangbei until heads roll like stones, I wonder on whose shoulders that karma will fall!”

Fachang’s face was calm. “No matter who I ask, the karma will fall upon me… But I do not cultivate to avoid danger or seek advantage. By taking on this task, I can choose someone who will cause less slaughter. No matter how much karma I bear, if the people of Jiangbei can be spared, one less death is one less death. That is what truly matters.”

His words stopped Jinlian in his tracks. The youth stared at him, dumbfounded. 

“To think there is such a stubborn monk like you in this world! You’re determined to ruin your own Dao-Profundity!”

Fachang’s expression did not change. He said nothing. Just then, another monk ascended the steps. His body shone with a golden light, his skin as translucent as jade. He smiled brightly and bowed.

“Greetings, Master, and Senior Fachang!”

Fachang turned and glanced at him. “And who might this be?”

The monk looked up, a benevolent smile on his face. “This humble monk is Minghui! I have the honor of being my master’s attendant Maha… It is a pleasure to meet you!”
