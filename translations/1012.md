# Chapter 1012: The Soldiers Arrive

Li Suining’s heart sank, but he was wary of Li Jiangqian’s sharp, cold, and calculating nature. He dared not let his true feelings show, forcing a look of pleasant surprise. The white-robed swordsman beside them, however, let his own joy fade.

"How come we never heard?" he murmured. "To think it was enough to disturb Brother's seclusion."

Li Jiangqian folded his hands into his sleeves and gave a slight nod. "For a matter of this magnitude, of course."

Li Jiangchun understood at once. He stepped aside, gesturing for Li Suining to come forward. "Brother, this is Suining, a rare formation prodigy from my branch of the family. The Daoist Master met him personally and granted him a new cultivation method and Dao Lineage."

A faint smile touched the lips of the man in the crimson robe. "I have been in seclusion for so long. I had no idea the family had produced such a talent. It is a pleasure to finally meet you."

Joy still glimmering in his eyes, Li Suining responded with utmost respect, bowing formally. Then, feigning concern, he tentatively asked, "It’s just… a while ago, the Wilderness was consumed by karmic fire, and a battle between Purple Mansion Realm experts erupted over the lake. I wonder if this will affect the grand plan…"

Li Jiangqian waved a dismissive hand. "It is of no consequence. Just a couple of misguided Merciful Ones who threw their lives away in a futile struggle against the Daoist Master."

Hearing this, Li Suining immediately nodded in admiration. He hoped Li Jiangqian would elaborate, so he held his tongue.

He watched as Li Jiangqian narrowed his eyes. "The situation was urgent. The cultivators stationed on the lake were mobilized, leaving it undefended. The Daoist Master summoned me from seclusion merely to stand guard… As for the suddenness of it all… it wasn't entirely unexpected. Father has just returned from Simin."

The statement was veiled, a nuance Li Jiangchun naturally grasped. But Li Suining was no ordinary young man; he, too, understood its profound meaning.

'King Wei… so he went to Simin.'

The movements of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator were a closely guarded secret. At that time, he had only been at the Embyronic Breathing stage, so it was normal for him to be unaware. As he mulled it over, a golden light began to dawn on the horizon.

The light was as vast as a palace, yet long, narrow, and magnificent. Its upper decks were crowded with pavilions, manned by a dense formation of soldiers in white armor. It was a massive, pale-gold longship!

The great ship, Quhe!

This dharma vessel was the Li family's oldest flying ship, forged long ago by the Nine Gates of He from the western shore. Back then, the family's artifact-forging techniques were still crude, and the great ship could not change its size. But fortune and misfortune are two sides of the same coin. Since transforming it was not a consideration, subsequent modifications simply made it larger and larger. It usually rested at the bottom of the lake, its existence known to few.

Now, as it soared into the air, it resembled a high palatial platform gliding through the sky. A turbulent wave of air billowed in its wake as countless streaks of light, too numerous to count, swarmed around it like a protective cloud. The convoy ascended high into the heavens, and with a ripple of formation arrays, vanished from sight as it headed east.

'The Jade Court Guard has departed…'

Li Suining’s pupils reflected the dense, star-like shower of escaping light, and a flicker of pride ignited in his gaze.

'The Jade Court Guard… the precursor to the twenty-one divisions of Tingzhou and the royal soldiers of Zhao's King Wei. Now, they are about to strike for the first time. Let Wu and Yue hear the name of my family's Jade Court Guard…'

Li Suining could state without reservation that with the decline of the Zhao State's royal court, the number of powers in the world willing to spend a century building a proper military unit—to systematically supply a true orthodox army for a hundred years—could be counted on one hand. Even the great houses of the northern desert, hardened by constant warfare, were still plagued by the wildness of their tribal clans. When it came to unwavering discipline, none could compare to his family's Jade Court Guard!

This was a surprise attack led by their elite. Once King Wei established his kingdom, these elites could form the core of a new army. Only the soldiers of the northern kings of Dai and Bolie might compare, and even then, after a decade of bloodshed on the battlefield, it was likely that even the northern royal troops would have to give them a wide berth.

'Guest Retainer Ding is still alive. In the future, with the Palace-Yang Tiger and the Mystic Iron Thunder as vanguard generals and Third Uncle commanding the battle formations… hmph… even the state of Yan will have a headache.'

He watched the ship disappear over the horizon. From the lake's edge, two smaller, silver-white vessels rose into the air, following in its wake. They weren't nearly as large. These were acquired later from the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter; they could resize at will and were of high quality, but couldn't carry many people and served a supporting role.

Finally, as the last glimmers of light vanished, he averted his gaze and followed Li Jiangqian down into the inner array. A grand hall, shimmering beneath a violet-gold barrier, materialized before them.

Here, purple light swirled in a dazzling display of color. The ground beneath their feet was a solid, brownish-gold. Li Suining had spent much of his past life cultivating in this place, and a wave of familiarity washed over him.

'The architecture is more or less the same… most of it was already built by this time…'

The three of them landed in the highest hall, where they saw a man pacing anxiously before the entrance. He was dressed simply, with a kind and honest face. Upon seeing Li Jiangqian, he produced a letter from his sleeve.

He glanced around, noting that everyone present was permitted within the inner array. He offered a quick bow and spoke directly. "I bring a message from the Qunyi Archipelago!"

Li Jiangqian took the letter as An Siwei continued, his voice laced with unease.

"It's from Daoist Master Yuanbian… We've heard that the White Victory Dao has interfered in the affairs of Poluoduo. They pursued them all the way from the Western Sea to the Suopo Kingdom, gravely injuring the Great Suopo King, Demon King Fuxun, and nearly slaying Demon King Qingyan…"

"Fortunately, the Demon Kings of Poluoduo, each fearing for their own life, rose up in a chaotic uproar. A majority of them attacked together, forcing the cultivators of the White Victory Dao to retreat… But… it all happened so suddenly. Demon King Qingyan held on for several months, but his injuries are worsening. Demon King Fuxun wishes to invite Daoist Master Yuanbian to assist them!"

Li Jiangqian's expression shifted slightly. He took the letter and read it carefully, then slapped it into his palm and looked up with a cold smile.

"What convenient timing!"

This was clearly not good news. The Li family could afford to leave Deer Weeds Island in the archipelago unattended largely because of Daoist Master Yuanbian, who was stationed there year-round. While his departure wouldn't guarantee disaster for the island, its security would be drastically reduced.

Li Jiangqian’s face darkened. "What were Daoist Master Yuanbian's instructions, and how long ago did this happen?"

An Siwei looked somewhat embarrassed. "This letter was written immediately," he said respectfully. "It was first received by a patrol cultivator, who then reported it up the chain. I saw it midway and rushed back to the family at once. At that point, we had not yet located our own Daoist Master, so I haven't heard Daoist Master Yuanbian's decision… The Qunyi Archipelago is simply too far. Although the Daoist Master usually doesn't leave for long, the second letter must still be on its way…"

Li Jiangqian paced a few steps, lost in thought.

'Poluoduo… the White Victory Dao… This letter must have been sent before we made our move… What kind of scheme is this…'

He looked up. "What did our Daoist Master say?"

An Siwei quickly replied, "I have reported it. The Daoist Master… said the Qunyi Archipelago… is not urgent."

Li Jiangqian paced with his hands behind his back, understanding the unwavering resolve of the two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. There was a Purple Mansion Realm grand formation beneath the Qunyi Archipelago. As soon as Daoist Master Yuanbian left, Li Que'wan would certainly lead everyone to take shelter within it. Once the formation was sealed, as long as the people were safe, other losses were a secondary concern.

He waved An Siwei away. Several more cultivators entered the array to deliver reports, their low voices echoing through the great hall. Standing by, Li Suining felt a wave of clarity wash over him.

'The White Victory Dao interfered in Poluoduo, chasing them from the Western Sea to the Suopo Kingdom… If our Daoist Master had been in the West Sea, he would be trapped in this conflict right now!'

'In a battle of that scale, there was an eighty to ninety percent chance the Daoist Master was injured in my past life. That's why he didn't emerge for so long after returning to the lake… he was recuperating the entire time… which meant neither of our Daoist Masters could easily be deployed!'

That Emperor Song, Yang Zhuo, intended to march north. The forces of the Way of Great Desire had not yet withdrawn, and the north was watching like a hungry tiger. Moreover, he had heard that a certain Maha Taixi was currently guarding the Wilderness, and that old monster had always been an enemy of their family… How could he simply stand by and watch?

If they were delayed too long by the Purple Mansion Realm expert and the grand formation at Changxiao Gate, there was no telling what chaos might erupt over the lake. If the Daoist Master was seriously injured as he had been in the previous life, or if he hadn't even returned in time, the moment the Way of Great Desire made a move, the situation would have spiraled out of control.

'That's why… even when the perfect opportunity arose in my past life, King Wei could only keep his forces stationed at the lake, unable to act… But now, the Daoist Master is unharmed. He can deter Maha Taixi. And with the Master of Karmic Fire gone and the main forces of the Way of Great Desire not yet arrived, he can even hold off most of their strength with the help of the formation…'

After all, the Way of Great Desire was ultimately a step below Compassion in strength, and Maha Liangli was unable to head south. Compared to the overwhelming might Compassion had displayed when it acted, the current posturing of the Way of Great Desire was mere child's play.

He sorted through the timeline in his mind, his heart steadying. He realized the course of events was not bad at all.

'Changxiao Gate is a liability now. That Great Daoist Master of theirs will definitely not show himself. If we can swallow this leading power among the seven gates, the Foundation Establishment Realm and Qi Refining resources we gain will be an immense fortune…'

Standing to the side, Li Suining gazed at Li Jiangqian's tall, slender back. A sense of calm settled over him, and a feeling of security finally took root. He took a step back, a flicker of hope blooming in his chest.

### Helin Prefecture

The Helin Mountains were a famous range. Though not particularly dense with spiritual energy, they were vast and deep, with overlapping peaks and ridges. They stood beside a wide plain, facing the Quanwu Mountains to the east, and together they supplied the Yue State with the vast majority of its low-grade spiritual resources.

Between these two mountain ranges lay a vast plain, bordering the Mushroom Forest Plains to the north and Tongmo to the west. This endless fertile land was divided into two Prefectures: Helin and Cangwu.

Helin Prefecture was situated at the foot of the Helin Mountains. It was a place of long history, backed by a mountain forest with very few Demon beasts and located deep in the heartland, seldom troubled by conflict. The Prefecture's market district was enormous, built right next to the sect gates.

At this moment, the market was ablaze with lights. In its center stood a tall, magnificent platform covered in dense formation patterns. The uppermost pavilion was a work of art, from which loud, decadent music drifted in every direction. Courtesans moved between the banquet tables, pouring wine with ingratiating smiles.

Seated at the main table high above was a Daoist. He was fair-skinned with a wispy black mustache that gave him a shrewd look. He had his legs crossed and was shaking his head to the music, utterly at ease. His pale hand swayed gently with the rhythm, yet not a single drop of wine spilled from his cup.

After a while, a fawning laugh broke the air. An old man, holding a cup, approached the platform and knelt before the Daoist’s seat. He raised the cup over his head respectfully. "Lord Zhuang! This lowly one was able to keep his worthless life… all thanks to you, my lord… Please allow me to offer you a toast!"

The so-called Lord Zhuang above showed little expression. He glanced down his nose at the old man and said languidly, "Back then… when Situ Mo came to the Helin Mountains, he left you, you old coot, behind as a liaison. It was a good way to sell out the Situ family's overseas interests for his own gain… I never thought… it would end up saving your pathetic life."

The old man bowed hurriedly. "Indeed… indeed…" he said mournfully. "It's just a pity about what happened on the lake…"

The words made Lord Zhuang’s face change. He shot out a foot, kicking the old man viciously under the chin. The man flew into the air, flipped over, and crashed to the ground with a thud, coughing up blood.

'Damn it all, you might not value your life, but I value mine!'

Of course, he knew what the old man meant. In fact, that was precisely why he had saved him.

Changxiao Gate had been founded as an orthodox sect. The Dao Lineage of its founder, Changxiao, was pure, established upon True Qi, Purple Qi, and Cold Qi, supplemented by Lesser Yin and Lesser Yang. Its foundation was exceptionally sound. The Great Daoist Master's personal disciples even inherited a secret and powerful righteous path, the Encompassing Profoundity Dao.

And yet, for the past decade, the atmosphere in such an orthodox sect had grown increasingly strange. The Great Daoist Master Changxiao, the sect's founder, had been missing for years, leaving Daoist Master Cheng Yan in charge.

But the scandal surrounding Cheng Yan was so widely known that even outsiders had heard of it, let alone the members of Changxiao Gate themselves. In the years since Changxiao’s disappearance, the Daoist Master’s wife had gradually overstepped her bounds, and Cheng Yan’s doting indulgence knew no limits. The sect had lost its former purity from the very roots up.

The current sect master was Baibizi. This old cultivator had once participated in the siege against the White Qilin! When that same White Qilin later achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, he was half-envious and half-terrified, and he began promoting the Li family's enemies at every turn. The reason he, Daoist Zhuang, was able to return from overseas and take charge of such a large market was precisely because he had also been a participant that day!

Unlike Baibizi, after the initial few months of terror, Daoist Zhuang had gradually calmed down. He made inquiries and learned that Purple Mansion Realm experts had resolved their mortal karmic ties. Since he hadn't been killed on the day of the breakthrough, and with a Great Daoist Master backing his sect, he would likely be safe unless he personally provoked the other party.

So he had been biding his time in the market, a cold observer waiting for the day the lake erupted into chaos against the Buddhist cultivators. He gathered underlings who were at odds with the Li family—remnants of the Song family, old cultivators from the Situ clan—and sent them all to the sect.

'The sect is full of their enemies. It's better than me being their only enemy! If the Great Daoist Master ever decides to make a move, at least I'll have more accomplices!'

With Cheng Yan in seclusion, and with the daily efforts of these few, it was no wonder the atmosphere in Changxiao Gate had soured. Though they cultivated a brilliant and orthodox path, the sect was a far cry from the open-minded and nurturing environment it had been a century ago!

But what did he, Daoist Zhuang, care? Anyone who truly cared about Changxiao Gate was burned to death above Lake Xian by the White Qilin that day, their white cranes falling from the sky, their bodies left without a proper corpse!

He was smiling faintly to himself when he suddenly felt something. He looked down sharply and noticed the silver formation patterns beneath the main table begin to glow. He raised an eyebrow, propped his crossed feet up on the table, and leaned back lazily in his grand seat. "Which merchant caravan is flying so high again!" he said carelessly. "Fine them heavily!"

"Oh!"

A white-robed cultivator from the side hurried over. His face was flushed, clearly quite drunk, and his movements were clumsy. He activated his dharma power, affecting the grand formation. Holding a jug of wine, he apologized, "My apologies… my apologies! At this hour, it should be the shipment of Cypress Heart Fruit I'm responsible for… I'll open the formation myself for inspection. I apologize for disturbing you, my lords… Think of it as enjoying the scenery… I'll drink this cup in apology… no… three cups!"

With a red-faced, apologetic smile, he placed his hand on the formation disk. As his dharma power flowed into it, the magnificent, purple-and-azure eaves above them began to fade. Wisps of profound energy coalesced between the eaves, dissolving all obstructions and revealing the sky outside the hall.

The crowd in the pavilion raised their heads to admire the night view. Daoist Zhuang’s disdainful expression was still frozen on his face, but his pupils, now fixed on the sky, dilated in an instant. They reflected the colossal golden ship that spanned the night, its towering, multi-storied decks, and the endless streaks of light that filled the heavens.

The terrifying vista hung frozen in the night sky. Countless figures looked down upon them, their gazes cold or contemptuous, as if they had been waiting for a long time.

The banquet fell silent. So quiet one could hear a pin drop. Everyone's mind went blank. Yet, a single, grating laugh cut through the stillness.

"My mistake… my mistake… My apologies… Is it not enough that I apologize…"

The cultivator who had stepped forward was drunk. He didn't even look up, just kept drinking and muttering to himself. Finally, overcome by the wine, he collapsed backward onto his knees. The bronze jug in his hand clattered to the floor, splashing wine everywhere.

The stunned crowd continued to stare at the sky.

Streaks of immortal light swirled like a halo around the vessel. Cultivators clad in feathered robes or scaled armor shone with varied brilliance, like a heavenly army. Near and far, they flanked the colossal ship, their postures deferential. Every single gaze was fixed upon the pavilion on the main deck, frozen on the face of a young man leaning casually against a lustrous violet-gold railing.

A pair of cold, golden eyes.

Golden eyes with pupils like white-gold rings.
