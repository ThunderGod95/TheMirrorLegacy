# Chapter 1215: A Stalling Tactic

The direct heir of Mount Changhuai drifted away. Li Muyan lowered his gaze, his lips pressed into a thin line. After a moment of silence, he turned to Daoist Master Wu Gan and asked:

"Great Daoist Master... what do you make of this?"

Daoist Master Wu Gan merely unslung the long saber from his back, his expression somber.

'What do I make of it? What can I possibly make of it! Qing Jifang is an unreasonable, arrogant demon of a man. The method is useful, certainly... but... how many people will we offend!'

Both men knew full well that in the current world of martial cultivation, those in the Purple Mansion Realm certainly had no opportunity for a great slaughter; Foundation Establishment matters were left to Foundation Establishment cultivators to handle. The Sun and Chen families were mortal enemies and naturally wouldn't care about a little bloodshed, but once the butcher's knife was raised, the Tanshan Li Clan would be unable to escape.

'And from his perspective, the Tanshan Li Clan offending King Wei is only to be expected and not worthy of praise; it is the Bright Yang Li Clan that should be doing this sort of dirty work.'

Li Muyan understood this point perfectly well.

In terms of their circumstances, before the state of Shu was founded, the Tanshan Li Clan's situation could be described as flourishing. Yet, the moment Qing Jifang took charge, he had immediately and forcefully demanded his father be brought forth. He, Li Muyan, had humbled himself, acting as a loyal dog and horse, playing the fool time and again in the great desert, all to buy his father more time. He understood that his bloodline was a sharp sword hanging over his neck; only when his own clan's Daoist Master surpassed the Purple Mystery would Qing Jifang show an ounce of tolerance.

But now everything was clear: his father had failed, while the Sun Clan had succeeded. The Li Clan, which had once shown signs of contending for the top position among the nine great surnames, had now been utterly suppressed.

'These days of groveling and humiliation will be endless.'

Having reached this point, Li Muyan's regret had actually faded. The step his elder had taken was not wrong in itself. If Qing Jifang had even a shred of conscience, Li Muyan would not have to endure such humiliation, but Qing Jifang was just that arrogant!

Indeed, whether it was the Sun Clan or Li Muyan himself, after being tormented by this direct heir of the Qing Clan for so many years, the only thing they experienced from Qing Jifang was one word: arrogance.

'It's not that he lacks vision, nor that he is deliberately making things difficult for the Tanshan Li Clan. He simply doesn't care... he doesn't care what we think, nor does he care which Purple Mansion cultivator he offends. He torments whoever displeases him; all he wants is to vent his frustrations...'

And yet, there was no one who could restrain him. And Qing Jifang certainly had the capital for his arrogance—Mount Changhuai behind him was an existence that all the Purple Mansion cultivators combined could not shake in ten lifetimes. Who would dare to touch him?

Li Muyan fell into deep thought, but Daoist Master Wu Gan was also observing him, a hint of disappointment in his eyes.

'Another thunder cultivator... by resigning himself to his circumstances, his future on the Dao path is likely all but severed. Pitiful... truly pitiful. To think a descendant of King Jueyang would be so squandered.'

Daoist Master Wu Gan departed in silence. Li Muyan, not noticing much, stepped upon the Great Void and hurriedly flew off, a thousand calculations swirling in his mind, gradually converging into a surging tide.

'My Tanshan Clan is located in the heart of Shu; it can neither be moved nor taken away. Unless Shu is destroyed, it is impossible for us to serve a new master. The only possibility is for the Qing Clan to send a different heir to lead the army...'

'Daoist Master Guanlan is modest, kind, and exceptionally intelligent, and his surname is also Qing... it's just that he's several generations junior to him and has always been suppressed... If only something could happen to him. Wei Xuanyin, oh Wei Xuanyin... Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao... show me some real skill!'

'If worst comes to worst...'

Even a clay figure has a spark of anger. It was impossible for him, Li Muyan, not to harbor resentment after being ordered about by Qing Jifang in such a manner. His gaze swept indistinctly toward the northeast, his expression growing ever more forbearing.

'If I find an opportunity in the future to have Li Zhouwei beat him to death, we could all breathe a sigh of relief...'

...

"What a grand display."

Within the pavilion, a brilliant white light glowed. A great cauldron stood in the hall, and high above, a man in white robes sat in the master's seat with a smile on his face. Below, a woman with a beautiful face filled with worry waited for a while. Hearing no reply from the man above, she said:

"They are three Great Daoist Masters, after all. There has never been such a great commotion between the north and south... If Shu succeeds, I'm afraid Guanlong will be shaken... and a step further, it will reach the Chen State."

For several years, Wei Xuanyin's cultivation had not progressed in any particular way, but the Profound Governance Pavilion's withdrawal from the mortal world had clearly lifted a great burden from him. His entire bearing was clear and bright, as if containing infinite profound mysteries.

Yet he still had no choice but to remain here, seated in this small pavilion.

Hearing Yin Baiyue's words from below, Wei Xuanyin just shook his head silently.

"The Zhao court has already sent people three times, wanting me to come out of seclusion..."

The Great Daoist Master's eyebrow twitched.

"Pay them no mind."

Yin Baiyue nodded, listening as Wei Xuanyin spoke in a low voice:

"Qing Jifang is not an ambitious person. Even if he fights his way to the lands of Long, it is no cause for alarm. If the various Mahas and Liangli do not enter the fray, what use is there in anxiously begging my Profound Governance Pavilion?"

"Because of the masters' orders, I have to continue sitting in this position. But now the price has been paid in full, and the will of our Guanhua has been made clear, yet they are still eager to drag me into this..."

Yin Baiyue lowered her head slightly and fell silent. She hesitated for a long time before speaking softly:

"This junior... this junior doesn't understand. If that's the case, my Profound Governance Pavilion... why does our Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao remain here?"

Her eyes were filled with exhaustion, and even a trace of loathing.

"Senior Brother has also fallen now, and there are no great matters that require our attention. Why must our Dao lineage be dragged down in this imperial court..."

The woman's words left Wei Xuanyin speechless for a long time. The Great Daoist Master put down the jade slip in his hand and said softly:

"This matter... is already very difficult to explain."

A thoughtful look appeared in his eyes as he spoke softly:

"The Dao of 'Veiled Yin' was cast aside by Bright Yang. The distinction between higher and lower is obvious. In truth, when the predecessors cultivated the Dao, they all had their limitations, more or less. They weren't as steeped in demonic aura as Zong Chang, but there were still differences... Be it the 'Chamber of Doubt' or the 'Robe of Concealed Flaws', both rely on Profound Governance for their cultivation."

"In the beginning, the Profound Governance Pavilion was indeed something my Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao actively participated in for the sake of cultivation. But the affairs of this world, once the masters have placed them in your hands, cannot be discarded, whether you still need them or not."

A hint of coldness surfaced in his eyes as he said:

"And going forward... the northward advance of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is a sensitive matter. After all, Supreme Yang is of the Azure Profound Gonghua Daoist tradition, and that personage was the great figure who rebuilt the Green Pine Temple. No matter who takes charge, it carries the implication of a conflict between two profundities."

"After all, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition has no shortage of True Monarchs."

He paused, then said in a low tone:

"And my Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao is at least ranked among the three yins. Back then, to fulfill a promise made by a predecessor, we took on this matter and entered the Zhao State. The matter was pushed back and forth, and in the end, it still fell on my head, and unexpectedly spiraled out of control... ultimately pushing our Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao into the eye of this storm."

Yin Baiyue lowered her gaze, saying nothing. After a long while, she said:

"Since Martial Uncle says that the predecessors used Profound Governance to cultivate, this junior would like to know... by sitting in this position, can Martial Uncle truly cultivate?"

Wei Xuanyin's expression froze for a moment. He stared silently at the woman before him, but she knelt stubbornly, waiting for him to speak. Wei Xuanyin looked at her intently but did not reply.

Yet, even without hearing an answer, the truth was clearer than if he had spoken. A trace of sorrow flashed across Yin Baiyue's fair face as she said:

"Is it really so? Now that Senior Brother has fallen, why not hand over the affairs of Profound Governance to me? Martial Uncle can return to the Chen State... and cultivate properly, without bothering with the affairs of the world."

Wei Xuanyin remained silent.

Tears welled in Yin Baiyue's eyes as she said softly:

"Baiyue is, at any rate, a cultivator who has reached the Purple Mansion Realm. Though my divine abilities and Dao-Profundity are inferior to Martial Uncle's, I am not someone who cannot see the situation clearly. If it were truly for some responsibility undertaken by a predecessor, what need was there for Senior Brother to fight Bright Yang to the death, and fall at Lake Xian! Why does that group of people keep pressuring the Profound Governance Pavilion to enter the fray..."

The white-robed man above looked somber and said:

"Since you know this much, you understand what will happen if you take this seat."

"Nothing more than death!"

She choked up. Wei Xuanyin, however, simply put down the jade slip in his hand, finally revealing a trace of weariness as he said in a low voice:

"Baiyue, say no more..."

Yin Baiyue just lowered her gaze, grinding her teeth.

"It's just, it's just bullying our Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao for having no one! When the 【Unmoving Temple】 was established back then, who in the Dao did not praise our Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao for the favor! Now look, it has actually come to this, they say..."

"Baiyue!"

Wei Xuanyin's expression changed abruptly. He slammed the jade slip heavily on the table and said in a stern voice:

"Nonsense!"

Yin Baiyue slumped to the floor, turning her head away without a word.

The great hall fell silent in an instant. Wei Xuanyin broke out in a cold sweat. He shook his head in disappointment, but the woman said:

"There's nothing to hide. You can't hide it even if you try."

This sentence cut off Wei Xuanyin's warning. The Great Daoist Master shook his head, a headache coming on, but then he heard footsteps from within the hall. He raised his eyes abruptly and saw that a person was already standing in the vast hall.

This man appeared to be middle-aged, with sharp eyebrows and starry eyes, a broad face and thick shoulders, dressed in a Daoist robe of intermingled yellow and white. Just by standing there quietly, he exuded an immense pressure. Wei Xuanyin's expression was a mixture of shock and joy as he quickly said:

"Guanyi, you've come!"

This person was none other than a cultivator from Mount Luoxia, Yao Guanyi!

The middle-aged Daoist smiled faintly and strode forward, passing by Yin Baiyue like a gust of wind to sit at the side. Wei Xuanyin sighed inwardly and turned his head to say:

"Baiyue, you may leave first."

The woman rose, bowed to the two of them, and left without a word. The middle-aged Daoist, while pouring tea for himself, said quietly:

"It seems I've come at an inopportune time."

Wei Xuanyin shook his head helplessly and said:

"She is young and ignorant, I ask that you..."

The middle-aged Daoist filled his own cup, took a light sip, and said:

"If my junior martial niece continues to be so reckless with her words, she will implicate you in the end."

Wei Xuanyin sighed and replied:

"It was my negligence in teaching her."

The atmosphere in the great hall fell silent for a moment. The visitor could see that Wei Xuanyin's words were not entirely heartfelt. He put down his teacup and sighed softly.

"I am still looking for that thing for you. But I didn't come this time to bring you good news, but for the matter between the north and south."

His voice was deep and magnetic, his words concise:

"That fellow from the Qing Clan has already crossed the border and is getting serious. There are three Great Daoist Masters. With Jianghuai lost, both sides need someone to stand guard—Touba Qiye has already gone, and Zhu Kui can be counted as one."

"Isn't that enough?"

Wei Xuanyin looked up and said:

"One of them must always be on guard against the White Victory Dao."

The middle-aged Daoist said quietly:

"It's not enough. I hope you will act, preferably to repel the Shu army quickly."

Wei Xuanyin stared at him. The man shook his head with some helplessness and said:

"I hope Touba Qiye can remain in the east to guard against Jianghuai... Xuanlou, Gao Fu harbors the loyalty of an old retainer, and Great Yan is unruly. It is impossible for us to allow the Seven Aspects or the great clans to resist the Great Song alone... They are a disorganized mess, and most of them even harbor dissent. They will inevitably be crushed by the south!"

"As long as Touba Qiye stays in the east, I will have a reason to get you out of this... It's the lesser of two evils. Facing Western Shu is better than facing Bright Yang. Your cultivation did not come easily..."

Wei Xuanyin's expression gradually grew solemn. He looked at the Daoist before him and finally spoke:

"I don't understand. If you want me to achieve my goal, then give me a chance. If you don't, then just get rid of me sooner. Why torment me here? Although you say you are mediating... how can the transformation of a Dao-fruit be something so easily mediated!"

The man before him was stunned, appearing somewhat uneasy. After a moment of silence, he said softly:

"Xuanlou, I don't know."

Wei Xuanyin's expression became complicated. The Daoist shook his head, his tone somewhat cold as he said:

"This is not something I am privy to. Let alone me, I'm afraid even Senior Brother Xue cannot know. All I can do is delay it one day at a time... and wait for that turning point... Xuanlou."

"Is it really a turning point?"

Wei Xuanyin asked with an ambiguous tone.

In fact, with Qi Lanyan's fall and the loss of Jianghuai, there had been no news from the mountain about the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao for several years. The premonition in Wei Xuanyin's heart had grown increasingly clear.

'The excuse Lanyan bought with his life only served as a delay... There is more than one True Monarch who disapproves of me... Even... even when there is nothing left to say, they are still unwilling to concede.'

And now, even Yin Baiyue could see it. It wasn't someone else's scheme, but the great masters themselves who had personally instructed that he, Wei Xuanyin, be kept in this position, and they even intended to force him into action. Could this be for his own good? They truly did not want the 'Unblemished Robe' to be cultivated! Their rejection of the 'Veiled Yin' returning to the orthodox path ran much deeper than he had originally thought... They would not consent even if the True Monarch who achieved it was a figure of Comprehending Profoundity!

As a descendant of the Wei Clan of Chenchuan, the master of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao, Wei Xuanyin, who had carved a bloody path out of the dim and lightless Dao lineage of 'Veiled Yin'—his potential to achieve the orthodox 'Veiled Yin' had already exceeded the bounds of what these great masters could accept!

It was precisely for this reason that even though Wei Xuanyin was not inferior to the Wang Clan in bloodline, nor to Yao Guanyi in Dao-Profundity, and was even on par with the Xue Clan in his status within the Comprehending Profoundity orthodoxy, he was still placed in this extremely awkward position...

'They are just wearing me down, waiting until I can't hold on any longer, and then I'll follow their wishes and take a subordinate path... or even more simply, perish in body and Dao!'

Both men were geniuses of the highest caliber; how could Yao Guanyi not understand Wei Xuanyin's meaning! He closed his eyes tightly and remained silent for a long time. It was unknown how much time passed before he finally stood up and said:

"There will be a way..."

Wei Xuanyin began to pour tea with an inscrutable expression. Suddenly, the face of Kongshu appeared in his mind, and the monk's words echoed in his ears:

'How do we know King Wei doesn't harbor ambitions of imitating Emperor Wei? Even if he doesn't... could someone be forcing him to have them?!'

This thought brought clarity to his expression, and he said softly:

"I'm afraid that in the end, everything will be beyond our control."

Yao Guanyi turned and walked step by step down the stairs, saying faintly:

"I don't believe it."
