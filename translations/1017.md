# Chapter 1017: The Sima Family

Si Yuanli presented the jade bottle to Li Zhouwei. The golden-eyed young man peered inside, observing a clear, brownish-yellow vapor that churned and roiled as if struggling to break free.

Li Zhouwei had once obtained the Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise in Wanling Heaven, a text that detailed methods for refining treasured vases. It had stringent requirements for spiritual resources of the Upper Rite, so the material was not difficult for him to recognize. He raised an eyebrow.

“This is Radiant Spirit-Vessel. Though it’s called a spiritual resource, it isn’t exactly pure. It’s a refined essence created by blending several Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resources, and it must be stored in a vessel like this. It can sharpen the mind and maintain peak spiritual states, making it useful for practicing spell arts. There are two portions here… As for whether one can harvest its qi, that depends on their Daoist tradition.”

This was clearly not the answer Si Yuanli had been hoping for. His gaze fell, a flicker of disappointment replaced by a hint of suspicion.

‘He’s so familiar with this, yet just a moment ago he was asking me about the ways of the Upper Rite? He was probably testing me!’

He forced a smile and said aloud, “So, fellow Daoist, you also have some inheritance from an Upper Rite dao lineage. My shallow insights must have seemed like a joke to you.”

Li Zhouwei casually put the spiritual resource away, his eyes carefully scanning the cave-dwelling.

“Every family's dao lineage is different,” he said nonchalantly.

“I've only read a treatise or two, so I can recognize a few things. It can't compare to the comprehensive inheritance of a noble family like yours.”

He was speaking the truth, though whether Si Yuanli believed him was another matter. As they spoke, the sound of another formation shattering echoed, followed by a surge of roiling white mist. The space behind it was empty, save for flashes of crackling lightning. Si Yuanli had to raise a divine ability to dissolve the lingering restrictions.

“The Stormshatter Wedges are too violent for breaking formations,” he explained, a bit embarrassed.

“They’re fast, but they often leave behind residual restrictions that require extra work.”

The place was proving to be quite troublesome. Liu Changdie was unwilling to come to the mainland, making it difficult to find someone to handle this. Si Yuanli’s willingness to put in the effort saved Li Zhouwei considerable time. As Li Zhouwei took a seat to the side, Li Minggong strode in.

“Reporting to the Daoist Master,” she said in a low voice, “the Changxiao Gate has been secured. All the dao lineages have been gathered, their protections broken one by one, and moved into the cave-dwelling. The various spiritual items have been stored on the flying vessel. Everything is in order!”

The Li family’s efficiency was impressive, and with Wu Fan guiding them, Changxiao Gate’s resources were plundered in short order.

Li Zhouwei nodded. “Let Daoist Master Qinghu hear this as well.”

Li Minggong continued her report. “The Changxiao Gate possessed three Purple Mansion Realm dao lineages, all of them fourth-grade. They are the Vast Mountain on Earth Classic, which cultivates Wu Earth and leads to Immortal Without Flaw; the Responding Stone Glazed Light Classic, which cultivates True Qi and the ‘Stone-Embracing Slumber’ foundation; and the Cold Snow Lonely Peak Classic, which cultivates Cold Qi and the ‘Snow on the Pine’ foundation.”

“There are also two fourth-grade spell arts. The first is the Mountain-Offering Stone-Splitting Art, an offensive technique for Wu Earth. The second is the Cold Light Scenery-Proclaiming Formula, a Cold Qi spell art.”

She raised her hand, five golden jade slips resting in her palm. “The remaining dozen or so texts are still sealed. We are interrogating prisoners for the method to open them, but according to our cultivators’ observations, none of them appear to be Purple Mansion Realm grade. I fear the harvest from them will be meager.”

Si Yuanli listened with a sense of wonder. A fourth-grade spell art would be a prize for the direct lineage of an ordinary Purple Mansion Realm family. But for the Li family, cultivation methods and spell arts were hardly rare. Li Zhouwei was visibly disappointed.

“It seems we won’t find any Upper Rite Daoist traditions among these peaks,” he said with a frown. “Changxiao had fifth-grade, perhaps even sixth-grade Dharma Arts, but he clearly never passed them down to his disciples. No wonder Changxiao Gate had such a grand reputation but so few astonishing talents… There was only Wang Fu… and the path he cultivated was a dead end.”

Si Yuanli arched an eyebrow and smiled. “How could they compare to the closeness of a noble family? A so-called sect is a messy affair of tangled relations and crafty associates. Even a master with the best intentions has to hold something back to keep his disciples respectful, to say nothing of a cruel and cunning man like Changxiao.”

“There will always be flaws. The problem lies with people, that’s all.”

Li Zhouwei shook his head. Li Minggong waited for their conversation to pause before speaking again.

“Si Xunhui has arrived on the mountain with his men.”

This mountain was to be handed over to the Sima Family; the delay had been an intentional gesture to give the Li family time to collect the spoils. Li Zhouwei immediately looked at Li Minggong.

“Bind all of Cheng Yan’s relatives, associates, and disciples. Let him watch as they are dealt with.”

With a formidable enemy looming in the north, the Li family could not linger. His words were a clear signal to transfer control of the mountain. Li Minggong nodded and withdrew. Si Yuanli smiled faintly as another crash echoed through the air. This time, it seemed a critical point had been breached. The already fragile inner formation began to tremble violently, threatening to collapse at any moment.

Si Yuanli quickly retrieved an item from his robes. It was a palm-sized piece of greenish-blue spirit wood. He pressed it into the formation, and the violent shaking instantly ceased. With a delicate flick of his finger, the contents within flowed out like water and arranged themselves neatly on the table.

Silver and white objects lay scattered, their profound patterns shimmering: one scroll, one jade slip, one jade box, two talismans, and four jade bottles.

Only then did Li Zhouwei nod in satisfaction. “Thank you for your trouble, fellow Daoist!” he said with a smile.

“It was no trouble at all!” Si Yuanli replied, but he seemed to want to say more, ultimately just shaking his head with a smile. Li Zhouwei paid him no mind, his gaze sweeping over the scroll.

The scroll was silver-white, its texture and form vastly different from the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll he had seen before, clearly an ancient artifact. He gave it a light shake, and it unrolled to reveal six large, silver characters:

Tome of Subjugating the Murky Mountain

A quick scan told Li Zhouwei it was a Wu Earth technique and the source of Cheng Yan’s Art-Suppressing, Light-Quelling Wu Brilliance. That brilliant light had been exceptionally powerful, likely fifth-grade, so its origins were indeed extraordinary.

‘Cheng Yan didn't have this on him, so I don't have to split it with Si Yuanli...’

The jade slip, of course, could not be opened, which was a persistent headache. The two talismans were the same Form-Dissolving Mind-Shift Talismans Cheng Yan had used before. Of the four pills in the bottles, only one Nangong Xuan-Sui Pill was noteworthy; the other three were Wu Earth pills and would be difficult to sell.

The jade box contained a piece of Bound Heart-Ice, a spiritual resource of the Cold Qi path. It wasn't priceless, but it was exceedingly rare and could be used to quell inner demons and dispel fire poison. If submerged in a spring, it could produce Unfallen Rain Cold Water, a Foundation Establishment Realm resource. It was arguably the most valuable item among the lot.

He collected everything, making a quick assessment.

‘It really was picked clean, but at least Cheng Yan wasn't completely destitute…’

Beside him, Si Yuanli looked utterly dejected. “Cheng Yan used a treasure called the Yongjing Profound Ring… it wasn't on him during the fight, and I had hoped it might be in his treasury. In the end, it seems Changxiao took it. There was also a Heart-Cultivating Celestial Instrument Stone, a treasure that can be used to refine a second body. That’s missing as well…”

Now Li Zhouwei understood what he had been searching for. He chuckled and shook his head, his gaze falling upon the piece of green wood holding the inner formation stable. “And this is…?”

The mountain was being given to Si Yuanli, but Li Zhouwei had not been generous enough to include the Purple Mansion Realm grand formation. He wouldn’t give him the chance to tamper with it. The question was direct.

“The core of this Purple Mansion grand formation is hidden deep within,” Si Yuanli explained, shaking his head. “Without the owner’s command token, we can’t touch it. I shattered the inner arrays and used this Displacing Mulberry Wood to deceive the formation core. Otherwise, the entire system would have destabilized.”

Li Zhouwei smiled faintly. “It seems this formation won’t be so easy to acquire.”

This Purple Mansion grand formation was valuable, even better than the one over their own lake. Yet, the Li family had no intention of using it. For one, they simply lacked the energy to go through such a massive undertaking again. Secondly… this was Changxiao’s grand formation. Who would dare to use it without worry? Without a complete and total overhaul, no one would feel safe cultivating within it. And after such a modification, who knew how much of its power would remain?

‘If our family’s grand formation by the lake ever needs replacing… we would build a new one ourselves, dismantle the old one, and then move this one over… what difference would it make?’

Si Yuanli had reached the same conclusion. Although Upper Rite didn’t conflict with Upright Wood, his family was wealthy. Rather than waste materials on risky modifications, it was far more reassuring and comfortable to build his own. Hearing Li Zhouwei’s words, he grasped the implication immediately.

“I will dismantle it for you, fellow Daoist!”

A Purple Mansion grand formation required immense resources and effort to create. Even with the formation core from Profound Peak, the Li family had spent a fortune in spiritual materials back then. Li Zhouwei nodded and stepped outside with him.

“I will leave some men here,” he said softly. “You may command them as you see fit. However, the formation core is precious. Once the disassembly is complete, I must trouble you to deliver it to us!”

Si Yuanli would be using this mountain gate himself, so he didn’t mind the extra work. He nodded with a smile. For once, Li Zhouwei returned his smile warmly before his gaze shifted.

“Now that you have a mountain gate to call your own, the Sima Family’s prospects will surely change.”

Si Yuanli began forming a Dharma Art, seemingly adjusting the outer formation. Streams of white mist flowed past, but the sky above remained clear. Unconcerned, he continued manipulating the spell art.

“Back on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, I asked fellow Daoist Zhaojing about a mountain gate,” he said in a low voice. “It was merely a preliminary step. I was waiting for the dust to settle before approaching you and the Chen Clan.”

“I had assumed the Li Clan would remain protective of its territory by the lake and wouldn’t take the lead in external affairs… I never imagined Your Highness would be so decisive. Crossing the Mushroom Forest Plains overnight to slay Cheng Yan… it must have caused an uproar in Wu and Yue.”

While capturing the Changxiao Gate was cause for celebration, and Si Yuanli was genuinely pleased, he also had many regrets. The affair had been too sudden for the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. It wasn't just Cheng Yan who was caught off guard; Si Yuanli was as well.

Changxiao Gate was always going to be made an example of. According to Si Yuanli’s plan, once the larger situation had stabilized, the Sima Family would have taken the lead, uniting the Chen and Li clans to annihilate Changxiao.

In that scenario, it would have been Si Yuanli who conquered Changxiao. The mountain gate would have been his by right. If the Purple Mansion grand formation could be preserved, even better. The remaining spiritual treasures would have been generously divided between the other two families, fostering goodwill.

Although the outcome was the same, the one who took the lead was different, which put Si Yuanli in an awkward position. The Li Clan had indeed promised him the mountain gate, but they would never give him a magnificent Purple Mansion grand formation for free!

Therefore, when the Li family had urgently sought him out, Si Yuanli had been utterly shocked. Who could have predicted such an aggressive move? After the initial shock came hesitation, and in that moment, he understood the stakes. No matter what schemes he might devise, with the two families now appearing as close as fire, how could he possibly refuse? And even if he had refused, would that have stopped Li Zhouwei? At worst, Cheng Yan might have escaped. Once Changxiao Gate fell, Si Yuanli would have been left with nothing—not the mountain gate, not a single benefit.

And if he had somehow acquired the mountain gate later, with Cheng Yan having escaped, what would he do with all the disciples left behind? Kill them or spare them?

Sometimes, a shift in circumstance, a simple matter of who acts first, determines who is the host and who is the guest. That single difference had cost him a Purple Mansion grand formation—enough to keep an ordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator busy for decades. Even for someone as ridiculously wealthy as Si Yuanli, the loss was a painful sting.

Yet his thoughts ran deep, and his demeanor had remained perfectly natural from start to finish. He had only requested an even split of Changxiao’s wealth. But the regret in his heart compelled him to ask these questions.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him, his expression noncommittal. He answered candidly, “The Li Clan seeks vengeance, and so do I. The Li Clan seeks self-preservation, but I seek the Dao. He was right about one thing: if not my family, it would have been another. It was just his misfortune that it was me.”

Si Yuanli fell silent, pondering the weight of Li Zhouwei’s words and how the Sima Family should position itself in the future. After a long moment, he looked up.

‘The great tree that is the White Qilin has grown strong enough to offer shelter. Though it may fall one day, for now, it stands firm.’

That was a problem for the Li Clan to worry about. Si Yuanli would not concern himself with it. He would simply take one step at a time, looking ever upward.

The faint, dripping sound of blood reached his ears. Si Yuanli put a hand to his waist, untied his green outer robe, and draped it over his arm. The golden tassels dangled, revealing the snow-white inner shirt beneath.

“My house should be established as a clan.”

Daoist Master Qinghu, Sima Yuanli, let out a breath from deep within his chest, his expression undergoing a distinct transformation.

Li Zhouwei gave him a second look, his gaze drifting absently toward the ground beneath his feet. “On my way here, I noticed that the rice in Helin Prefecture is half-ripe,” he said softly. “The disturbance to the earth veins has altered the soil’s fertility. The harvests for the next few years will be uncertain. I cannot interfere in the prefecture’s affairs, but this matter is ultimately my responsibility. My family will deliver grain; I must trouble your clan to see to its distribution.”

The golden-eyed young man lowered his gaze, the murderous aura that had clung to his brow dissipating.

“When Changxiao was here, they never went hungry. Now that I am leaving, I cannot leave them to famine.”

The tone of the conversation was no longer that of the Azure Pond Immortal Sect; it was a dialogue between two Immortal Clans. Sima Yuanli, a man of exceptional perception, raised an eyebrow.

‘A warning… or a reminder?’

But his face was all smiles as he replied earnestly, “We will handle this matter perfectly, down to the last detail!”

The two Daoist Masters stood in the light. Sima Xunhui had already led his men up the mountain. He was a handsome man to begin with, and clad in spiritual armor, he cut a truly imposing figure. Behind him was the triumphant Wu Fan. They bowed together to Sima Yuanli and Li Zhouwei.

“To the two Daoist Masters,” Sima Xunhui declared respectfully, “the divine ability has fallen! The peak lords have answered the call of radiance and joined together to eradicate the evil Dao! All have performed meritoriously. The mountain gate is now peaceful and compliant, a picture of clarity and order!”

“Excellent!” Sima Yuanli stroked his beard, his eyes slightly red. He closed them, trembling faintly.

Below the steps, the young man’s eyebrow twitched. He announced in a clear voice, “This junior congratulates the Daoist Master!”

The golden threshold of the cave-dwelling shone brilliantly, made even brighter by the divine abilities of the two men. In the mountain forest, blood dripped from the leaves, spreading into small, dark red pools on the ground.

Several pale white, cloud-patterned Daoist robes lay discarded in the woods, hastily shed by their former owners. They were twisted into mangled heaps in the bloody mire, stained and mottled. A jade crown lay upturned beside them, filled to the brim with blood.

Throughout the mountain, cultivators knelt in the spreading pools of gore. Wu Fan’s deferential voice rang out, echoing across the peaks.

“This subordinate congratulates the Daoist Master!”
