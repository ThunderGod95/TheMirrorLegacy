# Chapter 1043: The Order of Yin and Yang

The sky was bleak, and a gray wind churned the air. A purple-black jade pearl ascended into the heavens, casting a cascading torrent of light down upon the Purple Light Blessed Land. A colossal, ferocious ghost hung suspended in the sky, pulling a massive chariot behind it.

Before the carriage stood a man in black robes, his expression as cold as ice. The Martial Cultivation Star shone down from above, its radiance draping him in a celestial mantle of True Qi, making him appear like a god descended to the mortal realm.

A tapestry of divine abilities crisscrossed the sky. The woman in flowing robes withdrew her Spiritual Artifact, a faint blush returning to her pale cheeks as she glanced toward the Daoist Master on the other side.

'It… it should be time to stop, shouldn't it?'

Nearby, a young Daoist Master stood in serene silence. He was draped in a long, white, luminous gauze over Daoist robes patterned with black clouds on a white, gold-trimmed background. With rosy lips and a fair complexion, he simply watched Yang Ruiyi in the sky, his expression unreadable.

He kept one hand tucked inside his sleeve, patting it gently.

'Come back,' he thought. 'The matter of Moongaze Lake can wait for another day.'

Beside him, Kong Tingyun remained oblivious to the undercurrents. Her eyes darted between Helian Wujiang and Murong Yan, who flanked her, their killing intent churning like a tide. She noted that these two outsiders were also silent, quietly waiting to see how the situation would unfold. Only the enormous golden Dharma Body in the sky continued to unleash a thousand-eyed radiance, holding back the surging black clouds.

'Wielding the light of Martial Cultivation, Yang Ruiyi is practically the equal of a Great Daoist Master with four divine abilities here on Song court soil… A Great Daoist Master from a relict clan of the Underworld is likely beyond our ability to defeat.'

The great battle had left devastation in its wake. Kong Tingyun didn't even need to look to know that the Profound Peak Gate, which had only just begun to recover, had surely suffered grievous losses. Yet she had no say in the matter, nor was there any possibility of avoiding this conflict.

'If the Song court wants to rule from across the river, they will never let the Profound Peak Gate go. And if the Profound Governance Pavilion wants to legitimately suppress the southern powers, they will absolutely never let me go…'

Kong Tingyun knew that her own Daoist Master Changxi had done his best, but frankly, the situation had only grown worse under her watch. A self-deprecating thought surfaced in her mind.

'Right now, I may be walking on a mountain of blades, but at least there is a path. The day the north and south finally stop fighting, when the Profound Governance Pavilion's forces return to Jizhong and no longer pay any mind to Jiangbei… that is the day I will truly have something to fear!'

She waited for what felt like an eternity before Qi Lanyan, standing beside her, finally spoke with a beaming smile.

"Judge Yang’s methods are truly impressive, living up to his reputation. To be able to command the Martial Cultivation Star so soon after establishing a state—we are indebted to you for making this trip, Lord Yang."

Poised atop the ghost chariot, Yang Ruiyi’s gaze was laced with contempt. He let out a cold laugh.

"Wei Xuanyin is the anointed lord of the Profound Governance. If he were here, he might have the right to speak such words. But you? Your Qi family are nothing but two-faced vassals of the Yan and Zhao. You, Qi Lanyan, are just some minor cultivator from Yan Mountain. If you hadn't latched onto the Profound Governance, you’d be just another Gongsun Bei. What qualifications do you have to comment on the methods of the great figures of my Underworld?"

He continued in a flat tone, "The Lord of Luoxia may be ascendant in matters of the Immortal Dao for now, but don’t forget whose family head just died. To speak so recklessly of the departed… are you determined to leave your family no path of retreat?"

The rebuke was perfectly timed, the threat precisely delivered. The smile on Qi Lanyan's face slowly faded, his fury simmering beneath a surface he could not break. He clenched his jaw and said nothing more. Watching this, Murong Yan felt a chill creep into his heart. He slowly adjusted the grip on his staff and sighed internally.

'This Yang Ruiyi is no easy mark. The Underworld has always maintained an aloof detachment. When have they ever resorted to such open threats? He’s left that fellow Qi with no way to save face…'

The fleshy cheeks of the Murong direct-line heir trembled as his eyes narrowed to slits.

'Perhaps the Yang family's status has risen considerably because of this True Qi matter…'

Qi Lanyan offered no further words. With a flick of his sleeve, he departed, and the contingent of northern cultivators retreated with him. Yang Ruiyi remained standing on the ghost chariot. Immediately, a sword cultivator rode the winds to the carriage, bowed, and said,

"Thank you for your aid, my lord!"

Yang Ruiyi glanced at him, his form already vanishing, leaving only a faint echo of his voice.

"Qi Lanyan still wants to drag this out. The real problem is in Ting Province. Daoist Master, guard this place. I am going to reinforce King Wei at once."

Nearby, Ning Wan descended hastily on the wind, her face a little pale. She nodded at his words, breathing a silent sigh of relief. Yang Ruiyi, meanwhile, stepped into the Great Void. The menacing ghost chariot swept forward, and in an instant, the vista before him transformed into the blood-soaked surface of a great river.

The entire riverbank was a sea of crimson. Under the setting sun, the sand and gravel gleamed with a dark, crystalline red. Skeletons and shattered swords carpeted the shore. Several mountain peaks had collapsed, revealing the blackish-brown rock beneath.

The massive, intricately-patterned wreckage of a golden Dharma Body lay fallen on the bank like a range of rolling hills, its lifeless eyes staring blankly at the sky.

Directly in front of where the golden figure had knelt, a Celestial Gate that seemed to span the heavens stood upon the earth. Its pure, crystalline radiance no longer shimmered; instead, it was spattered with blood and pockmarked with craters. Amidst the carnage of the battlefield, it resembled an ancient city watchtower, projecting an even greater sense of majesty.

'Ting Province has suffered greatly.'

If the battle in the Shanji was a strategic game between the northern and southern immortal aristocracies, a clash that ended once a point was made, then the slaughter on the northern bank was a true, no-holds-barred fight to the death, where blood flowed for a thousand miles. The menacing ghost chariot, hanging in the twilight sky, seemed perversely at home in this scene.

Yang Ruiyi sighed inwardly and descended.

A young man stood leaning on a halberd held in one hand. The qilin patterns on his black-and-gold armor had dimmed, the surface scarred with countless silvery-white slash marks. The Campaign Cloak at his back was riddled with tears, fluttering gently in the wind.

Li Zhouwei looked up. His golden eyes were as sharp as ever, but a massive scar ran from his forehead, down the bridge of his nose, and all the way to his chin, revealing bone through which a multicolored light flowed. The Dawn Qi at the wound's edge was being rapidly expelled from his body, the flesh slowly knitting itself back together.

By the time Yang Ruiyi descended with his divine ability, King Wei was in the process of unstrapping a vambrace covered in silvery slash marks, revealing a skeletal arm of pure white bone—one he had clearly just reattached.

Yang Ruiyi, who had been so imperious before the northern cultivators, now found himself at an awkward loss for words. Fortunately, Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"My thanks, Lord Yang."

Yang Ruiyi looked at him intently, then shook his head.

"What happened in Ting Province was a miscalculation on the part of my Song court…"

The imperial general unfastened his own cloak and draped it over the young man’s shoulders. The pieces of azure light on the cloak immediately brightened, shedding the brilliance of Horn Wood. Yang Ruiyi then produced a jade box from his sleeve and said in a low, serious voice,

"You are too gravely injured… Take this first!"

Li Zhouwei reached out and took it. Just by its weight, he knew what was inside.

'Golden Branch of the Late Tassel… a nigh-extinct resource of Horn Wood…'

The Golden Branch of the Late Tassel was a treasure of Horn Wood. Though classified as a resource, its rarity was comparable to a spiritual item. It was best consumed whole and was a miraculous item capable of reviving the dead and regenerating flesh. Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and replied,

"Thank you for your concern, my lord, but I have already taken medicine."

The Dawn Qi Spiritual Treasure in Gongsun Bei’s hands had been truly formidable. Under the suppression of its spirit platform, Li Zhouwei’s divine abilities had been greatly diminished, and his dharma power consumption had multiplied. The two short halberds that accompanied the platform were especially insidious, capable of piercing his Bright Yang divine abilities and moving with blinding speed.

Even with his Immortal Mirror to scout for them, he had been facing both Mingxiang and Gongsun Bei. He was often aware of the weapon but lacked the spare capacity to react. Not only was the artifact immensely powerful, but a single strike would unleash a torrent of Dawnlight that spread through the body like venomous snakes.

Fortunately, his Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body could dissolve the Dawnlight. Li Zhouwei had used it to suppress the affliction with a massive amount of dharma power… but that made it even harder to fend off the siege, trapping him in a vicious cycle. If not for the Talisman Qi, Illuminating Sun and Moon, sensing his fate and providing a ceaseless supply of dharma power, he would have fallen long ago.

'My own reserves of dharma power and divine abilities are already beyond the norm, and I only survived by the skin of my teeth with the aid of Illuminating Sun and Moon. If any other mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Bright Yang cultivator had been suppressed here, they would already be dead, with no hope of escape!'

Even though Li Zhouwei had endured, his body was now a chaotic mess. The Dawnlight poison flowed through every inch of his physical form, and he could only suppress it through sheer force of dharma power, preventing him from sparing any effort to heal his wounds.

The damage Dawn Qi inflicted on a Bright Yang foundation was terrifying. Li Zhouwei's injuries were severe, the kind that truly harmed his core, yet he was not anxious.

The reason was simple. With the retreat of the enemy cultivators, the wonder of Sovereign's Perilous Tread was reawakening at a slow but steady pace.

It was the effect of having successfully tread through peril!

'It would have been one thing in a one-on-one duel. But being besieged by a host of cultivators has pushed my White Qilin's Destiny to its absolute limit, ninety percent to completion, and has also triggered my Sovereign's Perilous Tread… a truly wondrous confluence!'

The awakening of Sovereign's Perilous Tread was also providing feedback with an additional ninety percent effectiveness. But even more important was the Talisman Qi, Illuminating Sun and Moon!

With his life-mandate bound to one of his inner mansions, the seemingly fatal injuries were first greatly mitigated. Then, in response to the battle trigger 'Break Divine Abilities, Defeat Demons and Buddhists,' which resonated with his White Qilin's Destiny, his Shengyang Acupoint began to surge with an endless tide of dharma power.

Right now, his Shengyang Mansion was roiling with dharma power, his divine abilities brilliant and full. He had merely sealed it away. While the Dawn Qi poison was anathema to Bright Yang, as long as the critical issue of dharma power was resolved, and with the pills he had on hand, recovery would not be difficult.

However, these miraculous effects were either sealed or suppressed by him, making them unnoticeable. They were also the result of his White Qilin's Destiny, which was outside the normal scope of Sovereign's Perilous Tread. Yang Ruiyi was clearly unaware of any of this, which left him feeling both embarrassed and vexed.

'We just enfeoffed him as King Wei, and the moment he steps out the door, he gets grievously wounded defending his lands, injuring his very foundation… This is nothing short of throwing my Yang family’s face on the ground and stomping on it!'

'And this will be even harder to explain to my little sister…'

His gaze turned grim.

'Qi Lanyan… Wei Xuanyin… I would have thought that the Profound Governance Pavilion, being a subordinate of Luoxia, would refrain from being the first to agitate against Bright Yang, even if the world has turned against it… Their methods are utterly shameless!'

Now that Yang Zhuo was the Song Emperor, there were many things Yang Ruiyi could not control and could only pretend not to see. But Qi Lanyan's actions had undoubtedly earned his deep dissatisfaction. He narrowed his eyes.

'Just you wait.'

Fortunately, Li Zhouwei did not let the awkwardness linger. He casually dismissed his divine ability and raised a hand to wipe his face. All his injuries and abnormalities vanished, and he once again looked every bit the majestic and imposing figure.

"Please."

**The Great Zhao.**

The light of the bright moon cast a silvery sheen across the sea. A man in white stood with his hands behind his back on a dark sea cliff, saying nothing.

After a moment, a spectral phantom drifted through the mountains, flickering in the ravines before solidifying into the form of a woman. She was dressed in men's clothing and clutched a wine jug. She knelt softly among the rocks, and a swarm of insects and snakes spilled out from under her robes, creating a chorus of faint rustling.

A low chuckle escaped her throat.

"What fine spirits you are in, Grand Preceptor, enjoying the moon all by yourself."

Wei Xuanyin turned his head and looked down at her.

"What business does Attendant Zong have with me?" he asked coolly.

This woman was none other than Zong Chang.

Both were famous figures with unique statuses. One was the Grand Preceptor of the Great Zhao, who practiced Veiled Yin through the orthodox Immortal Dao. The other was a power-mongering court attendant who cultivated Veiled Yin through heretical, unorthodox methods. One high, one low, yet they maintained a strangely amicable relationship.

Zong Chang squinted, took a drink of wine, and said languidly, "I just received word of a great battle between the north and south. I hear many people died on the riverbank… With such a wonderful event, my lord received news and didn't even think to share a piece of it with me? If I had been there, things would only have gone better, not worse…"

Wei Xuanyin sighed and shook his head. He recognized the sarcasm in her words but didn't respond. Zong Chang then asked abruptly,

"Was Qi Lanyan acting on your orders? To so deliberately target Bright Yang… taking the lead for all the great families. He is quite bold."

Wei Xuanyin replied impassively,

"I do not know whose handiwork that was. You are mistaken, fellow Daoist."

Though they both practiced Veiled Yin, they walked completely different paths. Wei Xuanyin felt no particular animosity toward her, but Zong Chang harbored a deep jealousy for him. Her eyes shifted as she replied,

"You and I both cultivate Veiled Yin. On this matter, our interests should align. Why must you deceive me?"

Wei Xuanyin watched her in silence for a long moment before speaking.

"The path of the Wei-Li is glorious, and the Imperial Monarch is worthy of admiration. But he greatly elevated the Human Dao, which runs contrary to the Immortal Dao. Since his time, the balance between Veiled Yin and Bright Yang has shifted. You say our interests align, but I do not believe that is entirely true."

Standing under the moonlight, the man's features appeared androgynous.

"I intend to uphold the orthodoxy of Veiled Yin, to achieve the merit of restoring the harmony of yin and yang, and to rebuild the Daoist work destroyed by Li Qianyuan… If I were to ascend by destroying Bright Yang, I would inevitably be transformed by a hundred evils and walk a demonic path. That is not my intention. You need not ask again."

Zong Chang laughed coldly.

"What grand ambitions you have. You think you can attain the Fruition of Veiled Yin on your own power? To achieve it through righteous and honorable means, without stooping to the station born of yin and yang reversed, of order overthrown? For that, you would need the ability!"

She smiled.

"The world awaits the descent of Bright Yang. Whether the White Qilin succeeds or fails, the great masters above are not overly concerned and have tacitly permitted their wagers. But the various Dharma Masters, the great clans, and the immortal sects all have their own stances. Since those on high have not given a command, it is every man for himself."

"I don't care about your orthodoxy or whether you have the ability. I ask you this: if Li Zhouwei masters all his divine abilities, strives for Fruition Attainment, and replaces the Bright Yang Imperial Monarch, heralding the revival of Bright Yang… it is hard to say whether the great masters could tolerate it… but could you, Wei Xuanyin, tolerate it?!"

"If the great revival of Bright Yang truly comes to pass, with Bright Yang ascendant and Veiled Yin in disarray, things will inevitably return to how they were in the Wei State of old. Veiled Yin will be debased, becoming the very demonic path you speak of. And your True Spirit, Wei Xuanyin, resides in a man's body. Do you think Li Zhouwei would spare you? What talk is there of yin-yang harmony? What possibility of a breakthrough? It would be suicide! Do I really need to remind you of this?"

The woman remained kneeling on the ground, drinking by herself as she smiled.

"If those on high were managing things, it would be a different story. But they clearly are not. And you are an ambitious man who seeks that station. Could you truly allow someone so unstable, someone who could destroy your every chance of ascension, to continue on his path?"

"And now… now Qi Lanyan has been scheming and probing, showing his intent to destroy Bright Yang. He is acting on your behalf, risking his very life to do so. You, Wei Xuanyin, hold a high position in the Profound Governance, and your Dao-Profundity is terrifyingly deep. If you tell me you knew nothing of this, I refuse to believe it!"
