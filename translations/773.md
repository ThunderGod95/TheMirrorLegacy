# Chapter 773: The White Crane Falls

'That cyan-white sword at his waist must be the legendary Qingchi.'

Baibin Zi watched the man fighting within the spiritual light of the Yongjing Profound Ring, and a deep sigh escaped him.

Li Chejing had not been a member of the Sword Gate, nor had he reached the Purple Mansion Realm. After a hundred years, the Sword Immortal's connection to them had faded. For all these years, there had been no news of interaction between the Sword Gate and the Li family. The Sword Gate's feelings for that short-lived Sword Immortal were likely more regret than any deep bond.

But Baibin Zi remembered, back when he was only an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator assigned to guard the Changxiao Gate's assets in the Chengshui Mausoleum Market, he had heard of another man: that Sword Immortal's elder brother, Li Tongya.

And that man, Li Tongya of the Celestial Moon Sword, had personally slain a Maha, causing a sensation. He had been recorded in the Sword Gate's Chenghua Hall as an exemplar for all Sword Gate disciples, praised and remembered by all.

Baibin Zi understood perfectly. The man before him, Li Zhouwei, was not just the Li Clan Head and a descendant of a Sword Immortal; he was the direct, orthodox blood descendant of Li Tongya!

'A figure like this, wearing the Qingchi sword—a blade that belonged to a past Sword Immortal and a great virtuous cultivator—if he is killed by a Purple Mansion cultivator on Sword Gate territory... Myriad Radiance will surely erupt in shame and humiliation! The Sword Gate can forget about its moral high ground and its reputation as sword cultivators ever again!'

Even now, Baibin Zi had not received a single word from Daoist Master Chengyan. He didn't need to think hard to know why. The Daoist Master must be in some kind of trouble in the Great Void... At any rate, he was their Daoist Master, so Baibin Zi could only frame it charitably in his mind: he was in a "standoff" with the master of the Sword Gate.

'We can't count on the Daoist Master...'

Baibin Zi was lost in thought mid-air. Below, within the spiritual light, the black flames raged. Li Zhouwei had retracted most of his Dharma Arts, his halberd thrusting and stabbing, shadows blurring. He used the black flames' anti-Dharma properties to resist the spiritual light, and had already found his footing against the five-man encirclement.

'What is Baibin Zi spacing out for up there?!'

Yunan Zi was fighting with suffocating frustration, his heart burning. This young man had almost no weaknesses. Not only were his Dharma Arts powerful, but his halberd possessed an anti-Dharma power that shattered flames and magical light with every sweep and thrust. Yunan Zi could only use his own sword to run interference.

Daoist Zhuang at his side excelled in Dharma Arts. Back in the Eastern Sea, his torrential Li Fire had always overwhelmed his enemies. Who knew he would run into a Bright Yang cultivator who didn't fear fire, and who also had anti-Dharma flames that corroded his techniques? He couldn't even use fifty percent of his true strength.

This enraged Yunan Zi. He leveled his sword, pressed two fingers against the blade, and began chanting. Talismans shook loose from his sleeve. Daoist Zhuang, having worked with him for years, reacted instantly, crushing a green gourd and shouting, "Trap him first!"

The two cultivators on the flanks exchanged a look and each pulled a chain of purple, water-patterned links from their sleeves, gripping the Dharma Artifacts as they chanted.

Li Zhouwei seized the opportunity to pull his halberd free from the swamp of Dharma Arts. The flames of the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts flared, finally calming the five or six gales of Radiant Essence that had been swirling around him.

In the span of a single move, Li Zhouwei suddenly raised his halberd, the light between his brows surging. Four of his opponents scattered, but the last remaining Changxiao cultivator was out of luck. The old man, standing on the wind holding a brown-lacquered peach-wood staff, had no choice but to grit his teeth and block.

Having gained a moment's breath, Li Zhouwei's assault became ferocious. Before the halberd even arrived, the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light struck first. The old man raised his tortoise-shell-like defensive artifact. With a tremendous *BOOM*, white light and flames exploded against the shell, sending it flying backward.

Only then did the halberd arrive, trailing raging black flames and a turbulent wave of spiritual qi.

With the swarm of Dharma Arts no longer tying him down, Li Zhouwei attacked with his full strength, golden flames practically leaping from his pupils. The old man was scared witless. He raised his peach-wood staff high, his Immortal Foundation spinning as a wave of brownish-yellow power surged forth.

*BOOM!*

The old man was no expert in artifact combat. The few techniques he specialized in had already been broken, and now he was suddenly taking such a ferocious hit. Fortunately, the peach-wood staff had some life-saving properties. The Dharma Artifact let out a low, mournful cry.

*CRACK!*

The halberd suddenly swept sideways. Its bright, crescent-shaped blade flashed. The old man felt an overwhelming, uncontrollable force transmit from his hands. The peach-wood staff was instantly ripped from his grasp, hooked by the halberd, and sent flying high into the air.

"Not good!"

The staff struggled wildly in the air. The old man was, after all, a direct descendant of Changxiao. He immediately formed a seal, and the staff turned into a brown speck of light, trying to pierce the void and return to his hand.

*BOOM!*

But the pristine white Radiant Pass appeared, smashing down on the speck of light. The technique was instantly shattered by the suppressive force, revealing the artifact's true form, firmly pinning it below.

'There's a reason the Wei and Li families often use halberds... Combined with this Immortal Foundation, it truly is the Dao of Suppression...'

The old man, having lost his artifact, was humiliated. But thankfully, Daoist Zhuang's green gourd was already active, pouring forth a torrent of white water that descended with overwhelming spiritual qi.

Li Zhouwei immediately felt the wind of heavenly light gathering at his feet weaken. He knew at once:

"A Water Mansion Dharma Artifact!"

The raging Water Mansion washed over his feet. Before the water even touched him, the spiritual wind supporting him had completely dissipated, leaving only a fading spark of heavenly light beneath him as he hovered in the air.

He stomped thin air, and a jade mountain appeared beneath his feet. The mountain expanded rapidly, revealing vivid clouds, immortal cranes, and ancient pines. In less than two breaths, it had firmly planted itself in the water.

Li Zhouwei stood atop the Jade-Mist Mountain. The Jade True Dharma Artifact flared with light, forcing the surrounding Water Mansion to part. But two purple, patterned chains were already flying toward him, seeking to bind him. Li Zhouwei had always despised these binding-type artifacts. He had no choice but to raise his halberd and parry them.

"Hah!"

A sharp shout echoed from above. Yunan Zi had drawn his sword. He took a mouthful of clear water and spat it onto the blade, unleashing a wave of azure-green, gloomy light.

*Shoo…*

The profound light shot from the sword, seeming to take the weapon's own spirituality with it. The Geng Metal radiance that had covered the blade vanished completely, leaving only a hollow, dim sword body.

Yunan Zi cultivated True Qi and had practiced Dharma Arts for many years. His casting speed was extreme. He left the sword hanging in the air and pulled a jade talisman from his waist, clutching it as he immediately began preparing his next technique.

Li Zhouwei, however, grew serious. The Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner unfurled violently, blasting five-colored Li Fire to temporarily hold back the two purple chains. He thrust his halberd upward. *Clang!* He struck the azure-green light from the air.

The profound light flickered and disappeared.

Li Zhouwei swept his halberd back, blasting apart the techniques on either side and stirring up a wave of spiritual qi. But his golden eyes were still searching the air.

He knew from that first clash that this thing was unusual. It seemed to be some kind of Dharma Art condensed with metal essence, difficult to disperse. To make matters worse, the spiritual light from the ring above was constantly falling, suppressing his own techniques.

He silently swallowed a pill. His two black-flame arms swept their halberds into the Li Fire to fend off the two purple chains. He glanced at Yunan Zi hiding in the back and stepped forward into the void, his Jade-Mist Mountain suddenly rising.

*CLANG!*

The azure-green light was getting faster, dodging his halberd several times. Only thanks to the suppressive influence of the Jade-Mist Mountain was he able to knock it from the air.

This great mountain of the Jade True Dao Lineage had appeared at the perfect time. It radiated beams of white light, coordinating with the suppressive power of his Bright Yang. When Daoist Zhuang saw him searching the air and realizing he was using the Dao of Suppression, he knew Li Zhouwei wanted to pin his martial uncle's azure-green light. Zhuang hurried forward, stirring up his Li Fire.

Li Zhouwei controlled his artifact, which suddenly flew out of the Water Mansion. It shone brightly, but instead of attacking the nearest target, it pressed down on Daoist Zhuang.

By ignoring the others like this, the azure-green light was able to escape. It found an opening and slammed into his back. The scales of his Yuan'E Soft Armor instantly stood on end. The light around Li Zhouwei dimmed, and the technique shot away again.

But the mountain pressing down on him sent Daoist Zhuang's soul fleeing. His techniques were strong, and in an instant, he turned into a streak of fire and scattered, gritting his teeth. "If Martial Brother Yufu hadn't fallen overseas, how could this beast be so arrogant!"

But the jade mountain did not chase him. Instead, it *boomed* as it smashed down onto the green gourd.

'The most critical piece here is Daoist Zhuang's Water Mansion artifact. I'm already suppressed by the spiritual light from the sky, and this artifact scattered my movement technique. I was trapped on the Jade-Mist Mountain, waiting to be besieged!'

The gourd was not a defensive artifact. Pinned by both an Immortal Foundation and a Dharma Artifact, it instantly began to wail, faring even worse than the wooden staff. In a moment, it was seized by the Radiant Pass above.

As Li Zhouwei broke free, three Dharma Arts exploded against him. His armor brightened rapidly, every scale humming.

The next instant, he transformed into a brilliant streak of heavenly light, as fast as a fish darting through water, and vanished within the golden mist.

The light-shifting ability of the Yuan'E Soft Armor!

A sense of crisis erupted in Yunan Zi's heart. The jade talisman in his hand was only half-lit when a blinding heavenly light shone in his eyes, so bright it seemed to scorch his face. He was forced to abandon his technique, sweeping his sleeve to release a black halo.

*CRACK!*

The halberd stabbed the halo. His hastily deployed defense was useless; it shattered into motes of light. The halberd's light flew in, and the Radiant Pass from behind Li Zhouwei shot forward as well.

Yunan Zi's technique was rushed. He was still reeling, his feathered robes ringing as sparks flew. He couldn't just wait to die. Using the moment his opponent's technique faltered, his figure vanished and reappeared several dozen feet away.

But the halberd pursued him relentlessly. It made a small turn, the crescent blade stabbing at him again. This time, Yunan Zi had a moment to breathe and was much calmer. He flicked a jade bead from his sleeve to block it.

Who knew the halberd would just hook and slap the bead aside? Li Zhouwei completely ignored the sword and techniques chasing him from behind. His two extra arms didn't even turn to defend, but instead brought their own halberds stabbing forward.

"How dare this demonic disciple be so savage!"

Yunan Zi's mouth was full of shock and anger, but his legs were already moving. Most of his Immortal Foundation's wonders were related to Dharma Arts. Changxiao Gate was a great Dao lineage of techniques; almost none of them practiced artifact combat. Their swords were only for casting. How could he possibly fight this man up close? He turned and fled.

As he dashed away, the sound of flames and water exploded behind him. Spiritual light shot everywhere as Li Zhouwei blocked the surrounding attacks. With another loud shockwave, Li Zhouwei burst out of the flames and shot directly toward him!

The golden-eyed man was now covered in fire. The scales of his Yuan'E Soft Armor were baked red, glowing faintly under the extreme strain. Li Zhouwei used the armor to shift through light and close the distance, the mantra in his mouth having hummed for some time. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light between his brows was condensed to its absolute limit:

'Shine upon the Eight Desolations, let all bow to me... Ten thousand spirits look up, the Shangyao is the Celestial God!'

After three consecutive pursuits, the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light finally erupted into a brilliant white column of light as thick as a water bucket. Yunan Zi's pupils were instantly enveloped by the boundless, brilliant light.

He finally understood why his opponent had chased him three times without giving him a single moment to react.

'We're outside the range of the Yongjing Profound Ring!'

*BOOM!*

A gray light shield suddenly erupted from Yunan Zi's body. The searing Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light spread over the entire shield like molten baleful earth. He felt his entire body burning and yelled through clenched teeth, "Baibin Zi!"

His voice was immediately drowned in the light, which was now mixed with black flames that slammed against the shield, hissing and sizzling.

Yunan Zi was confident in the strength of his talisman and wasn't afraid. In fact, he was enraged that such a precious talisman had to be used, and a venomous sneer crossed his face.

But as he looked up, he vaguely saw a glint of gold within the flashing light.

'What is that…'

In an instant, his vision cleared. He saw a small, palm-sized vial engraved with crimson-gold Li Fire patterns. It was tilting.

From the mouth of the vial, a single drop of liquid slowly trickled out. It was extremely viscous, and the liquid itself was covered in patterns of a terrifying apricot-yellow.

Fear, belatedly, seized Yunan Zi. He wanted to move, but realized that all the brilliant light surrounding him was only there to trap him.

*Drip.*

Li Zhouwei snapped his halberd back. The halberd swept out a crescent of wind, carrying dense black flames that blasted the pursuing Li Fire and Water Mansion into a shower of light. As the halberd returned, the five cultivators chasing him all retreated a step.

*BOOM!*

A dazzling, apricot-yellow light shot into the sky. The others couldn't help but squint. Lake Xian, already colorful, was now reflected as a pure golden lake. A massive torrent of Li Fire instantly filled the sky, so powerful that even the glowing ring above dimmed slightly.

Daoist Zhuang looked stunned. He was swept by the intense Li Fire, and his robes began to burn with apricot flames. But as a Li Fire cultivator himself, he was already in the best shape of the group. He batted at the flames on his robes while looking up.

The apricot light dimmed slightly, finally revealing the scene.

A violent storm of Li Fire was rising from behind the golden-eyed man. As the apricot flames rolled over him from behind, Li Zhouwei raised one hand, the edge of his Grand Ascension Halberd pointed flatly at the five men. The circular core of the halberd pulsed with rings of light.

That little speck of azure-green light had lost its spirituality. It drifted sluggishly within the halberd's core, its once-sharp form having been baked into an oval shape, struggling feebly.

Li Zhouwei stood there, armored and holding his halberd. Behind him was the light of True Qi, suppressed by the Li Fire. The falling phenomenon of the cultivator's death was transforming into gentle, ethereal immortal cranes. They had only just managed to flap gracefully in the air three or four times before they were swiftly consumed by the fire and fell from the sky.

'Yunan Zi is dead! The esteemed direct descendant of a Purple Mansion, Yunan Zi, just died like that!'

The lake was golden. The dawn was brilliant. Li Fire ascended, and white cranes fell. Amidst the bright apricot glow, Li Zhouwei's halberd seemed to gather all the golden light in the world, dazzling the eyes of the remaining cultivators.

And his cold voice echoed across the lake:

"A direct descendant of Changxiao, is this all you are."
