# Chapter 502: Obtaining The Fruit

Although Li Yuanjiao had mentioned this deer demon to her before, this was the first time Li Qinghong had met the deer demon. Not wanting to reveal too much to him, she kept the explanation of her abilities short.

Realization dawned upon Luken as he said solemnly, "Ah, so Fairy is the Li Family's thunder cultivator... Please excuse my rudeness!"

His attitude became much more respectful as he politely said, "Your Profound Thunderpool is the nemesis of the tiger demon's Hurricane Ghost Yin... It is as good as caught already."

Li Qinghong slowed down to keep pace with the deer demon.

"Is it really that easy to deal with the Quanwu Demon Den...?"

Luken nodded and explained, "Yue State is unlike the southern border and the Eastern Sea. Mount Quanwu or Quanwu Demon Den is called Mount Zuiliu by the demonic creatures in the southern border."[1]

He then added slowly, "Quanwu was originally the residence of a Purple Mansion Realm demon king. This demon was once the mount of a Golden Core Realm cultivator and had some influence over the southern border and Jiangnan. He lived in Quanwu... Whenever a demon den was destroyed in the southern border, the demon king of Quanwu would entice the suffering demons to Quanwu with pills and elixirs."

"At that time, Dongli Immortal Sect was still around. Yue State had four sects and twelve gates. If a disciple needed to find a mount, kill a demon, practice spells, or refine a dharma artifact, they would go to Mount Quanwu. Later, the demon king disappeared, and the mountain gradually declined after being replaced by Dali Demon Den. Nevertheless, there are still demons seeking refuge on Mount Quanwu from time to time... It became the place where the demons that escaped from the southern border stayed."

After hearing this explanation, Li Qinghong was not surprised one bit and merely remarked, "Ah... so they're demons that have escaped from the southern border. I guess The Azure Pond Sect is leaving them be because this is what they want."

"Yes," Luken smiled, feeling a little emotional as he said, "That place is also a treasure trove. The Azure Pond Sect deliberately kept it, waiting for these demons to escape and take out the treasures. No matter how they are circulated, they will eventually fall into the hands of the three sects, seven gates, and clans."

"Besides, if they catch an important demon, they can use it as a bargaining chip to threaten the southern border. At worst, they can make it into a spirit beast... There are just too many benefits, so they have been secretly supporting it," he added.

Li Qinghong frowned and whispered, "Then doesn't that mean that place is the backyard of the Azure Pond Sect? If we kill the tiger demon, I guess we'll have to take care of things within the sect too..."

Luken was momentarily taken aback, then waved his hand dismissively.

"No worries, I've already investigated and made sure that this tiger demon is a nobody. Otherwise, I wouldn't dare bring you there, Fairy..."

He then grumbled to himself inwardly, How could I not investigate first? Your Li Family has backing in Azure Pond Sect, so there's a way to resolve matters even if you offend someone. I'm just an insignificant deer demon; I can't afford to make enemies!

Li Qinghong considered the implications for a moment and thought, If we can rob it, we won't kill it. It's best to avoid more trouble...

Both of them began discussing significant events from recent years and found the conversation to be enlightening. Ahead of them, Mount Quanwu soon came into view.

While Mount Quanwu was not particularly tall, it was vast and imposing, located near the Mushroom Forest Plain, as well as the Cangwu and Helin Prefectures. Surrounded by a large plain, the mountains stood out prominently, concealing many demons within their depths and making them hard to detect.

As the deer demon led her into the mountain, they wound around until they reached an inconspicuous peak. As soon as he descended, he was surprised.

The cave entrance was wide open, and it was dark and foreboding inside. After scanning with his spiritual sense, Luken said awkwardly, "Fairy, this tiger demon is quite cautious. He's likely moved to a new cave and isn't here anymore!"

"Huh...?"

Li Qinghong was surprised too.

However, Luken rolled his sleeves up and said, "Don't worry; just watch me."

He landed, listened attentively, and conversed with the surrounding trees for a while. After walking more than ten li, they spotted a mountain persimmon tree hidden among the vines with yellow fruits hanging from its branches.

Luken performed a hand seal, and almost instantly, the fruits jumped off from the branches one by one and chatted for a moment. With a smile, the deer demon turned to Li Qinghong and said, "Fairy, the tiger demon has gone north."

"Good!" Li Qinghong praised, her gaze shifting to the yellow mountain persimmon's branches and leaves. A rustling noise ensued.

Luken listened for a moment and then relayed the message to her with a smile, "She said she is thirty-seven years away from gaining sentience and begs Fairy to spare her life and a hundred years of hard work..."

Li Qinghong had indeed considered bringing the spirit mountain persimmon back with her. Hearing Luken's message, she paused in surprise.

"I can't believe it has intelligence! Fellow Daoist, you can communicate with plants and trees?! How many spirit trees like this are there?"

"Not many..." Luken replied, but continued regretfully in a soft voice, "What good is gaining sentience? She needs thirty-seven years to become a Qi Cultivation Realm spirit root. After that, she will require hundreds of years to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm... Having to live under the mercy of others for so long with spiritual awareness will just increase her suffering."

Li Qinghong observed the tree for a while, realizing an Embryonic Breathing Realm spirit root was indeed not that useful to the Li Family compared to one that would be of the Qi Cultivation Realm. With that in mind, she said softly, "Then I'll come back in thirty-seven years..."

With a wave of her hand, a formation plate flew out of her pouch and landed in front of the tree. A small Embryonic Breathing illusory formation sprang up around it. She flipped her hand and inserted three Spirit Stones, enough to sustain it for many years.

Luken stroked his beard, watching from the side. Li Qinghong smiled and added, "With the current situation, I may not be able to wait for thirty-seven years. By that time, my Li family's descendants will come."

"You're being too modest, Fairy. You are blessed and have the potential to reach the Purple Mansion Realm," Luken commented, shaking his head.

The two of them continued riding the wind together, conversing until they soon arrived in front of a small hill. Luken glanced at it and whispered, "Yes, it should be here."

Li Qinghong addressed him directly, "How do you plan to handle this, fellow Daoist?"

"I'm afraid the tiger demon will escape, and it will be difficult to pursue it. Although we are swift in riding the wind, the tiger demon's Hurricane Ghost Yin is equally fast. Why don't I go in first and engage it? Once the monster has exhausted most of its strength, you can intervene and catch it off guard, Fairy. Your thunder technique is powerful and we'll surely succeed," he suggested.

Li Qinghong was not entirely convinced by his proposal. She sighed inwardly, If only I still had Kong Tingyun's Emerald Jade Plate formation artifact with me... It would make things so much easier!

However, Luken had already flown forward, wielding an ax that shimmered with turquoise light. In an instant, it grew to the size of a house and came crashing down onto the low hill, shaking it with a thunderous rumble. Rubble cascaded down instantly, and a thick layer of dust filled the air.

I knew it, these demons lack legacies and rely solely on their brute strength and dharma artifacts which is quite simplistic... This technique seems to have been developed by himself, and it's not half bad.

Luken had indeed crafted the ax in his hand himself. He had likely read a few low-grade manuals on refining artifacts and dedicated years to mastering it. However, it still could not compare to the Duruo Spear she wielded.

Awoooooooooo...!

A tiger roar echoed in the air, and a powerful man with a bare upper body rose from the mountain. Black mist swirled around him as he bellowed in a deep voice, "Demon general! We are never enemies; why come to my den and provoke me?!"

Luken, who had been kind and respectful in Li Qinghong's presence, now revealed his arrogant side and sneered.

"Hand over the treasured panacea you possess and save ourselves from a fight! If you refuse to comply, I'll have to kill you and take it myself!"

1. Mount Zuiliu can be interpreted in two ways—Mount Flowing Sin or Mount Refuge ☜

Luken, being in the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm himself, exuded a powerful aura that was rather imposing.

The tiger demon looked at him with doubt, frowning as he replied, "I do not wish to provoke nor fight you."

The tiger demon was unwilling to even fight. As his immortal foundation surged, gusts of yin wind enveloped him, and with the aid of the black mist, he shot away like an arrow.

Luken was taken aback; the tiger demons he had encountered in the demon den were typically reckless and short-tempered. He had not expected one to be so cautious.

Stunned for a moment, he jumped up and cursed, "Cowardly tiger!"

He swung the ax in his hand, unleashing a few ax qi the size of horse carriages at the tiger demon, who nimbly evaded the attacks and continued to flee.

"Gosh... I knew this would happen!" Li Qinghong sighed loudly as she shook her head helplessly, seeing the scenario she had feared finally unfold before her very eyes.

Despite Luken's advanced age, he had spent years in the demon den, sheltered by others while focusing on his cultivation. He believed the tiger demon would be impulsive enough to fight to the death over a few provocations.

How could he possibly be a reckless creature and still manage to survive in this mountain? Luken's decisiveness and confidence were even more surprising to me.

She hooked her slender finger, causing her jade-like digits to glow with purple light as she drew a talisman in the air. Thunder suddenly rumbled and black smoke billowed as her thunder talisman was gradually condensed.

Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique!

Li Qinghong focused intently on her spell, stepping onto a bolt of lightning as she chased after the tiger demon at an incredible speed, the thunder talisman in her hand ready to be unleashed.

Swoosh!

The tiger demon swayed in the wind, distancing himself and avoiding Luken's attack. Intent on escaping, he had not anticipated that a beautiful female cultivator would fly toward him, wielding a surge of thunderlight. The purple glow surrounding her radiated great power.

"Fairy... Ah...!"

Black qi surged in the tiger demon's hands as he shouted in confusion, not daring to take a direct hit. He attempted to put distance between himself and his pursuers, trying to ward off the attacks by pushing black qi forward.

Suddenly, lightning flashed, igniting his hands and leaving his face scorched and bloodied, nearly revealing his true form.

Shit! This deer demon specifically brought a thunder cultivator to target me!

As a cultivator who practiced the Hurricane Ghost Yin, he was inherently weak against attacks involving light and thunder.

His apprehension deepened when he saw the long spear in Li Qinghong's hand, its white jade-like appearance indicated it was no ordinary weapon.

His courage faltered.

Wielding a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact and top-tier spell; she must belong to one of the three sects!

As black tiger fur began sprouting on his face and his body began to swell, he cried out miserably, "I am willing to hand over the treasure!"

Luken frowned but continued swinging his ax. Li Qinghong's thunder spear transformed into a shadow, circling him and cutting off his escape route as she urged, "Hand over the treasured panacea quickly, and you shall be spared!"

The tiger demon reacted swiftly. With one hand, he produced a jade box while using the other to channel black qi to resist Luken's ax, retreating several steps in the process.

Li Qinghong launched the jade box into the air with her Duruo Spear and soared up into the sky to retrieve it. She scanned it with her spiritual sense, confirming that it indeed contained the Blood Sun Fruit. With a quick flick of her wrist, she stored it away just as the tiger demon surged a li away, propelled by the wind.

Li Qinghong propelled herself forward amidst purple light, still chasing after him. As the black qi flowed in the tiger demon's palms, he transformed into his original form.

The black tiger loomed as large as a hill, surrounded by a strong wind and swirling black qi. Its bloodshot eyes glinted with malevolence, and dark yin energy clung to it. Roaring, it unleashed sound waves that shocked both Luken and Li Qinghong.

"Since it is the Exalted Immortal who demands the treasured panacea, you can have it as I cannot afford to offend you. However..."

The tiger demon adopted a desperate demeanor, growling fiercely as he continued, "You two will be sorry If you continue to push me further!"

Although this tiger demon had a higher cultivation level than Li Qinghong, he had witnessed the strength of a disciple from the three sects. Fearful of Li Qinghong, he seemed restless, gritting his teeth as he attempted to intimidate Luken.

What a tiger demon...

Li Qinghong glanced at Luken beside her and noticed his fear. Previously, he had been the one who suggested killing the tiger demon, but now, he was the first to show fear.

She could not help but snicker inwardly to herself in amusement.

Most demon cultivators are indeed bullies... The tiger demon is more domineering in a low-key manner but becomes fearful when pushed.

Li Qinghong raised an eyebrow and assured calmly, "Don't be nervous, fellow Daoist. I simply want to ask where you have obtained this spirit fruit."

The black tiger visibly relaxed, and he became noticeably more polite in speech as he asked, "Which sect do you represent, Fairy?"

Li Qinghong laughed and replied ambiguously, "I came from the north."

Realization dawned upon the tiger demon as he breathed a sigh of relief.

So, she's a mountain master from the Yue Cultivating Sect. No wonder she spared my life... I guess she wouldn't have wasted her breath talking to me if she were from the devil gate...

He promptly replied respectfully, "Mountain Master, I came from the southern border. I obtained this fruit from the Wu State on the southern border..."

He then transformed into his human form and told the story of how he had obtained the fruit in detail. It was just an ordinary treasure hunting story that shed no useful information.

Li Qinghong frowned and said, "Since you are familiar with the southern border, do keep an eye out for news of this treasure in the future... Maybe I will come again in a few years. If you obtain more of this fruit, you'll be rewarded."

The tiger demon was overjoyed. Li Qinghong did not want to make an enemy, so she was not going to complain. This treasured panacea was just a tonic for him, saving him ten years of cultivation. He had no one to rely on in Yue State, and it was rare for a disciple from the upper sect to befriend him.

"I understand. Well, this fruit shall be a gift for meeting you," he replied politely.

Li Qinghong glanced at him and felt that this tiger demon behaved more like a human rather than a demon.

"How thoughtful, fellow Daoist..." she commented with an arched brow.

The tiger demon lowered his head and did not answer. Li Qinghong was naturally delighted to be able to obtain the treasure by simply just demanding it. She waved her hand happily and said, "Let's go!"

Luken nodded and followed, and the two rode out on the wind. Li Qinghong got the treasure without much effort and was in a good mood.

Luken stroked his beard and found the entire situation to be strange.

Is this how prominent clans work? The human race is truly strange in their ways... To think that they even turn enemies into friends!

Although he was old, he had been cultivating in the cave for many years and every seclusion lasted at least a decade. Not only that, but the interactions between demons were usually straightforward, hence they were not sophisticated creatures.

Now that he had been out of the cave as a demon general for only more than ten years, he had even less time to deal with people. Combined with the childish mistakes he had made before, regret welled into his heart.

No wonder... No wonder this tiger demon can cultivate in Mount Quanwu for so long... It could survive all this time probably because he is tactful... There is indeed a lot I can learn from these two individuals!

At this moment, he suddenly became much more enthusiastic. Li Qinghong did not understand the sudden shift in the deer demon's demeanor, but she continued chatting with him.

She took the Blood Sun Fruit out from the jade box and carefully checked it several times. Upon verifying that it was of good quality and she did not make a mistake, she finally let out a sigh of relief.

The two flew toward Mount Qingdu, and the deer demon finally left, albeit reluctantly. Li Qinghong landed in front of the mountain and counted the days.

Only more than a month had passed.
