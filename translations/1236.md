# Chapter 1236: Sensed Restraint Brings Annihilation

'Is Pit Water… truly that important to the Golden Oneness? Is controlling the Metal Virtue not enough that they must also watch over the Water Virtue? To pay such a great price just to make Xiao Chuting concede!'

Li Que'wan's gaze shifted from the spiritual item with ease as clouds of doubt suddenly billowed in her heart, her eyes shining with clarity.

'If Senior Xiao Chuting cannot succeed... would Su Yan be able to? The Water Virtue is the exclusive domain of the Dragon-kin; I fear not even Luoxia is confident they can raise a Water Virtue True Monarch!'

She suppressed these doubts in the depths of her heart, saying nothing more, and replied in a manner that was neither servile nor overbearing:

"This junior will be sure to convey the Upper Sect's intentions."

But as she lowered her eyes, the multicolored light in the lake's water faintly reflected in them. Li Que'wan suddenly felt a chill rush to her heart, surging up her meridians and into her mind as countless illusions abruptly appeared before her, her eyes aching with a sharp pain!

'This is…'

The Bright Yang radiance of the great lake suddenly dimmed, and the white flowers standing to one side blurred in an instant; the world stood still as her vision seemed to magnify infinitely, passing through the lake, across the surging waters of the Bright Yang Lake, and through the magnificent, sprawling Profound Gates and Daoist temples submerged beneath, finally sinking to the ice-crystal lakebed crafted from a spiritual item of Veiled Yin, following a trail of azure mist that seemed to stretch from an infinite distance until at last she saw a speck of gold.

It was a shard of golden, glazed glass, the size of a quail's egg.

This speck of gold felt as if it would burn through her pupils. The Talisman Seed in Li Que'wan's sea of qi began to vibrate madly, every inch of her intuition responding, telling her just how precious the object before her was.

An Immortal Mirror fragment!

'It's at the Golden Feather Sect!'

The shock in her heart was like a landslide and a tsunami, all her previous worries and doubts forcibly suppressed and replaced by this profound astonishment.

'The Golden Feather Sect has a piece… within their own mountain gates…'

An eternity seemed to pass in her consciousness, yet it might have been only an instant. The momentary daze became the shock of seeing a supreme Bright Yang treasure. In just a flash, Li Que'wan had already composed her expression, silently pursing her lips.

Tianhuo gave her a deep look and said:

"I trust King Wei can make a choice that aligns with his heart."

As his voice fell, the mist on both sides rapidly closed in again, its color gradually shifting from white to azure. That region of land seemed to be receding at high speed, and Tianhuo's figure had already vanished. Zhang Duanyan's golden-robed form then appeared behind her, politely saying:

"Please!"

Li Que'wan appeared somewhat hesitant on the surface, but the shock and complexity in her heart were like a brewing, formless storm blocking her chest. She followed him down the steps, secretly forming a sign with her fingers.

'Spirit Probe!'

That supreme Spirit Probe vision swept out, crashing into the dense azure mist, whittling it down bit by bit. But as the mist receded, what was exposed to her vision was a sealed cave dwelling suffused with purple qi. True Fire danced within, where a cultivator sat cross-legged, consolidating a divine ability.

'Tianque.'

'A Great Daoist Master!'

Had she obtained this secret information under normal circumstances, Li Que'wan would have been secretly alarmed, but her attention was now completely off Tianque as she desperately searched for the location of that great lake.

'No Tianhuo… no Bright Yang spiritual root…'

That profound location had vanished as if it were an illusion.

But since Li Que'wan had seen the Immortal Artifact fragment, how could any of this be an illusion!

'The dense white mist that surged up was definitely no ordinary thing… and the path back had none of the ascending azure steps from the way here. That place just now isn't in the Golden Feather Sect at all!'

'A mystic realm? A grotto-heaven?'

Or perhaps… a Dharma Treasure?

The Esteemed Upper Azure Palace?

Her heart trembled, but her face showed hesitation as she walked the entire way in deep thought. Zhang Duanyan assumed she was hesitating over the Xiao family matter and did not disturb her, silently leading the way. Before long, they reached the mountainside, where Zhang Duanyan suddenly smiled.

"Old senior!"

There, amidst a surging fire vein in the mountains, an old man in red robes was sitting, holding a long, thin bronze ladle in his hand and peering into the fire vein. It was Ji'an!

Li Que'wan had an answer in an instant.

'My brother asked him to find the Golden Feather Sect, and he really did.'

She temporarily suppressed the shock in her heart and smiled.

"Greetings, Senior!"

"What a coincidence."

Ji'an's eyes lit up, and he nodded with a smile, but upon seeing Li Que'wan's worried expression, a flash of understanding crossed his eyes.

'The matter of the Whole Pill is important. Even the Li clan must bend a knee and come to pay a visit… severing their own Dao path…'

Li Que'wan's mind was long elsewhere, but she still replied politely. Ji'an, however, smiled and said:

"Wait a few days. Once I've collected this spiritual fire, I'll head up to the lake."

It had always been the Golden Feather Sect using other families, and rarely others using them. It was obvious this meeting was intentional, a signal that the Golden Feather Sect was fully aware and was deliberately cooperating with the Li clan—regardless of whether the lake acknowledged the favor, they would not let other families use them for free.

Li Que'wan forced a smile, cupped her hands in farewell, and only upon reaching the foot of the mountain did she bow in salute.

"Many thanks to the Upper Sect for the guidance."

Zhang Duanyan smiled gently, returned the salute, and said:

"There's no guidance to speak of, it is all for the sake of friendship."

Her figure also scattered like golden sand, leaving only Li Que'wan standing quietly in the Great Void. She took one last look back at the Supreme Yang talisman that had hung high above for several hundred years, illuminating the entire Golden Feather Sect's mountain gate, then rode the wind away with a heart full of complicated feelings, disappearing into the darkness of the Great Void.

The entire Great Void was thus plunged into endless, profound darkness. From a perspective no one could detect, a white, illusory figure slowly emerged, gazing distantly at the magnificent, undulating mountains below.

'The Esteemed Upper Azure Palace.'

The golden light in his pupils slowly faded, the shock in them seeming even more profound than the woman's had been just now.

It was not that the fragment had startled him; from the moment Li Que'wan set out for the Golden Feather Sect, he had been watching her intently. Out of vigilance toward the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, he had remained on high alert, even instantly smoothing over all the anomalies brought by the Talisman Seed's vibrations. From Li Que'wan at the Golden Feather Sect to the unprotected Li Jiangqian in the great desert, nothing unusual was revealed.

And what was reflected in his pupils was this magnificent immortal mountain range.

In the two-hundred-some years of the Li clan's development, this was the first time he had ever set foot in this place, this mysterious immortal mountain of the Golden Oneness.

This place was entirely different from the many sect grounds he had seen—it was even somewhat ordinary. For the grand Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, apart from a purple qi cave dwelling worth mentioning, the rest seemed unremarkable. Every cultivation art was locked down tight, there were no mystic realms to speak of, and although it was connected to a grotto-heaven, it was rigorously isolated from the Great Void.

The only thing that attracted him was the Supreme Yang talisman in the sky.

As he slowly raised his head, the perspective of the world instantly zoomed in. The brilliant golden light continuously receded, revealing the talisman's true form.

The paper was coarse and pale yellow, looking much like the yellow paper of a common household, but the ink was peculiar, carrying a wondrous golden radiance, using Supreme Yang Sun Essence as its medium. It was not complex, nor was it some supreme profound pattern, but six seal characters.

Small seal script, like that of the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core.

"Sun and Moon, Sensed Restraint Brings Annihilation."

The radiance from it drifted down, seemingly as gentle as the flowing light of dawn, yet it exuded a supreme status.

'The personal writing of a Dao Embryo!'

'What a magnificent protective talisman!'

This was not, in essence, a talisman, but six characters left behind by a Dao Embryo. And it was precisely these six characters that separated this mountain gate from the outside world, and even more so, completely sealed off the grotto-heaven behind it from the entire Great Void!

'And Supreme Yang… is clearly not a Daoist tradition of concealment!'

Lu Jiangxian could clearly sense the marvel within it. Although it existed between yin and yang, it possessed the intent of transformation, and even a hint of the flavor of Cultivation Transcendence. This was not common and was highly distinctive.

'It's almost certainly… that great cultivator who held yin to cross yang, Crossing Holder. The great personage who sent out the Sun Seeker Ring and prophesied that the Bright Yang Imperial Monarch would be slain… Evolving Splendor… so this is that Evolving Splendor. Taiyuan's Azure Profoundity Daoist Tradition originated from here!'

'No wonder that Dharma Treasure is called the Esteemed Upper Azure Palace! No wonder he pushed for the thunderous collapse of the Great Wei!'

'People say this talisman used six strands of Supreme Yang Sun Essence, but it's actually just the ink of six characters from someone's hand! With yang manifest and yin hidden, what lower-level cultivators, even Golden Core cultivators, can sense is merely six strands of Supreme Yang Sun Essence!'

Who was this meant to be seen by?

'Naturally, the Dao Embryos of the north and south!'

Lu Jiangxian could sense that the power within it was not particularly strong; or rather, when that Dao Embryo wrote this back then, it was not intended as a trump card. The emphasis was on status, not power. It was merely a written order, but it was already enough.

'So He is still called Taiyuan.'

This was the first time Lu Jiangxian had seen seal script outside of the immortal stele. He gazed at it for a long time with a complex expression. The golden ring in his hand flickered, and several large characters similarly appeared.

'Lu Jiangxian of the Green Pine Temple.'

It was also six characters, but the handwriting was clearly different.

Having confirmed this matter, he finally looked away with a sense of loss.

In that fleeting moment, the marvel of simultaneously encompassing both sun and moon had made Lu Jiangxian wonder if this person might be his reincarnation. But this Dao Embryo cultivator, Crossing Holder, had most likely gone beyond the heavens. At that realm of cultivation, it was unlikely he would have forgotten any past life. Since he had said, "pity the ancestor's object will be scattered among the common folk," and the handwriting was so different, it was almost certainly not him.

Only then did he turn his head to look at the dense, bottomless Great Void.

Li Que'wan's guess was correct. In that instant, she had indeed been inside the Dharma Treasure, and that Dharma Treasure was indeed the Esteemed Upper Azure Palace!

'That fragment is inside the Dharma Treasure.'

When the fragment appeared just now, the Dharma Treasure was almost completely unguarded. Lu Jiangxian could have even tried to forcefully suppress and seize it to retrieve the item!

'Of course, I'd first have to take on Taiyuan single-handedly, and then shake the entire world…'

But with just that one glance, Lu Jiangxian had a strong premonition that this fragment was fundamentally different from the ones he had obtained before. It contained not only the authority of Supreme Yin, but also that of Supreme Yang!

'And these two authorities have reached an incredibly precise balance.'

This was what shocked him the most. If all the previous fragments he had encountered were like a mirror shattered on the ground, with pieces large and small, and even a jade pendant that had been hanging on the edge, then this piece was like a small mirror that had been precisely carved out, perfectly round without a single crack!

What did this mean?

'Either… someone has the ability to adjust the yin and yang of this fragment, or the Immortal Mirror's main body was absolutely not shattered by an external force—at least, not entirely due to external force or some accident!'

The former possibility was quite low. According to Lu Jiangxian's speculation, at least a Dao Embryo of the yin-yang path might have such an ability—but it was only a possibility.

The greater likelihood was that someone had tampered with the Immortal Mirror before it shattered, extracting this piece from its very center! It might even be the very reason for the subsequent shattering.

'How did Taiyuan obtain it?!'

Lu Jiangxian was no longer the same Lu Jiangxian who had first encountered the fragments. As the emotions in his heart calmed in an instant, he quickly found an answer.

'If all my guesses are correct, this piece is likely the final step to completing the Immortal Mirror!'

This was easy to deduce. If completing the Immortal Artifact now was like assembling a puzzle, one would naturally piece together the silent Supreme Yin first before moving on to the Supreme Yang. And this piece was likely the round hole left in the center of the mirror's surface after all the other fragments were pieced together!

'Only… Taiyuan isn't just using a Dharma Treasure to lock this item away; he's using it to help Qiushui achieve a breakthrough!'

Even in that fleeting glimpse, he had still seen the top-tier configuration within the Dharma Treasure. With the help of this fragment, using supreme yin and yang to simulate lead and mercury, Qiushui's chances of breaking through would be pushed to their absolute peak once again.

'Truly making the best use of things…'

The value of this information was already immense; at the very least, it let him know where his final step should land. He could not help but admire the True Monarch's planning. Taking one last look at the talisman in the sky, the darkness around him rapidly receded, and he reappeared in that world of piled white snow, his gaze lowering to fall upon the table.

A jade slip lay in the very center.

The Secret Method of the Submerged Flood Dragon Seeking Transformation.

'Xiao Chuting.'

This was also a matter he had long pondered and felt should be treated with solemnity.

Did Xiao Chuting send this secret method across a thousand miles to place a piece in the Chen family? To secretly collude with the Li family? To declare his firm stance in opposition to the Golden Oneness?

No, in Lu Jiangxian's view, all of these were superficial covers.

'He sent it for me to see. This is the unspoken understanding between him and me that has continued to this day.'

Lu Jiangxian's gaze was calm.

'He is telling me by what method he intends to seek gold.'

The Secret Method of the Submerged Flood Dragon Seeking Transformation? Not at all. This was, in fact, an outline for a method of seeking gold!

And it was precisely for this reason that this so-called secret method had the effect of aiding a breakthrough!

Lu Jiangxian's expression was grave.

'This actually reveals two points. First, Xiao Chuting has someone behind him, otherwise he could never have obtained a method for seeking gold. Even if he did, he wouldn't have the time or skill to refine the outline of a gold-seeking method and adapt it into a Dao-seeking method for Chen Yin to use!'

'And the Secret Method of the Submerged Flood Dragon Seeking Transformation secretly revolves around the Vast Ocean… while the rest is not obvious. Xiao Chuting wants to seek Mansion Water, which is why he sought me out, someone who is vaguely a remnant of the Immortal Mansion?'

'And that person behind him… who is it.'

But in Lu Jiangxian's eyes, no matter who was behind him, what Tianhuo said was absolutely correct. In this situation, there was simply no room in this world for him to break through. Chi Buzi could take a risk to attain the Dao, but he did not even have the qualification to take that risk!

'This is an impossible situation; Xiao Chuting's Pit Water is an orthodox position! It is an orthodox position just like Si Boxiu's Upright Wood from all those years ago, and a powerful one at that—one that was thrust into the Vast Ocean, flourishing to the point of overflowing. How could he possibly pursue an intercalary position?'

The words of that spirit creature from back then, "Since you follow the dedicated path, why seek an intercalary position?" still echoed in his ears; he could not possibly fail to heed such a warning!

'The difficulty for him to pursue an intercalary position is several times higher than Si Boxiu's! So high that it is almost impossible! Even the Dragon-kin can't be bothered to stop him…'

'As for seeking Fruition Attainment… how? With his lifespan, he would struggle to cultivate five divine abilities. Even if he had some supreme method, how could he cultivate six divine abilities to seek it? His cultivation itself is already flawed. Without cultivating one's own nature, how can one gain the recognition of an orthodox position?'

'The only possibility is to seek an auxiliary position… alas…'

According to the texts Lu Jiangxian had obtained, orthodox positions were naturally partial to auxiliary ones, so it was possible to seek an auxiliary position even without fruition, but the difficulty would be much higher. Yet, Pit Water was different; for so many years, there had only been those who perished, never any who succeeded in gaining an auxiliary position. Clearly, there was still a problem.

When it came down to it, Xiao Chuting had formed a bond with the Li clan early on. If he could be helped, he would be a source of support in the great Bright Yang affair to come. Lu Jiangxian wished he had as many pieces on the board as possible; he had even held his nose and used Qi Lanyan, so how could he not pay attention to Xiao Chuting!

'If this man had not been born at the wrong time and burdened by worldly affairs, he would absolutely be considered a Golden Core seed. Whether in temperament or Dao-Profundity, he is first-class in the world, exceptionally rare.'

But he cultivated Pit Water, not Supreme Yin. From the current look of things, no matter which path he took, Lu Jiangxian was truly unable to help. Yet he did not simply dismiss the matter; on the contrary, his mind was filled with many thoughts.

'Since there is someone guiding him from behind, he must also know that the lake has little strength to spare. Anything he asks for must be something that can be obtained. Since he sent the outline for me to see, his meaning is already quite clear. There must be a next step!'

'This is very likely just the first step for him and the person behind him! If I wait for some time, he will probably come to the lake, and even if he doesn't, he will reveal related news.'

…

Above the great desert, wind and sand rolled, and spiritual qi was faint. A pale golden grand formation stood in the Great Void, invisibly influencing the cultivators coming and going.

With the Ministerial Fire Seeking Evil Spirit Formation established, the number of people the Li clan sent was not large, leaving the area feeling rather spacious. For one, the Li family originated from the great lake, and most of their lower-level cultivators practiced the Water Virtue, so there were not many cultivators suited to come to this grand formation. Second, Li Jiangzong was cautious in his actions and did not rashly assign manpower, thus it appeared open and free.

On the golden platform, colors converged as dense spiritual qi poured down. A young man in crimson robes stood at a high point with his hands behind his back, gazing out at the great desert, silent and unmoving.

After an unknown amount of time, a person was seen approaching the steps. His features were handsome and distinct, with a somewhat resolute air. It was the clan's Alchemist, Nantanchen—now at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, he was the Foundation Establishment cultivator with the highest attainment in alchemy in the clan, managing the various alchemists and having come to the great desert to concoct pills.

This man was of remnant clan origin, one of the few from a humble background. He had always kept a low profile and rarely had the opportunity to meet one of his clan's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. He bowed before the Daoist Master and said respectfully:

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, someone from the lake has arrived!"

Behind him followed a woman, dressed as a married lady. Her cultivation was extremely dense; she practiced the rare Blazing Fire and was already at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, yet she was very young. The moment Li Jiangqian saw her, he immediately raised his eyebrows. While dismissing the others, he smiled and said:

"Greetings, Aunt!"

Xia Shouyu managed the clan's spiritual qi; there were very few matters that would require her to come here personally. The young man had a guess almost instantly. Sure enough, he saw the woman say in a low voice:

"Daoist Master, the people from the south have returned."

She lifted her sleeve, took out a box that looked like black jade, and handed it to the Daoist Master, saying with a serious expression:

"The spiritual qi is complete!"

A smile appeared on Li Jiangqian's face as he took the item. A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed a field of yang malice within, interwoven with gold and white, carrying a magnificent aura. It was precisely the Imperial Sun-March Sha gathered from Yi Mountain City!

'It takes some time for it to be sent from the south, but this is even faster than I thought!'

He nodded in satisfaction, put the item into his sleeve, and said:

"Thank you for your trouble!"

"I wouldn't dare."

Now that the great desert formation was established, Xia Shouyu, who cultivated Blazing Fire, was well-suited to be here. The Li clan had thoughts of putting her in charge of a region, so she had been very busy these days. She immediately cupped her hands and retreated, leaving only Li Jiangqian standing on the high platform.

He paced a few steps with his hands behind his back and finally saw a streak of flowing light speeding toward him. It landed steadily on the formation's profound platform, manifesting a woman's figure. He breathed a sigh of relief and stepped forward.

"How did it go?"

Li Que'wan was half-pleased, half-worried, looking preoccupied with heavy thoughts. She said:

"I've obtained the cultivation art… but… there is some news, and this is not the place to talk—where is Senior Liu?"

Hearing her mention Liu Changdie, Li Jiangqian had a faint inkling, and said:

"He is on the lake, accompanying the old master."

The two then flew up swiftly, crossing the lake and soon arriving at Gardenia Scenery Mountain. After sending someone to invite Liu Changdie, Li Que'wan hesitated several times before finally taking out a jade slip and a jade bottle, placing them silently on the table.

Li Jiangqian's spiritual sense descended, and the name of the cultivation art flooded his mind.

The Dao Qian Harmonising Oneness Scripture!

'A Harmonising Metal cultivation art, rare in this age!'

Having read only the outline, he already knew exactly what was about to happen. There was no need to look at the jade bottle on the table—it surely contained the spiritual qi for the Harmonising Metal art.

A trace of gloom flashed in the young man's eyes, yet there was also a sense of it being within reason. He said:

"Is this the will of the Golden Oneness?"

Liu Changdie might not be kind to others, but he was exceptionally good to Li Que'wan, giving her meticulous guidance and preparing congratulatory gifts. For the woman to return with such news felt like a knife twisting in her heart. Her expression was downcast as she replied:

"From their mouths, it is their goodwill. But their family has always been skillful manipulators. Whether it truly is… only they would know!"

Although the young man's eyes held some gloom, he shook his head decisively.

"If they were merely wary, they wouldn't need to use such a method. They could scheme Senior Liu to death with less effort than plucking a hair. Why do something so thankless? Since they laid it all out, there is at least seventy percent truth to it."

By the time the senior floated up to the mountain, the siblings had already brewed tea. Liu Changdie appeared to be in a good mood, the silver in the center of his brow faintly shimmering, his eyes filled with a smile.

"Que'wan is back!"

Li Que'wan suppressed her emotions and said politely:

"Indeed… I just returned from the Golden Feather Sect and obtained some news that I must discuss with Senior…"

"The Golden Feather Sect?"

Hearing these words, Liu Changdie already understood. His heart was filled with a deep vigilance and hatred for these great Daoist traditions. The smile on his face gradually faded and changed, a hint of coldness appearing in his eyes as he said:

"Are they here to kill me… or to tell me to take my own life?"
