# Chapter 710: The Baijiang Creek Territory

Li Ximing understood the moment Yuan Fuyao finished his tale.

‘The wilderness is the territory of the Xiao and Kong families, and my clan is about to establish a presence there. He must have become a topic of conversation, a potential gift for someone to capture and present to us for favor. After the Si family destroyed the Song clan, his own bloodline fell into their hands. Finding him was only a matter of if they wanted to, not if they could.’

‘Coming to my family was his only real chance to save his life and fortune. A clever move.’

Though Yuan Fuyao was a coward, his father, Yuan Chengdun, had been a true hero. He had slain demons, earned a great name for himself, saved countless lives during the demonic calamity, and shared a bond with Li Yuanjiao. The Li family had long ago promised that even if the marriage alliance fell through, they would still look after Yuan Fuyao. Despite the disgrace Yuan Fuyao had brought upon himself, the Li family, out of respect for his father’s memory, would never truly harm him. Using him as an example of their magnanimity was the more logical path.

Yuan Fuyao had almost certainly realized this, which gave him the courage to make the journey. The man had some cunning. He even knew to seek out the Clan Head, Li Zhouwei, first, preventing any lesser members from capturing him for their own gain.

With Li Ximing seated to the side, Li Zhouwei naturally refrained from taking the main seat. He stood by, silent, but the cold glint in his eyes made it clear that he, too, saw through the entire affair. Li Ximing took a sip of tea and said softly, “You overstate things. My family has no interest in settling scores with you. Chenghuai, escort the young master back to the Mushroom Forest Plains.”

“Yes, Daoist Master,” Li Chenghuai replied respectfully.

Without another word, he moved to Yuan Fuyao’s side. As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, a simple touch was enough to immobilize the man. Li Chenghuai had known Yuan Fuyao since they were young, and he couldn’t help but sigh inwardly as he dragged him away.

Li Ximing sat with the teacup in his hands, a long silence stretching before he finally spoke. “Yuan Chengdun was a hero of his time, yet his son is no better than a rat in a temple—useless, surviving only by the grace of his station. Talent is one thing, but to be so shortsighted and utterly dependent on his inheritance… The matter of heirs is truly unpredictable.”

The words were laden with meaning. Li Zhouwei could only offer a quiet reply. “Yuan Fuyao has a certain quick-wittedness, but he was spoiled by the Yuan family. He’s clever, but he was allowed to drift through his youth, so his ambitions are small. Even a fool, if guided and mentored daily, can be shaped into something useful.”

Li Ximing waved a hand, dismissing the topic. He produced a jade box from his sleeve. “Enough of that. I received a Horn Wood Golden Tassel at the Sword Gate. Take it and use it to nourish the Wanling Flower.”

“The matter of transplanting the Wanling Flower has not yet been settled,” Li Zhouwei noted. “Is it…?”

Only then did Li Ximing understand. The Wanling Flower had been planted on Mount Huqian for years. In the Li family’s early days, the mountain was considered adequate, but now it was a spiritually barren land. Moreover, its location by the lake was no longer secure. It was time to move it to the main island.

“Then let’s wait. The Wanling Flower is too precious to be moved carelessly. I was just thinking of visiting Changxi; I’ll discuss it with him as well.”

Having concluded his clan business, Li Ximing vanished into the Great Void. Li Zhouwei remained in the hall for a few moments before taking the main seat. He picked up his vermillion brush and issued a command.

“Have the Peak Administrator come here at once.”

This “Peak Administrator” was the Qi Refinement cultivator who had guided Yuan Fuyao to the island. He was Li Hun’s father, Li Anshuo. He should have been named Li Jiangshuo according to his generation, but his poor talent had denied him a place on the island when he was young. He had grown up on the outside, so he was more accustomed to his birth name. He currently served as an administrator for one of the prefectures on the western shore.

An attendant bowed and hurried out. A minute later, a man entered and prostrated himself in the hall. Without looking up, Li Zhouwei asked, “What did you receive in return?”

Li Anshuo remained on the floor. “Reporting to the Clan Head, Yuan Fuyao offered a staff technique to the clan. It was handed over to the island authorities upon his arrival.”

“Cautious, I see. It must be Yuan Chengdun’s staff technique, then. No wonder you were willing to take such a risk to personally introduce him.” Li Zhouwei made a mark on a scroll, showing no sign of anger. “Yuan Fuyao isn’t a fool, either. I imagine the scroll didn’t specify the technique’s grade… all the better to reduce your own liability.”

The two statements left Li Anshuo drenched in a cold sweat. “The Clan Head’s insight is profound. The Yuan family wrote it themselves, so it was not graded.”

“Sit.”

Li Zhouwei gestured for him to take a seat to the side before finally looking up. Li Anshuo couldn’t meet his gaze.

“Don’t direct your scheming at the island,” Li Zhouwei said casually. “Since you have such an ambitious mind, you’ll accompany me to the eastern shore tomorrow. There will be plenty of opportunities for you to scheme there.”

“If you perform well, you will be rewarded. If you fail, I will settle today’s matter with you then and there.”

Li Anshuo was both shocked and overjoyed. He hurriedly expressed his thanks, his face beaming with confidence. It seemed that years as a minor administrator by the lake had been a waste of his talents. Li Zhouwei waved him away.

“You may go. Second Brother is waiting for you in the side hall.”

The words wiped the smile from Li Anshuo’s face. He froze for a second before hastily retreating. As he left, Li Zhouwei sent someone to retrieve Yuan Chengdun’s staff technique and rubbed his temples.

‘This Li Anshuo… he might be useful.’

The Li family was currently facing a severe shortage of talent. The handful of Foundation Establishment guest elders had eased the pressure at that level, but there was a gaping hole in the ranks of Qi Refinement cultivators. Eighty percent of the Chengming generation had died on the riverbanks, and the Zhouxing generation was lackluster. The four vassal families of Lijing, their pillars for a century, had been crippled, and the eastern and western shores had yet to recover their strength. All the while, the family’s own enterprises were expanding faster than ever.

“Clan Head.”

Li Zhouwei looked up to see Li Chenghuai glide into the hall like a phantom. He presented a jade scroll. “A message from the Fei family has arrived,” he reported in a low voice. “There are two pieces of news.”

Li Zhouwei took the scroll containing the staff technique and began to read it as Li Chenghuai continued.

“First, the Fei family’s old patriarch, Fei Tongyu, passed away a few days ago. He died attempting to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. He had only been in seclusion for a few months, and there were no major phenomena.”

“Old men… they can be stubborn.”

With Fei Tongyu’s broken body and shallow cultivation, attempting a breakthrough was a death sentence. It was a foregone conclusion. Fei Qingyi had sent several letters in an attempt to dissuade him, but the old man would not be moved. His death was like a single grain of sand, causing a small ripple in the Fei family that had already dissipated by the time the news reached the lake.

Li Chenghuai didn't dwell on it. “The Fei family’s Fei Qingyi has broken through to the late stage of Qi Refinement. She has left Cold Cloud Peak and is waiting on the island, hoping to serve the clan.”

With his pressing need for manpower, Li Zhouwei simply nodded. “He’ll go to Jiangbei with the others.”

Li Chenghuai withdrew. By then, Li Zhouwei had finished a rough scan of the jade scroll. Yuan Chengdun was truly a genius. The *Green Mountain Demon-Subduing Staff* technique was likely a fourth-grade art, valuable enough to serve as the core inheritance for an ordinary cultivator family.

***

The Great River was the world’s artery, flowing from west to east and dividing the land into north and south. Across the river lay Jiangbei, the northern territory of the State of Xu. The first domain one encountered was the Baijiang Creek territory, controlled by the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion from Xiaoshi Mountain.

Li Chenghui flew on a bolt of lightning above Baijiang Creek, surveying the land. To the north lay the Tangdao Mountains, the domain of the Golden Tang Gate; he could faintly make out its rolling peaks. To the east was the Baiye Creek territory of the White Ye Immortal Sect, obscured by a vast expanse of hills. Beyond Baiye Creek was Chengshui Marsh, and further east still, bordering the sea, was the Baihai Creek territory of Xuanmiao Temple.

If one flew higher, they would see that Jiangbei was trisected by three waterways: the Baijiang, Baiye, and Baihai. Old Man Qu had told him that these three creeks were once a single great river, the Huai. During the cataclysm when six commanderies sank into the sea, the Huai River had vanished, leaving only these three streams behind.

Li Chenghui, along with Qu Bushi and An Siwei, landed before the Floating Cloud Cave. The path was littered with debris. The population had been plundered, and the spirit rice fields had been utterly ruined, leaving nothing but bare earth.

They descended before the entrance of the sect, which was situated on a low mountain. The protective array had been shattered long ago, and collapsed masonry was strewn everywhere. A few low-level rabbits and mice scurried through the dilapidated courtyards. Qu Bushi led the way with a practiced air. “My lord, Fu Dou’s immortal foundation was ‘Wood Leaning on Spring.’ When he fell on this mountain, the flora erupted with life. It’s only been a few months, but it looks like decades have passed.”

An Siwei went to the summit and performed a quick divination. “Jiangbei is truly overflowing with spiritual energy,” he marveled. “No wonder every Foundation Establishment cultivator wants to come here. Even a small peak like this can support several of them…”

Aside from the Li family’s core territories—the dense forest, Gardenia Scenery Mountain, and Pingya Island, which could support a Purple Mansion cultivator—the number of their lands that could sustain multiple Foundation Establishment cultivators could be counted on one hand. This place had neither high peaks nor deep earth-veins, yet it was remarkably rich.

“Protector, the Floating Cloud Cave territory has plenty of spirit fields,” Qu Bushi explained, “but it’s mostly hills. You won’t find a single tall mountain. The Foundation Establishment cultivators were scattered across the low peaks… even the main peak had few residents.”

Li Chenghui was aware of this. Floating Cloud Cave had been less of a centralized sect and more of a loose alliance of Foundation Establishment cultivators. They were large but hollow, each with their own agenda, which was why they had been powerless against Li Zhouwei. It was also why, when their doom was sealed, they had turned on Fu Dou to fight over his spoils.

“They divided the spoils and fled for their lives. At least they left the place clean.”

Li Chenghui dispatched Qu Bushi to inspect the land and An Siwei to survey the various peaks. He sent his own cultivators to spread out and occupy the territory. The Floating Cloud domain was about the size of the Li family’s western shore, but it was desolate and empty of people, giving it a hollow, abandoned feel.

It took three days of hard work just to get the cultivators settled and have them begin repairing their new residences. With no local populace to manage, claiming the territory was a straightforward process. Another half day passed, and the Embryonic Breathing realm cultivators arrived—runners, farmers, and qi-gatherers, nearly a hundred of them. Li Chenghui assigned them to his Qi Refinement subordinates, and the entire Floating Cloud territory began to stir with life, finally showing the signs of a proper cultivator settlement.

Though not a master administrator, Li Chenghui was competent. It still took him nearly half a month to establish a basic framework. The rich spiritual energy of Jiangbei motivated his subordinates; had it been a barren land, the process would have taken several times longer.

Just as he was getting things in order, An Siwei returned on the wind. “There were traces of demonic beasts in nine locations,” he reported softly. “Six were minor demons, and the teams I sent have already driven them off. Two were at the late Qi Refinement level, which I dealt with myself. But one location appears to be the residence of a Demon General. I don’t know his background, so I sent an invitation. The response was that he is in seclusion.”

Li Chenghui summoned Qu Bushi. The old man lacked leadership experience, but his age and expertise in surveying spirit fields were invaluable, and his work was progressing steadily. Hearing An Siwei’s report, he waved a hand. “To inform the master of the house, there is a demon flood dragon in Baijiang Creek. He is of the dragon lineage and settled in the river long ago. I’ve heard that when a Dragon Prince passed through Baihai Creek, he sent a messenger to summon him for questioning. He’s not someone to be offended…”

“He has a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation and belongs to a noble species. He’s been ennobled as the Northern Brocade River King. His domain isn’t just Baijiang Creek; all three rivers are under his rule. He just prefers to live here because the water is clearer.”

“The one on the mountain is a snake demon, who took the River King as his adoptive father, which is why he acts so arrogantly. When Fu Dou was here… he had to send tribute every year.”

“So he really does have backing,” An Siwei murmured. Sending an invitation first had been the right move.

Li Chenghui nodded in agreement. As he was about to speak, a woman descended onto the peak. She wore a red dress patterned with True Fire and a golden sash around her waist. In her delicate hand, she held a golden brazier from which a flicker of reddish-white flame danced.

Li Chenghui rose and bowed with a smile. “Elder Sister, you’ve arrived.”

In her hand, Li Minggong held the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, and nestled within it was the fluffy, glowing Pure Feather Li-Fire. The mere presence of the flame was enough to incinerate the thorns along her path.

“I came ahead of the Clan Head,” she said with a smile. “He will be here shortly. I came to see if my brother has concluded matters at Floating Cloud Cave.”

“All that’s left is to pacify the local demon,” Li Chenghui replied, his brow furrowing. “If he’s in seclusion, then so be it. My family is a Purple Mansion clan; as long as we don’t bother each other, that should be enough. We don’t need his mountain. He can have it for his cultivation.”

“About that…” Qu Bushi, who had spent the last few days learning the ways of his new masters, interjected cautiously. “That snake demon is vicious. He never gave Fu Dou any respect and would demand a blood sacrifice every eighth month. It’s the ninth month now… I fear he woke up long ago.”

Li Chenghui understood the implication immediately. Even Li Minggong raised an eyebrow. “Oh?” Li Chenghui’s voice grew heavy. “So he simply doesn’t wish to see us?”

Li Minggong scoffed. “Whether he wishes to or not is irrelevant. With a Purple Mansion cultivator present, does he dare say another word?”

Though she spoke with disdain, she was laughing at the snake demon’s ignorance.

‘Never mind a distant relative of dragon-kind; our Clan Head has conversed with a Dragon Prince himself. But that involves the Fox and Dragon clans, so we cannot speak of it openly…’

When Li Zhouwei had his breakthrough, dragons had come to offer invitations and serpents had bowed in respect. The Li family, fearing that borrowing the dragons’ prestige would attract even greater enemies, had not spread the tale. Furthermore, with their great-aunt’s fate still unknown, they were even more reluctant to speak of it. But many of the older Purple Mansion cultivators in Jiangnan knew. Otherwise, no matter how Li Zhouwei had struggled, he never would have survived the last decade. He would have been killed long ago.

Li Chenghui knew this as well and was not concerned. “An invitation must still be sent,” he insisted. “We need to meet him at least once. My family plans to relocate our people here. If he goes mad one day and comes down the mountain looking for a blood sacrifice, there will be lives lost!”

His words were veiled. Whether the lives lost would be human or demon was left unsaid. Qu Bushi understood perfectly and smiled grimly. “Placating the Northern Brocade River King is what’s most important,” he advised diplomatically. “This snake demon is merely relying on him. I’m afraid Wenhu of Dense Cloud Cave has already made his move to win over the River King… which would put our clan in a difficult position…”
