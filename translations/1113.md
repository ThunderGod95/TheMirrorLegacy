# Chapter 1113 Heavenly Nurture

Ting Province.

Inside the magnificent great hall, the atmosphere was grim. Cultivators knelt across the floor below, while high above, a man in crimson robes paced with his hands clasped behind him. He listened to the reports from his subordinates, finally letting out a long sigh.

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had won a complete victory in the great battle, suffering no casualties. The situation on the west bank, however, was tragic. Li Jiangzong had been chained to this position for seven consecutive days, unable to rest for even a moment.

"Family Head... the Pu family's young head, Pu Xinya, has also returned..."

Li Jiangzong paused.

"Did he have anything to say?"

The man below shook his head.

"He collected the consolation payment, changed into white mourning robes, and went up the mountain."

The Pu clan had been diligent these past years. They had finally managed to produce a Family Head at the Foundation Establishment Realm, only for him to die in the battle. Although Pu Xinya had been assigned to a market far from home, the original purpose was to temper him. His talent was excellent, and he was a good friend of Li Suining. Li Jiangzong naturally looked out for him.

"This matter must also be told to Suining. It would be best if it came from him..."

He turned to ask, but another subordinate came forward to report.

"Young Master Ning is still on the mountain. His estate's gates are tightly sealed, and he has sent no word."

Li Suining was considered exceptionally hardworking among the clan. Having broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he was a pillar of his generation. Ordinarily, he would have been out and about helping at a time like this. It was the first time he had remained in seclusion for so long.

Li Jiangzong shook his head, slightly surprised.

"Then set it aside for now... You..."

Before he could say more, a series of reports came from outside, and a youth entered the hall.

The young man was dressed in military attire, cutting a heroic and dashing figure. He was born with a truly celestial appearance, his golden pupils shining, and he carried an air of exceptional martial prowess. He offered a salute and said formally,

"Greetings, Clan Uncle!"

A smile immediately bloomed in Li Jiangzong's eyes. He strode quickly down the steps, helped the young man up, and said,

"We are family. Why stand on ceremony!"

This person was King Wei's eldest grandson, the son of Li Jianglong—Li Suihuan!

As the genius of the Li clan's new generation, Li Suihuan's cultivation speed was terrifying. At only twenty-eight, he had already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. His cultivation base was faintly on par with Li Jiangzong himself, who stood on the high platform. His speed in reaching this realm was not only the fastest of all the clan branches but had even surpassed several of his uncles. He was second only to his grandfather, Li Zhouwei!

While this was certainly due to the blessing of his Bright Yang bloodline, it was more than enough to prove how astonishing the King Wei's grandson's talent truly was.

Li Jiangzong's eyes were filled with admiration. He watched as Li Suihuan smiled faintly, retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve, and presented it to his elder.

"The affairs of the west bank are settled. The land deeds have been redistributed, and all posts are functioning. Stability has been restored."

Li Jiangzong exclaimed in admiration. He dismissed everyone else and led Li Suihuan to the back hall to sit. He read the contents of the slip carefully, and after a long time, he sighed.

"Impressive."

This twenty-eight-year-old grandson had pacified the chaos and ruin of the entire west bank in just seven days. He had repaired the palaces, resumed operations at the spirit mines, and arranged guards for the immortal mountains. He was nothing like the royal scion one would expect to find cultivating in seclusion all day.

This made Li Jiangzong silently think of his own eldest son, currently imprisoned on Qingdu. He grew so angry his insides trembled. He gnashed his teeth and sighed,

"That monstrous beast... if he had even a fraction of your ability, I wouldn't have to keep him locked up!"

Li Suihuan returned the salute but replied with great solemnity,

"Brother Qing... his flaws are only a matter of his arrogant temperament."

Li Jiangzong merely took these as pleasantries. He shook his head, not paying it much mind.

Ever since Li Suiqing had committed that monstrous mistake, Li Jiangzong had given up all hope for him. He had only intervened to spare his life. Since then, he had taken a new concubine and diligently attended to his bedroom affairs. Only his own father, Zhoufang, still cared, occasionally visiting his grandson.

He dropped the subject, noticing that Li Suihuan's face still held a trace of joy. He smiled,

"What's this? You have good news?"

Li Suihuan laughed. "I received a letter from Father! I was wondering if Grandfather has returned?"

Smiling, he took the letter from his sleeve and handed it to Li Jiangzong. Li Jiangzong was slightly taken aback. He held the letter, not daring to read it. Only after Li Suihuan nodded did he open it and scan the contents.

Li Suihuan grinned.

"Father's concubine, who accompanied the army, has given birth to a daughter!"

"Oh?!" Li Jiangzong was instantly overjoyed. "How rare!"

The 'Sui' generation was not lacking in geniuses. Setting aside the royal scions, the brothers Li Suining and Li Suikuan were more than enough to support the generation. There were many others with excellent talent as well. The only regret was the imbalance of Yin and Yang—there were far too few women.

He read the letter, his face wreathed in smiles, but his heart held more than just joy. After so many years as Family Head, his sharp intuition made him ask,

"I wonder which wife it was?"

Li Suihuan gave an ambiguous smile.

"Mother has remained in the capital all these years. The few wives from the family who went along would naturally not accompany the army. The one in the camp was a gift from Lord Yang. She has no background, nor is her surname Yang. It is Huang."

"I heard she is a cultivator from a small clan in Yue State. Her father is traceable, enfeoffed as a minor official in the Dongli area... After this, I imagine he's due for a meteoric rise."

Li Jiangzong understood the implications and relaxed slightly. He felt much more satisfied.

"This is for the best."

Li Suihuan had already stood up, visibly excited.

"My little sister was born in Jianghuai, just as the old year was bidding farewell. Father thought of it long ago and chose the character 'Sui' for her name. He sent this letter back to report the happy news to Grandfather!"

Li Jiangzong nodded repeatedly. He held the letter as if it were a priceless treasure and smiled.

"Let's go! We must see the Old Master at once!"

...

The Heavenly Light was brilliant.

Li Ximing stood up on the mountainside, pacing twice on the white jade-like ground. A small, bird-like wisp of Radiant Fire circled him once before landing on his shoulder. The Daoist Master's face was contemplative.

After a long moment, he said, "I... truly did not expect the Song Emperor to hold such views regarding the Underworld."

Li Zhouwei stood with his hands behind his back.

"The dissatisfaction in his heart runs even deeper than this junior imagined. After all, no matter how you look at it, the Underworld is determined to see him succeed. Yet, judging by his attitude, he is completely displeased by it."

Li Ximing's brow was tightly furrowed. He looked up after a good while.

"From his demeanor, how much of what he said was true?"

King Wei paused, then shook his head.

"It did not seem false, nor would there be a reason for falsehood. There must be a subtle rift between Yang Zhuo and the Underworld."

Li Ximing looked as if he wanted to say something, but he stopped as Li Zhouwei continued thoughtfully, "Unless... Yang Zhuo himself is unsatisfied with his future path of attaining the Dao. Or perhaps... even for an entity as powerful as the Underworld, possessing the Metallic Essence of True Monarch Tianwu... the True Qi they've obtained by using the entire world as a chessboard... Yang Zhuo is not satisfied with it."

"Is this a disagreement between Yang Zhuo and the Underworld, or between Tianwu and the Underworld? And what exactly is the relationship between Yang Zhuo himself and the Tianwu Metallic Essence?"

Li Ximing pondered this for a long time, finding the perspective refreshing.

"You mean... his emphasis that an Imperial Monarch cannot be subservient, and his point that Tianwu styled himself a True Monarch, not an Imperial Monarch... was a hint? That his conflict with the Underworld isn't about status... but some other problem? Perhaps he feels they are stunting his growth, or... perhaps it's an old grudge from his time as Tianwu?"

He mulled this over, then asked tentatively, "Did the Underworld... play a disgraceful role in the destruction of the Ning and Chu states, both of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition?"

Li Zhouwei said quietly, "Wei is also Encompassing Profoundity."

This silenced Li Ximing. He raised his eyebrows in dawning realization.

"Wei and Chu are known as the Southern and Northern Dynasties. If both originated from Encompassing Profoundity... does that mean the entire mortal realm falls under this single Profoundity? That is... formidable indeed."

Li Zhouwei hesitated for a moment before replying, "It is too early to be certain of these things. But I can see that Yang Zhuo is ambitious. He will uncover the truth sooner or later. This junior is more concerned with another matter."

"This Underworld, and this Luoxia... if they want to elevate a True Monarch, what are their chances of success? How difficult would it be to control a True Monarch? And what methods do they possess to make a True Monarch fall?"

He pressed his hand against his cup.

"It is the same path of attaining the Dao. Why did Emperor Zhao fall so suddenly? When the Metallic Essence of a deceased True Monarch or Immortal attains the Dao again, how does it differ from a successor ascending to that position?"

"In other words, when Jade True attained the Dao all those years ago and managed to retreat completely unharmed... was it because they had the ability and qualifications to do so? Or was it because... the great powers above _needed_ someone to occupy the Jade True position?"

Li Zhouwei paced two steps.

"These answers have been extinguished by history. Besides a few great, renowned powers, only those ancient, powerful clans would know. The Touba, the Shilou, and perhaps the Tao, Wei, and Qi... Once we fight our way into Luoxia, and our cultivation is higher, we should be able to find some answers."

Li Ximing nodded, musing, "In any case, this can be considered a good thing. As long as the Song Emperor stands with you, you won't have to watch your back. The northern expedition will be far more peaceful, and you will have a proper chance to seek your own opportunities."

The two sorted through their gains. Li Zhouwei then took the Spiritual Treasure, the Heavenly Nurture Urn, from his sleeve. He placed it before Li Ximing with a smile.

"He was certainly generous, though."

The item was a gift from the Song Emperor and was naturally ownerless. Li Zhouwei had refined it in the short time since his return. It was the same small, brown urn, but it now showed faint, golden, vertical veins that looked like wood grain. Inside, dark grains of rice rolled slightly with the movement, each one possessing the texture of a gemstone.

Li Ximing took it from his hand, and the mystical connection transferred. A feeling of a blood-link instantly spread from his palm. He tilted the urn slightly, hearing the faint _clinking_ of the gem-like grains colliding inside, but nothing would pour out. He then spotted a line of characters on the urn's bottom:

【My Spirit Resides in the Marsh】.

This Heavenly Nurture Urn, whose Dao Lineage the Song Emperor claimed was extinguished, possessed a full four wondrous abilities!

The main divine ability was Store and Combine. It was described as: The people gather, the people receive, beginning from me; the people pick, the people carry, reaching where I be. With a thought, the urn's mouth would release ten thousand rays of binding light. It could not collect lightning, fire, or Metal Malice, but all other things would be drawn in, unable to resist. This was especially true for anything of water-virtue; it would rush in, never to return.

This collection ability was different from ordinary mystical arts. It could take not only inanimate objects, but also light, illusions, wavering blessings, and even living beings.

A thought stirred in Li Ximing's mind. He saw Li Zhouwei smile.

"If Buddhist cultivators run into this, they're in for a rough time. Especially those of the Compassion Dao... they love establishing their little Buddhist Lands and releasing their Dharma Protectors. If they run into this Spiritual Treasure, Maha might be fine, but Merciful One would probably have all their spell arts crippled. Any spirit bodies they summon would just float powerlessly and fall."

"This junior tested it briefly. I estimate that if you could beat Merciful One half to death, you could collect them inside. They would be unable to call to heaven or appeal to earth. While it's not as good as the Huai River Map in that regard, it's still a wondrous method!"

Li Ximing nodded slowly, then said suddenly, "In that case, this treasure would also be very useful against the 'Upper Shaman' and the 'Xiukui'."

He replied casually, continuing his study of the treasure. The secondary mystical ability was called Bright Alignment, and it was equally peculiar.

This so-called Bright Alignment was quite similar to the Renew ability of the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron from Li Ximing's own 'Gathering Wood' Dao Lineage.

Renew allowed injured spirit plants within the cauldron to recover slowly by gathering spiritual items. Bright Alignment, however, allowed the Heavenly Nurture Urn to hold a massive amount of spiritual resources, which would, over time, condense into a wisp of Sacrificial Millet Earth.

This Sacrificial Millet Earth was nurtured within the urn and served as its core spirit. Its nature was aligned with 'Horn Wood' and 'Treasured Earth'. It could nourish spirit roots, sense them, and complete their life-mandate!

Beyond that, there was another ability used to preserve a life-mandate, called Preservation. Its requirements were strange: it could only be used on a 'guest', not the 'host'. If a cultivator suffered grievous injuries and their Dharma body was collapsing, the Spiritual Treasure's owner could draw them into the urn to temporarily stabilize them.

However, if the owner _themself_ was injured, this ability could not be used at all—unless another person took possession of the Spiritual Treasure and became its new owner.

The final wondrous ability was called Grand Sacrifice. It was much rarer and was used for sacrifice to seize blood-qi. By using Grand Sacrifice to collect three or four hundred cultivators, one could nurture their blood-qi to heal wounds or nourish other items.

This made Li Ximing feel slightly uneasy. A thought quickly turned in his mind.

'Looking at this ability's performance... if it's combined with the first divine ability, 【Store and Combine】... one could theoretically collect a heavily injured Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, strip them of their divine abilities, and refine their essence...'

Pondering this, he couldn't help but give a bitter laugh.

"'Upper Shaman' are barbaric, and 'Xiukui' are grotesque. It's not surprising they would have a Spiritual Treasure like this."

Li Zhouwei knew what he was referring to. He shook his head.

"I don't believe this item belonged to the Underworld originally."

He didn't dwell on the matter, instead smiling.

"I believe this Spiritual Treasure's main power is in Store and Combine, but its most wondrous aspect is Bright Alignment!"

Li Ximing mused for a moment, and understanding dawned. His eyes lit up.

"You mean... that spirit root?!"

Li Zhouwei nodded with a smile.

"Purple Mansion Realm spirit roots are incredibly rare. When the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven found one, it immediately fell into the Golden Feather Sect's hands. As for Foundation Establishment Realm spirit roots, our family doesn't lack for them. But... setting aside cultivation level, a spirit cultivator that has awakened its own sentience... don't we have one of those right here?"

Years ago, when Li Qinghong was traveling, she found a spirit root persimmon tree in Jiangnan that had gained spirituality. Such spirit cultivators are exceedingly rare and take a thousand years to mature, so its cultivation base is extremely low. After being moved to the clan, it has only served to provide the younger generation with an occasional spirit persimmon to taste.

"But with this Spiritual Treasure, the situation is entirely different."

Li Ximing studied the faintly glowing treasure in his hands, growing fonder of it by the moment. He nodded repeatedly in praise.

"Our family has no shortage of spirit rice and other resources. Even if the quality is low, we can easily make up for it with quantity. It's no great loss to use a lot! We will first spend half a year nurturing this Sacrificial Millet Earth."

"This so-called Sacrificial Millet Earth that 'completes the life-mandate'... when it encounters a sentient spirit root, I imagine it will produce a truly unique wonder!"

Li Zhouwei smiled and replied, "I will have to trouble Grand-Uncle with this matter. I am going to select my spell arts and enter seclusion immediately."
