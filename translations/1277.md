# Chapter 1277: The Dao Clans

The Northern Sea was bitterly cold, with ice and snow stretching for miles, while Cangzhou was a treacherous land of surging black waters.

Yet in this deep and perilous land, two immortal mountains abruptly appeared—one high and one low, one to the left and one to the right. The taller peak resembled an ox's horn, while the shorter one looked like a small dog glancing back over its shoulder, their auras linked as a single, indivisible whole.

The sun had already sunk below the horizon, and the rainy, snow-filled sky was tinged with color, a faint evening glow still visible. Upon the high mountain sat a single lake, black as ink. Snow dusted the ground, where a solitary fishing rod of pure jade was propped up. Beside it, a green stone piled high with ice and snow held a black-covered book.

Where a person should have been sitting was only a cattail cushion, with no one in sight. The old man had left his seat and was now leaning against the base of the green stone, draped in a coir raincoat. In a rare gesture, he had untied his conical hat, revealing a white hair bun dusted with falling snow.

His two hands, old and mottled, were busy weaving a new bamboo hat. The old man's fingers were remarkably nimble; he held the body of the hat with three fingers, used his thumb to flip up a bamboo slat, and with a gentle extension of his index finger, threaded a bamboo leaf from between his knuckles through the frame. In just a moment, he had woven both brims to be perfectly sealed.

"Senior Xiao!"

A clear voice cut through the bleak, cold wind as an azure light, like polished jade, descended. A young man's laugh followed.

"Senior Xiao, there's been trouble in Xiang."

The old man folded a bamboo leaf and tucked it under the hat's base, creating a perfectly round and pleasing brim. Only then did a smile touch his lips. He tossed the remarkably light bamboo hat in the air, caught it between two fingers, and held it up to inspect against the evening glow in the cold snow, speaking softly.

"It's about Luoxia, isn't it?"

A young man in white robes then walked out from the rain and snow. His features were handsome, his eyes held a smile, and after offering a salute, he said,

"Precisely."

The old man continued to examine the bamboo hat in his hands—it was woven so tightly that not a single gap could be seen. Holding it before him, the light of the evening sky could not penetrate it, casting only a round, black shadow on his body that gradually elongated with the setting sun.

After the young man spoke, he stood quietly by his side, listening as the old man chuckled.

"Sect Master Nian didn't tell me, which means he wanted me to guess."

The young man shook his head with a laugh and replied,

"I've already figured out most of it, to say nothing of you, Senior Xiao. It was King Wei, of course—he cut down some unknown mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator as easily as slaughtering a chicken."

Senior Xiao said faintly, "The Yang Clan and the Song Emperor will naturally support him. They would be delighted to see as many immortals elevated as possible. They were even counting on Sima Boxiu's breakthrough back then, but that stubborn old wood refused to compromise and chose to risk everything instead."

The young man nodded.

"If he had compromised a little, he could have held on until the founding of the nation and brought glory to the Yang Clan. A pity... since he had already arranged his affairs, he was ultimately bent on seeking the Dao, and he rightly predicted that the Yang Clan couldn't hold it against him."

"The Underworld doesn't bear the Yang name, after all."

The sun had now dipped below the horizon, the evening glow dissipated, and a bright moon began its slow ascent. The rain and snow ceased for a moment. Only then did Xiao Chuting put on his bamboo hat, stand up, and pat the snow from his clothes.

"Sect Master Nian, your divine ability has progressed. I'm afraid Qing Zhuo is likely no longer your match."

Hearing this, the Daoist Master just shook his head and smiled.

"He and I are evenly matched. It's just that my True Monarch has achieved his ascension, and the grace has extended to me. If I were placed on Mount Changhuai, I might not fare any better than him."

At this moment, a profound look entered his eyes, and he said with a wry smile,

"Besides, there's no point in comparing these things. Whether it's me or him, the chances of attaining a position are not high. Sometimes, outsiders envy us, but we, in turn, envy them."

"Just like you, Senior Xiao. As long as you can stand at the peak of this world's turbulent waves, you can reach out and touch the clouds. The opportunity for Fruition Attainment will be yours. Those of us seeking auxiliary or intercalary positions can only gaze up from the ground."

Xiao Chuting had already turned around and said quietly,

"Daoist Friend Nian Yi... over these past thirty years, you and I can be said to have formed a friendship. As I prepare to head to the mainland, do you have any advice for me?"

His tone had become very solemn, formally using the address "Daoist Friend." Nian Yi also set aside his smile, his expression growing serious as he said in a low voice,

"I wouldn't dare call it advice."

He continued, "Senior, your divine ability is now restrained, and I cannot see it clearly, so I cannot guess. However, Pit Water is a primary position, and the intercalary path is difficult to walk. Fortunately, auxiliar is an option. You needn't consider Converging Water or Pristine Water; there are but three paths before you."

He held up three fingers and sighed.

"Cultivate Pit Water to enter the true fruition, or retreat to a deviant auxiliary. If you take neither of those two paths, perhaps you could try Valley Water."

Nian Yi turned to look at him. Xiao Chuting gave a wry smile.

"I am not willing to follow Sima Boxiu's example, nor am I qualified to."

A light began to shine in Nian Yi's eyes as he said,

"Senior has a true fruition to cultivate? Could it be... that True Monarch..."

Xiao Chuting began to laugh again but did not elaborate. His voice was hoarse.

"Perhaps it's worth a try."

Nian Yi pondered for a moment before saying, "When the True Monarch achieved the Dao back then, he fought beyond the heavens at the Dao Manifestation Ruins and only returned after many years. His responses have become less frequent. I paid a visit to Profound Truth Mountain and received one or two revelations myself."

Nian Yi's gaze was burning as he said, "Although this junior doesn't know what other trump cards or backing Senior Xiao possesses... or whether you came to the Northern Sea because of the one in Cangzhou, if Senior Xiao can obtain Pit Water, the Profound Chaos Dark World Feng Yue True Monarch will certainly be exceedingly pleased..."

"Cultivation Transcendence True Monarch..."

Xiao Chuting showed no surprise.

"This old man is not the one from Golden Oneness, nor do I have the capital for another life. If I were to obtain'Pit Water, I would have to commit excesses to pacify the dragons. Daoist Friend Nian need not mention it again."

His gaze rested quietly on the young man.

"Daoist Friend Nian should also know that I am not asking about the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition."

Nian Yi stood with his hands behind his back, a hesitant look in his eyes.

"This junior believes that besides the one in Cangzhou, there must be others. If Senior Xiao is willing to inform this junior... who is willing to act on your behalf, Nian Yi will naturally hold nothing back and explain everything."

The old Daoist Master stepped forward, looking down at the ink-black lake water.

"Impossible."

The moonlight was clear, and the mountain fell silent for a moment. A slight change came over Nian Yi's expression, and he said softly,

"In that case, forgive this junior for being unable to comply."

The old man gave a hoarse laugh.

"Forgive me for not seeing you off."

Nian Yi looked deeply at the old man before him, not moving. The Xiao family Daoist Master had already walked to the lake's edge and lifted the fishing rod, saying casually,

"In my early years, I was constrained by the times. To protect my clan, I had to spend my days refining pills and managing affairs. Later, I suppressed the various families of Tiaoyun, reclaimed Mount Yu, and planted the Wu Clan as a pawn. By the time I achieved the Dao, I was already three hundred years old, having walked step by step to this day."

"Whether these great figures in the heavens support me or not, the situation is already set. Does anyone think that just because they despise my ascension, I will simply not seek verification? That's naturally impossible."

There was no tension or anxiety in his eyes, only a frank acceptance. He smiled faintly and said,

"Since I will seek verification whether they support me or not, it makes no real difference whether they know. It's just something new for them to hear, a chance to be mentally prepared. Even if Xueyang is waiting for me in Badger Prefecture, I will go regardless."

Nian Yi remained silent. He too was a man with aspirations of verifying the Dao. Facing Xiao Chuting, he truly felt a desire to see him succeed, and only said in a low voice,

"Since the Daoist Master has made his decision, I have nothing more to say. Out of our private friendship, I will not hold back anything I can share."

His eyes burned brightly, and he hesitated for a long time before organizing his words.

"The ones on the mountain will not be pleased to see the Water Virtue primary position claimed. A single Dui Metal has already caused them such a headache... moreover... Daoist Master Xiao must surely understand himself that you have never been one to follow the rules!"

He didn't mention which mountain he meant, but whenever one spoke of "the mountain," Xiao Chuting understood instantly. He let out a rare, hearty laugh.

"You didn't mention the host of dragons first. Could it be they fear my ascension even more than the Dragon-kin?"

Nian Yi gave a very slight nod.

A look of gradual understanding appeared in Xiao Chuting's eyes, yet he seemed keenly interested. He stirred the lake's surface with the jade-like fishing rod.

Nian Yi paused for a moment, then continued, "As for the south, they remain aloof as if it doesn't concern them. It's not that they are completely indifferent, but they have little interest, otherwise the Yang family wouldn't have the chance to make moves in private today."

He let out a low sigh, then seemed to feel he had said too much and added with a smile,

"Of course—none of them believe you can succeed. They are all just watching coldly from the sidelines."

Xiao Chuting raised his brows to look at the moonlight but ultimately said nothing. The young man stood with him by the lake for a long, long time. Seeing that the night was about to pass and the morning glow would soon rise, he raised his hand to bid farewell.

He walked all the way to the edge of the great array before finally turning back, bowing as he said, "I wish Senior success in mastering the golden essence and vital breath, ascending to the position of a True Monarch. When that time comes and the primary position bears fruit, the whole world will know. This junior will certainly offer congratulations from Azure Jade Cliff and pray in reverence to the True Monarch."

Xiao Chuting nodded.

"I accept your auspicious words."

And so, the last trace of disturbance vanished. An unknown amount of time passed, the sun and moon cycling, before someone was seen coming up the mountain. The person approached and paid his respects, saying reverently,

"Greetings, Ancestor!"

This person's hair and beard were completely white, and he had a very kind appearance. He leaned on a wooden staff from which a medicine pouch dangled precariously. Kneeling in the snow, he said respectfully,

"Ancestor, a letter has arrived from the Li family."

Xiao Chuting stood up and turned to look at him, genuinely startled for a moment before saying,

"Yuansi, you've grown old too."

Xiao Chuting's tone had always been indifferent, like eternal black ice, calculating everything with perfect clarity. Even when using and scheming against Xiao Yuansi, he had been impassive, leaving him to realize the truth only long after.

But his current tone was a first, rendering Xiao Yuansi speechless and causing him to choke up.

Xiao Yuansi should have been immensely grateful to this Daoist Master who had saved the Xiao family from a life-or-death crisis and led them to their peak after breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Yet, he was simply too cold and ruthless. The deeds of the past had filled him with grief and regret—he knew, of course, that there was nothing he could do, but he would have rather died in some calamity than live on in compromise to this day.

Thus, facing Xiao Chuting, Xiao Yuansi's heart was a knot of complex emotions. As if understanding something, tears began to stream down his face.

"I only wish for the Ancestor's divine ability to be eternal."

Xiao Chuting chuckled and gently helped him up.

"How can any divine ability be eternal? Even a Golden Position would not dare claim permanence."

The old Daoist Master was in a rare, high-spirited mood.

"I know you still resent me. For all these years, you have been tossed about by worldly affairs, your heart filled with guilt over things you were prevented from accomplishing, mostly by me. Your current situation is a third my responsibility."

Xiao Yuansi wept.

"How could this junior harbor resentment? I understand the Daoist Master only acted to preserve my life!"

Xiao Chuting shook his head.

"In truth, among the many disciples in the family over the years, few have amounted to much. I was always most optimistic about you... I thought you could be a late bloomer like me, but alas... you are not as ruthless as Li Ximing."

The Alchemist kneeling before him choked out, "I am far from being Dao-achieving material!"

Xiao Chuting said with a scornful smile, "Correct. My methods are harsh. Yongling... I had Yongling cultivate the arts of Eastern Feather Mountain, which was really to get us away from Jiangnan. He was very driven, but ultimately fell short. If he had cultivated Water Virtue, he would have succeeded by now."

"And as for what you call 'preserving your life,' later on, that was merely to maintain our relationship with the Li family. It wasn't as noble as you think..."

Xiao Yuansi cried out, "That was also for the sake of the Xiao family!"

"You're wrong."

Xiao Chuting said faintly, "Do you know how Second Uncle fell?"

Xiao Yuansi's head snapped up, his pupils filled with shock.

Xiao Chuting's second uncle was Xiao Xianyou, indisputably the greatest genius in the history of the Xiao family. Not just Xiao Yuansi, but the entire family had been asking about the cause of his death for centuries!

At the mention of Xiao Xianyou, a fleeting complexity finally crossed Xiao Chuting's eyes.

"You all don't know, but I do. When he went to Cultivation Transcendence back then, he told only me. I never told the others. It was only later, after I reached the Purple Mansion Realm and asked Nian Yi, that I understood the full story."

"A genius like him, saddled with the infamy of having murdered his benefactor, actually believed Chi Wei's threats. He heard that the Yue Cultivating Sect was taking 'The Unsurpassed' to the grotto-heaven at Thundercloud Temple, that this item could discern one's heart and clear his name."

"I warned him: 'The Chi Clan is vicious and cannot be trusted.' But he replied, 'The Chi Clan may be wicked, but the Nian Clan is righteous. My conscience is clear. If I do not go, the rumors will spread, and the clan's reputation will be utterly destroyed, leaving us with no future.'"

"So he went overseas, never knowing that the Chi father and son had plotted it all out. The pills he received in exchange were actually blood elixirs. His heart was vindicated, but the dharma power throughout his body could not be, and he died without a sound under the light of 'The Unsurpassed.' It was only because Daoist Master Shang Miao remembered their old friendship that she suppressed the matter, and he was never heard from again."

"In truth, what the Xiao Clan needed was not for him to protect its reputation, but for him to achieve the Dao. He went off on his own, concerned only with his own path. If he hadn't gone to prove his innocence, who could have harmed him?"

Xiao Chuting said coldly, "I will not be like him."

"If it were for the Xiao family, the situation today would not be like this. Our Xiao family would have at least two Daoist Masters by now. We wouldn't have to shrink away at the corner of the world. Remaining in the Song court, if not basking in glory, we would at least be regional lords!"

"Yuansi, I am doing this for my own path."

The old man's face was calm as he said, "If I did not have the ambition to verify the Dao, perhaps your circumstances today would be entirely different. I would have exhausted my efforts, using all my divine ability to pave the way for you..."

"But I do have ambition. I have always been one to believe in myself. Rather than placing my hopes in your future success, I would rather believe that I can achieve the Dao and bring you all to glory with me."

He turned back.

"It was for my path that Yongling fell, and that Ruyu and Guitu wasted their time. Because if our Xiao family had even one more young Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it would have been impossible for me to sever my karma and escape. The only one who could leave was me."

"And you, who were left behind, would have become my burden."

Xiao Yuansi's gaze was vacant.

Xiao Chuting said quietly, "The so-called 'protecting the Xiao family' was merely a secondary option while I pursued my own cultivation. I can shelter you as much as possible. Following me, where could you not survive? But that is only for present success; it is absolutely not a future."

"There is no turning back on the path of seeking the Dao. I will not speak to you of the future."

Heavy, goose-feather snow began to fall. The old man in the coir raincoat stood with his hands behind his back, a smile in his voice.

"My path comes first, and you—second."

Xiao Yuansi stood there in a daze. He had followed this elder for over two hundred years, yet it felt as if only today did he truly understand him. The old man began to wail like a child, crying for a long time before stopping, his voice hoarse.

"I regret only that I was not born three hundred years earlier, to serve you and grant the Daoist Master the best of both worlds."
