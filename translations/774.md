# Chapter 774: The Flames Die

As the shout fell, the apricot-yellow light was still spreading, and fear had already taken root in the others. Daoist Zhuang held his Li Fire aloft. Seeing Li Zhouwei stand motionless with his halberd, he realized the man was recovering his breath. His heart seized, and he yelled:

"Act now! That Dharma Artifact he just used was no simple thing! He must be weak right now!"

His shout instantly steadied their resolve. The few of them exchanged a glance, urged their Dharma Artifacts forward, and instead of retreating, charged at the man before them.

Daoist Zhuang, meanwhile, formed a hand seal and cast a spell, standing still. With two fingers clasped, he moved his fire into his dantian, his heart filled with both fear and greed. In truth, Daoist Zhuang was not one of the original direct disciples of Changxiao Gate, but a late addition who didn't even have a Daoist name. He had no loyalty to Chengyan in the Great Void to speak of. But his eyes were sharp. In the raging Li Fire just now, he was the only one who saw that the opponent had used a Dharma Artifact.

'Such a powerful Li Fire artifact... it must be extraordinary... if I could get my hands on it...'

At that moment, Daoist Zhuang's killing intent was the strongest. Righteously, he had stabilized the morale of the group, while Li Zhouwei, for the first time, revealed a smile. He pushed his halberd sideways, bracing it with a clang against the Dharma Artifacts of two of them. Behind him, the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner rose once more.

The few cultivators engaged in combat again. As expected, after the intense battle, Li Zhouwei seemed to be running low on spiritual qi. The spiritual light from the sky descended once more, surprisingly pinning down the savage man again.

The battle below was fierce. In the sky, Baibin Zi had tears in his eyes and gritted his teeth. Area-of-effect Dharma Artifacts like the Yongjing Profound Ring were inherently taxing on the mind, and it was even more difficult for him to control the Dharma Artifact with his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation, making it hard for him to free his hands. But with his heart filled with grief and indignation, he no longer cared about whether a Daoist Master should intervene. His eyes bulging with fury, he poured all of his spiritual qi—even his essence—into the Dharma Artifact.

With this influx of spiritual qi, the Yongjing Profound Ring finally revealed its true might. The suppressive spiritual light grew thicker and thicker, gradually even pushing back the black flames on Li Zhouwei's halberd. He was increasingly put on the defensive, sustaining several injuries in a row.

Baibin Zi watched with elation, pouring even more spiritual qi into it. Who knew that a small gray brocade pouch at his waist would suddenly leap, and a talisman inside would activate with a pop, bursting into flames. Suddenly, a brilliant azure light shone forth, and a golden beam escaped from the top of Baibin Zi's head. He abruptly regained his clarity. His mind was blank for a moment, and his confusion quickly receded.

'Not good!'

Seeing the agitated state of the others below, he felt a chill crawl up his spine. Taking advantage of the talisman's effect before it faded, he struck the Yongjing Profound Ring with a palm. The spiritual light in the sky instantly shifted, and the Dharma Artifact reverted to its original form, falling into his hand. Baibin Zi's face was grim. He felt his entire body go soft and quickly formed a hand seal, descending.

When Li Zhouwei saw the spiritual light from the sky cease to fall, he understood that the other party had not fallen for it. A sense of pity arose in his heart. The halberd in his hand, however, suddenly changed. The raging black flames increased in power several times over, and the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light between his brows erupted again. Just as the old man was about to retreat, the Sun's Resonant Parting Art suddenly burst forth, transforming into several white beams that dragged him to a halt. In just that single moment's delay, the halberd descended with intense wind pressure.

*BOOM!*

The old man's hands were instantly shattered. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light flew over and punched a fist-sized hole in his head, flashing with flames. He was surely cooked inside.

'What a pity...'

The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was launched too hastily this time, its power far less than before. As the remaining few quickly retreated, Li Zhouwei did not give chase. Instead, he retracted his weapons and stood still in the air.

Baibin Zi descended on the wind. Daoist Zhuang, who was extremely displeased with Baibin Zi's sudden retraction of his Dharma Artifact, was about to lash out, when he saw Baibin Zi's cold expression and heard him say:

"The talisman from the Daoist Master worked! We were either deceived by fate just now, or deluded by a Divine Ability or Dharma Artifact. Retreat, now!"

When he said that, Daoist Zhuang felt a wave of cold rush to his head. He was horrified, thinking to himself:

'Why would I have craved his things!'

Baibin Zi took a few steps back, his heart ultimately filled with unwillingness. The original plan was not as simple as just the Yongjing Profound Ring. The Yongjing Profound Ring was a Dharma Artifact designed to destroy techniques and overturn profound formations. It was originally meant to deal with the vast number of cultivators and a dozen or so Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Li family, to break their formation at a critical moment and prevent Li Zhouwei's escape.

The real tool prepared for Li Zhouwei was the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope! That spiritual rope was for entangling and binding, restraining artifact combat. Coupled with the Yongjing Profound Ring, it would have left Li Zhouwei with no way to escape.

'Who knew... it would come to this!'

Gazing at Li Zhouwei, who stood steadfastly with his halberd, Baibin Zi's eyes slowly fell. His heart was bitter:

'This matter today... it's not just my Changxiao Gate, is it? More than one or two people want to harm Li Zhouwei.'

He could only keep these words in his heart, not daring to speak them aloud. The Yongjing Profound Ring in his hand glowed faintly, and his mouth trembled. In the end, he said nothing at all, and flew away on the wind.

The immortal cranes in the sky still wailed and circled within the raging Li Fire. Li Zhouwei propped up his halberd and slowly closed his eyes. The golden-eyed man wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth, and stepped, one foot at a time, from the air to the ground. A glint of moisture appeared at the corner of his eye, only to instantly evaporate and vanish on the scorching red Yuan'E Soft Armor.

The Great Void was a pitch-black expanse, undulating without cease. Yet, in one spot, a faint light shone, revealing a low table in the darkness. A middle-aged man in a Daoist robe sat cross-legged beside it. His hair and beard were half-white, and he appeared amiable. On his back, he carried a treasured sword with a Geng Metal scabbard, which emitted a brilliant light.

Across from this sword cultivator sat a man in brown clothes. He seemed somewhat simple and honest, waiting respectfully by his side, head bowed and silent, as if awaiting instructions.

"Senior Li... what do you think..."

Although the brown-robed man was respectful, his expression was troubled. He hesitated before speaking, and the sword cultivator across from him finally raised his brows, glanced at him, and replied:

"What is there to see?"

The brown-robed man immediately fell silent, sitting there feeling somewhat stifled. The sword cultivator lowered his brows and observed the Great Void for a moment. Only when the surrounding Purple Mansion cultivators had dispersed did he speak:

"Fellow Daoist Chengyan, I don't care how you throw your weight around on your own territory, but for you to run all the way to my Sword Gate's domain to act so brazenly, and to try and kill a descendant of one of our Sword Immortals, that's against the rules."

'Was that just me...?'

Chengyan's heart was bitter, but he replied aloud:

"This matter was my oversight. I originally wanted to invite this young friend to my Changxiao Gate for a visit, and to ask him for news of our Great Daoist Master. I didn't expect such a great conflict to erupt. It makes my sect look bad."

"It's true that this junior was imprudent. I apologize to you, Senior... please do not hold it against me."

Daoist Master Lingmei raised his brows, and the upward slant of his eyebrows immediately revealed their sharpness. The sword cultivator replied:

"Bullshit."
