# Chapter 1080: The Three Candidates

Diyan’s expression was calm as he silently watched Li Ximing.

With the Great Daoist Master's words laid out so plainly, Li Ximing finally took them to heart. With his own level of Dao-Profundity, he could not pick a single flaw in Diyan’s logic; in fact, the entire argument was flawlessly cohesive.

'He is fully focused on pursuing the leap. If Zhouwei succeeds, he will be standing in the ranks of the righteous Dao, perfectly integrated. If he fails, he will have sought the Dao through peril.'

Li Ximing paused for a moment of thought, then spoke,

"Since that is the case, Senior must have important matters to instruct me on, having invited me here multiple times."

"I dare not speak of 'instruction.'"

The currents of red and golden wind surging within the great hall instantly subsided. Diyan stepped forward and answered,

"Mount Qusi, situated overseas, has managed to survive until now primarily because it has little to do with the extermination of Bright Yang. The fact that the great ones in the heavens would tacitly allow me this meeting with you is also due to my ability to fan the flames of the Bright Yang affair..."

"Ultimately, it’s a good thing for them. I have only one matter to convey to the Emperor's Heir, that at present, Emperor Wei and I are walking the same path."

"This matter would be better discussed with Emperor Wei himself, but his White Qilin nature makes it unsuitable for him to enter this Hall of the Three Yangs Suppressing Dawn. I don't know when a meeting will be possible, so I need Your Highness to relay this."

Diyan's eyes moved slightly as he replied,

"If Emperor Wei is willing to trust me, I have three people for him to keep an eye on."

Li Ximing's expression turned solemn, but he dared not immediately agree. He simply replied,

"I will relay your message exactly as it was given."

Diyan raised an eyebrow. "First," he answered, "is the one favored by Western Lesser Yang, the emperor of the Xiangxiong Kingdom, and the master of the White Victory Dao who wields the Wind-Horse Profound Banner—Yin Lie. I was acquainted with him and we shared a friendship that lasted over a century."

"Although his White Victory Dao is a demonic path, it aspires to the Lesser Yang. When necessary, he will be an asset to Emperor Wei."

Diyan’s voice became much quieter.

"Western Lesser Yang and Luoxia are at odds, harboring astonishing enmity. Though they currently offer false submission, if there is a chance to obstruct Luoxia's grand affairs, Western Lesser Yang will not refuse."

Li Ximing’s expression darkened, a hint of surprise in his eyes. He hesitated for a moment and then said,

"My clan nearly clashed with the White Victory Dao—even now, though we haven't met, a friend of mine was injured by their people."

Diyan's look sharpened, and he gravely stepped forward, his voice turning somber.

"It's best to discard what can be discarded. Western Lesser Yang is keeping a low profile now; their past rampant activities are gone. They only act when absolutely necessary. Provoking them is deadly."

The strange sight of Fuxun's body instantly flashed through Li Ximing's mind, making him feel a fresh wave of fear. He remained silent. Diyan anxiously paced twice, eventually shaking his head and continuing,

---

"The second candidate is a figure from Great Shu, surnamed Shangguan, given name Mi. He is a junior acquaintance of my closest friend. Should a great war erupt between Shu and Song, if he falls into Emperor Wei's hands, please spare his life and have him serve Emperor Wei."

Li Ximing immediately looked up and solemnly stated,

"With the Great Daoist Master's sentiment... Ting Province will certainly..."

But before he could finish, Diyan interrupted with a wave of his hand.

"It is not just for my sake. The Shangguan family’s ancestors originated in Guanlong, one of the Six Clans. They were granted the title Luanfu and were loyal subjects of Wei, cultivating the Li Fire Dao. Leaving aside his own brilliant talent and profound Dao-Profundity at a young age, simply as a former official, Emperor Wei will gain great benefit if he can secure him."

Only then did Li Ximing understand, and he pressed the question.

"But when two nations are at war, with Martial Cultivation supreme, how can a single Daoist Master defect to the other side? Moreover, even if he is subdued in battle, his whole clan remains in his home country..."

"That is not difficult," Diyan said. "The Shangguan clan is in the Huayan Three Prefectures, west of Tongmo. Should the two nations eventually go to war and conquer that area, their entire clan can naturally be safeguarded. As for your mention of Martial Cultivation being supreme..."

A trace of a sarcastic smile touched Diyan’s lips.

"Martial Cultivation being supreme is correct, but who is the one with the True Qi? That is hard to say. Before that one with the True Qi achieves the Dao, the power of these two emperors is far less terrifying than you imagine."

Li Ximing tucked the warning into his memory, wisely choosing not to engage in such a vast topic. Diyan paused, then said somberly,

"There is one last person. He is my own junior, a direct descendant of the Yin family, named Yin Juexi. You met him just now."

Li Ximing immediately realized his meaning.

"Is that the one cultivating in front of the palace?"

Diyan nodded, speaking softly.

"Exactly. He has been cultivating for many years and is currently seeking a divine ability. Though I don't know the exact day he will emerge from seclusion, the time should be drawing near. He can serve as an attendant to Emperor Wei."

Li Ximing listened with a mix of complexity and emotion.

"He is far too great to be an attendant!"

Diyan turned to the side. "There is nothing Emperor Wei cannot live up to."

Li Ximing saw him fall silent, seemingly filled with melancholy and sorrow for a moment. He sighed and asked,

"Since Mount Qusi..."

Diyan shook his head. "It is I, not Mount Qusi."

Li Ximing stopped short. Diyan looked at the candle flame on the bronze lamp and spoke in a steady voice.

"When my ancestor, Yin Quan, was about to pass away, he left behind a few blood descendants with meager cultivation but carrying powerful Spiritual Treasures. Worrying about their fate, he traveled all the way to this Southern Sea and found a close friend, Patriarch Qujie. He entrusted his entire life-mandate, along with his bloodline, to him."

"Patriarch Qujie was a righteous Ancient Cultivator. He did not covet the many spiritual artifacts and treasures in the slightest, instead taking the descendants as disciples and instructing them carefully... It was only then that my family slowly continued its line and inherited this Mount Qusi."

Li Ximing understood immediately. As expected, Diyan's expression grew serious.

"The Yin family is the Yin family, and Qusi is Qusi. Mount Qusi holds not only the heart’s blood of three generations of my family but also the inheritance and grace of the ancestors of its Daoist Tradition. It cannot be lightly cast aside... A person like Kuang Yu, who is a recognized successor on Mount Qusi's register, has a different status entirely."

The matter was not difficult to grasp. Li Ximing repeatedly offered his apologies for his misassumption.

'No wonder... the cultivators of Qusi have always maintained a certain distance, only inviting me here to see Diyan. Ultimately, the affair concerning Bright Yang is a private matter for the Great Daoist Master. Not only is it completely unrelated to the Daoist Tradition itself, but it is also highly likely to bring danger...'

'The disciples of Mount Qusi show no resentment and are quite supportive, likely due to the Great Daoist Master's extremely high prestige...'

All his doubts connected and were instantly resolved. Li Ximing immediately understood why Mount Jingyi traveled thousands of miles to separate from the Southern Sea to the Eastern Sea, and why Xuanyi, despite being from a schism in the Daoist Tradition, was as close to Mount Qusi as a disciple-brother, acting the part of a senior.

'The schism of Mount Jingyi was most likely driven by the fear that the Bright Yang affair would spiral out of control and ultimately destroy Mount Qusi... so they took this step as a retreat route.'

He felt enlightened. Yet, Diyan seemed to read his mind. He paced once and replied,

"You need not overthink this. Mount Qusi drawing closer to Emperor Wei is not without its benefits. Southern Anchorage Sea was known in ancient times as Southern Anchorage Water Township, a place with many treasures, abundant in Water Virtue, and towering immortal peaks. It cannot be guarded by those few factions alone; my deterrent power from this divine ability is all that keeps them away."

"Liaoluo has been in the middle stage of the Purple Mansion Realm for many years. If he can rely on Ting Province to gain a few decades of respite, allowing him to take that final step, Mount Qusi will have a future to rely on... Even if he fails, it will still save us decades of fighting and bloodshed."

This had been the reason Mount Qusi had approached Li Ximing several times, and now it sounded like killing two birds with one stone. However, Li Ximing sensed something was off and nervously probed,

"Great Daoist Master, you don't have to call me 'Your Highness.' I truly cannot bear to be addressed so by a Daoist Master who has perfected his divine ability; I fear it will cost me my life-mandate... But regarding the matters of Qusi, Ting Province will do its utmost to assist. May I ask who 'those few' refer to?"

Diyan spoke softly.

"Great Konghai Temple, Southern Songzhou Luoshe, and the Innocent Guilt Gate..."

Li Ximing waited for him to list them, then expressed his worry,

"Do these people know about the Great Daoist Master's current state?"

Diyan was slightly startled, then burst into laughter.

"You overestimate the difficulty of my situation!"

When the Daoist Master wore a cold expression, he appeared quite formidable, but his smile was gentle, instantly making him look years younger. A faint hint of Kuang Yu's sunny cheerfulness was visible in his expression.

"A Spiritual Treasure composed of three Yangs, called the Primal Displaying Dawn-Contained Vessel, sits on this dome. Taking this item allows me to venture out, but I must return in time to replenish the three Yangs. It is not impossible to fight, it only risks aggravating the conflict between my divine abilities."

He laughed.

"Besides, there won't be a chance to fight... With my divine ability perfected, if I stand in the Great Void, what minor figure would dare utter a peep!"

Li Ximing managed an embarrassed smile, a weight lifted from his heart. He even felt a vague sense of hope.

"If the Great Daoist Master were to make a move... even Wei Xuanyin would likely not dare to cross your path!"

"Wei Xuanyin?"

Diyan smiled wider.

"Xuanlou and I have exchanged blows no less than a hundred times, with victories on both sides. However, his Unblemished Robe was difficult to cultivate, which allowed me to complete my final path earlier. It has been a long, long time since we last met."

Li Ximing hadn't expected Diyan to be connected to Wei Xuanyin. He was briefly stunned, then felt it was perfectly reasonable—after all, the White Victory Dao master was his friend, so one more Wei Xuanyin wasn't surprising.

However, from Li Ximing's perspective, Wei Xuanyin was ultimately an enemy, so he refrained from saying more. He quickly took out the crystal-clear bead from his sleeve and said,

"The battle in Ting Province was entirely thanks to this talisman from the Great Daoist Master; it saved my life! Now that I've completely used it up, I only have this empty bead to return to you..."

"That Xuan-Ox was incredibly powerful."

Diyan casually put away the transparent bead and nodded.

"That is a treasure passed down by Qusi, an amusing little trifle."

Li Ximing thanked him repeatedly. Diyan appeared somewhat weary. He took out a palm-sized, paper-thin copper stone, smooth as a mirror and covered in complex runes, and handed it to Li Ximing.

"This item can sense my presence. Keep it well. If Emperor Wei has any instructions in the future, simply send someone to Mount Qusi."

Li Ximing understood his intent. He had not yet recovered from his deep contemplation, and his heart was heavy with complex emotions. He silently accepted the item, thanked Diyan, and descended the steps.

The interplay of water, fire, Yin, and Yang still illuminated the place, but Li Ximing's mood was vastly different.

'Qusi...'

He silently pondered as he went down the mystical steps, finding Kuang Yu still waiting below.

"Fellow Daoist Ximing!"

She approached, her tone slightly tentative. Seeing nothing amiss with Li Ximing, she knew the conversation in the hall had gone relatively well and secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Li Ximing, still immersed in thought, cupped his hands and said,

"Please advise me more in the future!"

'Huh?'

Kuang Yu was first taken aback, then hurriedly returned the salute, her expression somewhat strange. Li Ximing didn't notice, only then truly waking up as if from a dream.

"I nearly forgot the matter of the Golden Land!"

One of the original purposes of his visit to Qusi was to inquire about the Golden Land, to prepare for his future dealings with Vast Cicada. But Diyan's revelation had been too shocking, scattering his thoughts and causing him to lose his bearings. He had completely forgotten about Vast Cicada. Now, he immediately composed himself and asked,

"In the Ting Province, Vast Cicada's methods are extremely ingenious, often relying on the Golden Land. What kind of treasure is this?"

Kuang Yu looked away, deep in thought.

"Are you aware of the Great Konghai Temple nearby?" she asked.

"Naturally, I am aware."

The matter of Great Konghai Temple had been mentioned by Jiao Zhongzi of Southern Songzhou Luoshe. At the time, the Buddhist Land of Great Konghai Temple was unstable, so the temple master, Jinghai, specifically sent Baoqing into the cycle of birth and death to stabilize the Buddhist Land before reincarnating. Because of this grievance, Li Ximing had kept it in mind. He did not expect Kuang Yu to say,

"Has Zhaojing ever wondered?" Kuang Yu asked. "A Buddhist Land is usually governed by a Dharma Master, with a Maha presiding over the disciples and grand-disciples below them. Yet, there are a few Mahas and Merciful Ones, like the one at this Great Konghai Temple, who seem to have no Dharma Master above their head."

"Ancient cultivators said: 'Seeking marvelous success in serenity creates the Golden Land; the Dharma Master is proven in the Sandalwood Grove.' The Golden Land is the core, the spiritual foundation of the boundless Dharma Realm and Buddhist Land. This Great Konghai Temple is the Konghai Golden Land itself!"

"You must understand that even if a Maha achieves the Liangli stage and is nominally the master of a Seven Aspects branch, everyone knows who holds the true power. The Dharma Masters are the true owners of the Buddhist Land. But these Merciful Ones and Mahas who are proven in their own Golden Land are masters unto themselves."

"It's a Buddhist Land?" Li Ximing spoke without thinking, shocked. "That Vast Cicada has such a Great Karmic Affinity! Doesn't that mean he has the potential to become a Dharma Master?"

Kuang Yu's expression was similarly emotional and serious. "Zhaojing, listen closely. This Golden Land is a supreme treasure of the ancient Buddhist Daoist Tradition. As many paths as the ancient Buddhist cultivators laid down, that's how many such Golden Lands exist now, whether hidden or manifest. They are the foundations that can support a true Buddhist Land, and the appearance or disappearance of any single Golden Land is enough to alarm the Dharma Masters in the Sandalwood Grove!"

"Legend has it that the earliest Seven Aspects Buddhist Lands were only individual Golden Lands at first. It was the figures within them who proved themselves as Dharma Masters, expanded their Dharma Realms, and gradually absorbed other Golden Lands to reach their current vast and stable state."

She continued, "Jinghai originally secured the Konghai Golden Land. Relying on his hard cultivation and accumulated life-mandate, he advanced all the way from Merciful One to Maha, elevating the Konghai Golden Land into a power base. Though I hear he faced many limitations, Zhaojing, it is not wrong to consider it a small, self-governing Buddhist Land!"

"He also became one of the best among the Mahas due to his Great Karmic Affinity, successfully establishing his own lineage."

The woman's blue-purple eyes blinked.

"But Vast Cicada is different."

"The Konghai Golden Land was originally traceless, allowing Jinghai to quietly become a Maha and achieve autonomy. Vast Cicada's Golden Land, however, originates from the Undefeated King of Brightness, and was under the scrutiny of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm long ago. He was propped up by others!"

"The Great Adoration Dharma Realm's true goal in supporting Vast Cicada was to annex the Precious Tusk Golden Land—or at least to bring the Precious Tusk Golden Land under their total control, making it the eighth Golden Land of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm! His future path is murky. While Vast Cicada's chance to become a Dharma Master is technically higher than other Mahas, it's actually very faint, far less promising than the highly sought-after Jinghai of the Konghai Golden Land!"

Li Ximing breathed a slight sigh of relief. After hearing the second half of her statement, he looked up in shock and asked,

"The Great Adoration Dharma Realm has Seven Daos?!"

Kuang Yu raised an eyebrow, her tone solemn. "Among the Seven Aspects, it is the only one that dares to call itself a Dharma Realm for this very reason!"
