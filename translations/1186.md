# Chapter 1186: Tang Xie

A single vertical golden mark was etched between the disembodied head’s brows. Its eyes were wide, the golden pupils within perfectly round, rotating with an unnerving slowness. Were it not for the faint current of air drifting from its nostrils, one might have mistaken it for some demonic creature.

By now, Wang Ziya had already descended the mountain, leaving the immortal realm in an empty, shimmering silence. The Daoist’s head twisted its neck and parted its lips.

Its mouth was a startling crimson, lined with dense rows of tender red plates. Two golden talismans leaped out, landing on the floor and transforming into a pair of finger-sized Daoist soldiers. They lifted the curtain and marched outside, one in front of the other. Grasping the Crystalline Jade Branch, they began to slowly drag it inside.

But the Spiritual Treasure was far too heavy. The two tiny soldiers strained with all their might, yet they only managed to budge it a fraction. Bracing themselves for another pull, they lost their footing and tumbled over, wailing in frustration. Behind the curtain, the Dao Rector let out a long sigh.

"That boy, Wang Ziya… couldn't he have placed it a little closer?"

The Daoist head waited for a long time before baring its teeth. With a strain of its mangled neck, it flipped itself over and fell to the floor with a soft thud. Its temple pressed against the smooth jade tiles as one round eye peered outside.

Beyond the curtain was a field of silver.

The silver light shimmered, interwoven with threads of white jade and trimmed with cold iron that radiated an icy chill. It appeared to be a pair of boots.

"Hm?"

The Dao Rector’s first reaction was amusement. But as his vision focused, he froze. The color drained from his eyes, and a tremor like a thunderclap shook his heart. A terror he had not felt in countless years surged through him, setting his teeth chattering.

'Someone followed him in!'

'How is that possible!'

'I was completely unaware!'

Though ancient, his mind was scoured clean, as if by a hurricane, leaving only a deafening blankness.

'How could this be possible?!'

What place was Myriad-Prosperity Heaven? This was the Dao Court of their patriarch, Xu Xiang!

When the patriarch forsook the mortal world to seek the Dao, he had sealed this realm with a peerless divine ability. The Rank Designation of Treasured Earth was not left vacant for long; it was claimed by a True Monarch named Guan Shi. Yet, even occupying that vaunted position, the new True Monarch found himself powerless against his predecessor’s great art. He couldn’t even use his Rank Designation. He wished to pay his respects at the gates of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition, but he could not even find Myriad-Prosperity Heaven!

Furthermore, Guan Shi was a rogue immortal who had achieved the Dao through unconventional means and was known to be close with the Buddhists. Thus, the powers of Comprehending Profoundity disliked him, fearing he would seize the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition and its legacy to aid their rivals. In the end, Guan Shi was slain by Merging Fire, dying without ever having laid eyes on Myriad-Prosperity Heaven.

'A True Monarch who had already achieved Fruition Attainment couldn't find this place. In the entire world today, who could possibly locate it? You could count them on one hand! And none of them would have the time or inclination for something like this!'

Even more terrifying, this intruder had found the place, yet the Rank Designation, the Tapestry of Concealed Sublime Resources, hadn’t given the slightest response. That 'Treasured Earth' designation did not play favorites; it would only fail to react for someone on the level of Xu Xiang himself or the first disciple of Comprehending Profoundity!

Considering these two facts together, how could the Dao Rector not be paralyzed by dread?

Facing the pair of silver boots, he stood frozen and mute. He didn’t dare even move his eyes, knowing that any action was futile. His mind went blank, filled with a cold, piercing regret.

'If I had known… I never should have agreed to Dongmu Heaven’s request!'

But regret was useless now. He could only watch as a slender white finger hooked the gauze curtain and gently lifted it. Light, which had not pierced this gloom for centuries, flooded in, growing ever more blinding until it finally revealed a handsome, clean-cut face.

The man had sharp, sword-like brows and eyes as bright as stars. He was exceptionally handsome. Even with his face filling the entire view beyond the curtain, at such an uncomfortably close distance, his features remained exquisitely fine, as if carved by the heavens themselves. The Daoist head could only stare, stupefied.

The man radiated no pressure, no terrifying aura. Most frightening of all, his features were perfectly clear, with no trace of the mystical haze that usually obscured the powerful. The Dao Rector did not even recognize his Immortal General-style attire.

This old being, who had hidden here for ages, was utterly lost.

But his visitor gave him no time for confusion. The Immortal General smiled faintly, a current of Supreme Yin energy flowing through his eyes. With his hand resting on his sword, he spoke.

"Under the command of the Supreme Yin Immortal Court, I am the Supreme Yin's Luminous Immortal General, Zhengao. It is a pleasure to meet you, fellow Daoist."

'Supreme Yin? Is that an Immortal Mansion? An Immortal Court? No… Supreme Yin’s Luminous… that title is far too grand!'

He was no common cultivator. He understood the sheer audacity of appending only the word ‘Luminous’ to a title that began with ‘Supreme Yin’.

'Anyone who dares do such a thing is either a fool of a low-level cultivator with no fear of death, or one of the highest-ranking Woven Jade Immortals in the service of the Supreme Yin!'

The man before him, casually lifting the veil, was clearly no low-level cultivator. The head’s eyelids twitched, his heart pounding with a mixture of shock and fear.

He spoke, his voice a hoarse whisper.

"I… I am of the Myriad-Prosperity Dao Court, from the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition… I am… the seventh-generation head disciple, an Investigating Emissary of the Dao Court, and the Dao Rector of the Proclaimation Earth Temple… Tang Xie."

His eyes were filled with a thousand questions, but they were all drowned out by overwhelming terror. Words failed him.

Finally, he managed to stammer, "May I ask… Immortal General… to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit from so far away?"

As Lu Jiangxian pondered the man’s title, a smile touched Zhengao’s face.

"It was not so far," he said quietly. "We have known of Myriad-Prosperity Heaven for a long time. My apologies for the sudden intrusion, but there is a matter I wish to discuss with you in detail."

His words sent a chill through Tang Xie.

'They've known for a long time? He didn't follow Wang Ziya? The power behind him… is already familiar with Myriad-Prosperity Heaven?'

Tang Xie’s heart grew colder, but he merely said, "And that would be…?"

Zhengao smiled.

"Why don't we retire to my manor to discuss it?"

Tang Xie stared at him blankly, a flicker of hesitation in his eyes.

"As you can see, fellow Daoist… I rely on this Rank Designation for my meager existence. It is… most inconvenient…"

"The Tapestry of Concealed Sublime Resources is indeed formidable." Zhengao shook his head, utterly unconcerned. "But the Immortal Court’s gaze encompasses the eight directions; nothing escapes its light. You need only close your eyes, sir, and I shall count to three. You will find yourself in my residence."

'He sounds like he's mocking me!'

It was the most preposterous thing Tang Xie had ever heard. Yet, the man’s silent, inexplicable presence here had already shattered all his resolve. His heart quaked with disbelief, but hesitantly, slowly, he closed his eyes.

In that instant, his perpetually bristling beard went slack. His eyelids, now sealed shut, began to tremble with the fitful rhythm of a deep, disordered sleep, hidden behind the dim gauze.

"So, his name is Tang Xie… a seventh-generation disciple. He must be a figure from the Middle Ages, at least."

The two golden-armored Daoist soldiers, having moved their prize inside the curtain, dissolved into wisps of golden light. Lu Jiangxian looked down at the head, peering through the barrier of the Treasured Earth Rank Designation as he extended a hand.

In his palm lay a white stone, upon which the two golden characters for 'Tang Xie' were rapidly fading.

'He’s on the Name Ascending Stone!'

Lu Jiangxian could see Tang Xie, but only because his divine sense was exceptionally powerful. A mere body of divine sense, facing the great art left behind by an ancient immortal, had no ability to pull Tang Xie through a Rank Designation and into the mirror. It was only because his divine sense was present, because Tang Xie was about to lift the curtain to retrieve the branch, and finally, because of his own deep familiarity with the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core, that he was able to snare Tang Xie in an illusion and deliver him into the mirror world.

'The moment he lifted the Tapestry of Concealed Sublime Resources, he was already in my grasp. Seeing Zhengao, closing his eyes—it was all a formality. He can’t be blamed for his lack of caution. The Tapestry of Concealed Sublime Resources offers such profound protection over the entire grotto-heaven. If someone could truly bypass its power and circumvent an ancient immortal’s divine ability, he would have been powerless to resist long ago.'

Regardless, Tang Xie was a significant prize for Lu Jiangxian. He felt a sense of accomplishment and, through the wondrous connection of the Name Ascending Stone, he began to probe Tang Xie’s state.

'Remarkable… truly remarkable. This is no mere Daoist Master of the Purple Mansion Realm. He is a person of genuine standing! Even on the Name Ascending Stone, the nobility of his soul is not something I can search at will.'

Though Tang Xie was reduced to a head with only a sliver of power, Lu Jiangxian could still sense his lofty status. The soul was incredibly solid, brilliant as gold, and suffused with the unyielding, noble air of Profound Mystery Heaven.

To put it bluntly, in his prime, this Dao Rector had been near the level of a True Monarch. He must have been a Woven Jade Immortal!

But Lu Jiangxian’s reasons for acting went beyond just capturing a powerful soul. His true target was this world itself.

'This is an excellent place…'

Myriad-Prosperity Heaven bore the legacy of the great ancient immortal Xu Xiang and was fortified by a Rank Designation. The two were mutually reinforcing. Forget a common Golden Core cultivator; even a Dao Embryo would struggle to find this place. And even if they did, the grotto-heaven itself was perfectly ordinary. The only potential vulnerability was Tang Xie, hidden behind the Tapestry of Concealed Sublime Resources.

But now that Tang Xie was on the Name Ascending Stone, his fate was entirely in Lu Jiangxian’s hands. Under the watch of his divine sense, if there was any sign of exposure, he could erase the man instantly.

After all, Tang Xie was far beyond the likes of Jinlian or Chi Buzi; he was the highest-level immortal cultivator Lu Jiangxian had encountered in years. By his estimation, before he recovered his own Golden Core strength, trying to dismantle such a soul would be exceedingly difficult. If any problems arose, it was best to eliminate the threat completely.

Amid his excitement, Lu Jiangxian grew more cautious. He collected Tang Xie’s True Spirit but did not immediately enter the grotto-heaven. Instead, he took a single step, departing the immortal realm and appearing within a Daoist archive.

It was the Scripture Depository of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition!

"First, I’ll get the lay of the land."

The Supreme Yin light in his eyes flared. Countless runes lifted from the shelves and scrolls of the depository, streaming into his mind at an astonishing rate and coalescing into a sea of golden script deep within his pupils.

His goal was reconnaissance, so he first searched not for cultivation arts, but for the records left by various figures. In a mere moment, he had scanned through the brief biographies, a faint sense of disappointment creeping in.

'This Tang Xie… he’s almost pathologically honest. He truly just let the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition stagnate for all these years. He watched it decline until it was bereft of talent and its Purple Mansion disciples were struggling, and he felt no regret.'

Aside from the few disciples directly from the main lineage, talent was scarce. In the modern era, the only cultivator with any hope of attaining a higher position had been a practitioner of Blazing Fire.

Blazing Fire was a fire of ascension. It was the technique known as Burning the Old Chamber from the Five Transgressive Audiences, also called World's Scorch—a divine ability that, by all rights, required deep engagement with the mortal world. Yet this cultivator, named Chong Yan, had relied on his supreme talent to master the ability entirely within the confines of the grotto-heaven.

When his divine ability reached perfection, he ventured out for the Quest for Gold. The Tree of One Heart itself had stirred for him, and great powers had moved to support his cause. Ultimately, however, he fell at the final step, perishing in the northern Feather-Shedding Land.

'The records say the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition did everything they could for him, helping him attempt a supplementary cultivation path. But judging by the portents described, if he hadn’t been trapped in a grotto-heaven his entire life, his chances of ascension would have been very high.'

It was a pity, but had that man succeeded, Lu Jiangxian would never have had the chance to capture Tang Xie. He sighed and turned his attention elsewhere. The collection of treasures here couldn’t compare to the vast archives of Anhuai Heaven, but it had its own unique character.

'The Divine Work Manifestation Art, the Flame Transformation and Rising Scripture, the Radiant Light Seeking Blaze Scripture… twenty-seven cultivation arts in total, and all of them are Qi-Ingesting and Nature-Nurturing Methods!'

These arts covered the Daos of Wu Earth, Proclaimation Earth, and Treasured Earth, as well as the virtues of Water, Fire, and Wood. They were not the fragmented, incomplete methods common to the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, but complete paths to the Great Dao.

'The arts themselves are sound, of course… but the cultivator must have the aptitude.'

This trove would be difficult to release to the Li family; it would be too easily recognized by cultivators from Comprehending Profoundity. Its greatest value was as a massive source of material for Lu Jiangxian’s own project of codifying the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao.

'Compared to these, the remaining one thousand seven hundred spell arts and techniques are even more valuable!'

These techniques were not only precious, but they didn’t require his personal attention to modify. He only needed to review them after Dangjiang was finished. After all these years of Dangjiang’s tireless work, supplemented by Lu Jiangxian’s own urgent additions for the Li family, their repository of techniques was nearly depleted. The remainder was largely unsuitable or unusable for the Li clan.

'With this new batch, Dangjiang will have plenty to keep him busy.'

Beyond these two discoveries, there was something else of immense value, something that made Lu Jiangxian’s heart race.

First was a rare technique of the Lesser Yin. It appeared ancient, written by an author named Yi Chuan. Its secrets were half-concealed; it was less a formal technique and more a collection of personal notes from listening to his master’s teachings.

It was precisely these scattered notes that Lu Jiangxian valued. Each sentence was concise but profound, revealing the supreme Dao-Profundity of the author’s master, who must have been an extraordinary figure himself.

'This has great potential. With this, writing a secret art for the Lesser Yin Purple Mansion will be no problem. And its uses don’t stop there. It would be excellent reading material for Shaohui. When the time is right, when my own Dao-Profundity has deepened and I have the leisure, I can even use it to compose a Quest for Gold method or an immortal ascension art for the Lesser Yin Dao!'

Normally, such a discovery would be a monumental treasure. But at this moment, his attention was completely captivated by something else. Its value, though high, paled in comparison to the second item: 'A copy of the Elucidating Removal of Molten Fire Abode Art!'

It was one of the Six Elucidations!

There were three pairs among the Six Elucidations, each with a corresponding yin and yang art. This one was a Yang Elucidation, focusing on the transformation between three types of fire, with Blazing Fire as the primary and Radiant fire as the secondary. It was remarkably similar to the Intercalary Sun Art in the Li family’s possession—so similar, in fact, that they were complementary.

'The Intercalary Sun Art focuses on the True, Li, and Molten Fires. This Yang Elucidation represents… a different path entirely. To think such a wondrous immortal art exists in the world!'

'Cultivators of the Three Profoundities are sitting on a mountain of such treasures. No wonder they stand a head above everyone else!'

With his current Dao-Profundity, Lu Jiangxian could often see far beyond the obvious. In an instant, another answer surfaced in his mind.

'The Chunyi Dao Gate records state that the Yin Elucidation of Elucidating Transformation governs changes with Pristine and Converging as primary and Pit as secondary. If I reverse the correspondence, the Yin Elucidation that pairs with this Elucidating Removal of Molten Fire Abode Art should govern the changes of Mansion, Pit, and Valley.'

What did that mean?

'Mansion and Valley!'

'If I can obtain that Yin Elucidation, the difficult Quest for Gold method he was crafting for Chi Buzi, the one involving the Borrowed Manor and Intercalated Feminine, which has seen so little progress, will finally find a clear path forward!'

Lu Jiangxian had been working on Quest for Gold methods for a long time. Whether for Bright Yang or Valley Water, none were simple. Chi Buzi’s was especially challenging, requiring a tailor-made solution that was largely outside his own domain of expertise. Even he had been at a loss, and the difficulty had only continued to grow.

This revelation electrified him. If he could get his hands on that corresponding technique, the quality and progress of his work would improve dramatically. With the help of his own Supreme Yin Dao, Chi Buzi’s chances of a breakthrough would no longer be a treacherous cliffside path but a soaring leap. He would cease to be an uncertain pawn.

"These are the secret arts of the Three Profoundities. Even if they are a full tier below the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core, they can still determine a cultivator's life, death, and the very continuation of their path."

After all, using the ancient immortal Xu Xiang’s Myriad-Prosperity Heaven as a benchmark, he could be fairly certain that the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core was at least on par with the secret arts of the Three Profoundities, likely transmitted only among their direct-lineage True Monarchs.

'Moreover, the Six Elucidations derive from the even more ancient Eight Seekings. Not only were they simplified, but an entire pair of elucidation arts was removed. It’s entirely possible that somewhere in the world, an immortal stele records the original arts of the Eight Seekings.'

This thought gave him a new focus, and more ideas began to bloom.

'Whether the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition possesses the rest is debatable. But what’s in this Scripture Depository is definitely not their entire foundation; it’s just for the junior cultivators. The rest is either stored within the Rank Designation… or inside Tang Xie’s head!'

As for why this Elucidating Removal of Molten Fire Abode Art was here, it was likely prepared for Chong Yan’s Quest for Gold all those years ago. His path of Blazing Fire made this art perfectly suited for him.

This meant Tang Xie was not just a high-status assistant, but potentially a living library of Daoist arts. The prospect made Lu Jiangxian impatient.

"This man has likely met truly great figures; he’s not like Dangjiang and the others. Someone with his abilities is not to be trifled with. I shouldn’t approach him with too lofty a bearing, lest he probe me for weaknesses."

"I’ll use the identity of Zhengao."

---

Within the world of the mirror.

In a pavilion of white jade, frost-like snow lay thick upon the tiles and steps. A moon bridge arched over a silvery lake. Zhengao’s Dharma Body materialized and stood for a moment before scattering the speck of golden light from his palm.

As the light touched the ground, colors coalesced around it, weaving from head to toe. Garments took shape, and a man stood in their place.

His attire was a stark contrast to the wintry surroundings. His earthen-yellow robes had a subtle luster, cinched at the waist with a greenish-white jade buckle. The linings of his sleeves were a dark blend of blue and purple, from which emerged pristine white inner collars. A round, black Daoist crown sat atop his head, and in his hand, he held a jade Ruyi Scepter as long as a sword, resting it against his shoulder.

It was Tang Xie.

As a disembodied head, the Daoist had been a terrifying sight. Now, with his bronze-colored hair and beard and his naturally commanding eyes set off by this dignified attire, he looked remarkably harmonious. A powerful, ancient aura emanated from him.

'Truly different,' Zhengao’s incarnation noted with approval.

Tang Xie’s eyes opened, still clouded with panic. He scanned his surroundings, horrified, then stared dumbly at his own hands and feet as a storm of complex emotions washed over him.

'How many years has it been? How many years since I could last move?!'

He had once been known for his unshakable Dao heart, for being honest and dependable. But any person, no matter how steadfast, would feel an overwhelming sense of bitter sorrow after spending centuries as a lone head sealed in a tiny crevice. He was so overwhelmed that the simple act of walking felt alien. He took several stumbling steps before he recognized the familiar clothes he wore.

'These are the Daoist robes of Myriad-Prosperity Heaven!'

A new wave of emotion, entirely different, swept through him. For a fleeting moment, Tang Xie felt as if he had returned to a time when immortals presided over the Dao Court and his disciple-brothers were spread throughout the world. Tears welled in his eyes. He choked back a sob.

"It is a rare thing… truly rare, for your esteemed sect to be so thoughtful."

Lu Jiangxian could sense his feelings. He had constructed the robes based on the records in the depository, almost perfectly recreating the ancient attire of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition. He said nothing, merely gesturing forward.

"Please."

Tang Xie wiped his eyes and nodded repeatedly, following him. Each solid step on the ground brought a thrill of long-forgotten joy. As he walked, he covertly studied his surroundings.

'How strange,' he thought. 'I've never seen such a magnificent and ancient architectural style. There's a hint of the Azure Profoundity in it, but without that sense of carefree detachment from the world. Instead, it has the domineering air of the Encompassing Profoundity, as if it seeks to bring the entire world into balance.'

He was, after all, a man of profound origins. He followed Zhengao into the pavilion and could finally restrain himself no longer.

"This Tang is truly unobservant," he said politely. "I do not yet recognize your esteemed order. From which great immortal family do you hail?"

"You are too kind, fellow Daoist."

That single sentence forced Lu Jiangxian to focus his full attention.

'Rather than answer him,' he mused, 'I should make him answer my own questions.'

Zhengao strode into the main hall and smiled.

"My Dao resides between yin and yang, makes its home in sun and moon. It governs all realms and commands the five elements. It holds thirty-six profound courts and seventy-two immortal palaces. When hidden from the world, only those of great merit and divine ability may perceive it; only the highest of profound immortals may ascend. Immortal Lords ride within its celestial chariots, compelling even flood dragons and sun-crows to fly low in deference. Its true name cannot be spoken freely—it once caused ancient Penglai to tremble, and later commanded the sun and moon to abandon the sky."

Indeed, Zhengao’s speech was magnificent, but its true purpose lay in the final two lines—rumors of an Immortal Lord he had gleaned from the Penglai grotto-heaven long ago.

Lu Jiangxian had several suspicious past identities, such as the Manor Lord from the illusory memories, or Yingze, the one who controlled the sun and moon. But based on public legend, neither of them could be connected to an Immortal Lord. Even the miraculous Yingze was only ever called an immortal, and he rarely had the ability to roam the world with his divine sense.

The figure with the highest status and the most similar divine abilities was undoubtedly the ancient Immortal Lord from Penglai, the one who was "rebuked by tortoise shell" in the time of Chufu.

'I heard he was a master of heavenly listening, so much so that Penglai dared not display their cultivation arts on open shelves. This aligns perfectly with the abilities of divine sense. He is also connected to the sun and moon, and his status is so noble that many grotto-heavens dare not raise their own celestial bodies.'

Possessing the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core, Lu Jiangxian had no fear of karmic backlash. He had long intended to test these waters.
