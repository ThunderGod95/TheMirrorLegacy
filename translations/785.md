# Chapter 785: Purple Mansion

When Wen Wu heard this, he leaned one hand on the boat's railing, thinking for a moment before replying.

"Junior Sister, once you are inside the sect, this elder sister of yours is your closest kin. You must remain close with her; having someone looking out for you in the sect, having an extra sister, gives you an extra path in all things."

"You and Queyi won't be returning to Moongaze Lake often, but you must maintain your family relationships. You cannot discard them."

Li Quexi nodded distractedly. Her senior brother smiled and retrieved a pair of talismans from his sleeve. One depicted a tiger, the other a dragon; one shimmered golden, the other shone brilliant white.

He lowered his voice. "These are treasures bestowed upon me when I first paid respects to the Daoist Master. The gold talisman is a treasure of Geng Metal; it can change its form at will and overwhelm other cultivators. The white talisman is a remnant of the Jade True lineage; it can protect the user. While not as mighty as the gold one, it possesses its own divinity."

Seeing that he had her attention, Wen Wu smiled. "You have these artifacts as well."

Li Quexi blinked, confused, as Wen Wu continued:

"The Purple Smoke Sect and Mu Zuo Peak are your gold talisman. They are undeniably powerful. But the Moongaze Immortal Clan is your white talisman, and it, too, has its divine uses. Have you seen me throw away my white talisman just because I acquired the gold one? Even if the white talisman’s power doesn't compare to the gold, if you threw it out, tens of thousands of cultivators would fight to the death for it."

"This is obvious when looking at Dharma Artifacts," he said, "but people often lose clarity when it applies to themselves."

The girl fell silent, gripping the hem of her robes as she nodded.

Wen Wu pressed on. "Your surname, 'Li,' and your generation name, 'Que'—those two words alone are the envy of countless others. Even if you feel no emotional attachment, you must perform the etiquette and maintain the relationship perfectly. When you eventually hit a bottleneck in your cultivation, those two words might win you an opportunity. If you fall into mortal danger, those two words might fight for your survival. You never know!"

"Even if you feel you have 'used up' those two words, if Moongaze Lake is ever in crisis and comes to beg you for help, the power will still be in your hands. With the gold talisman backing you, whether those two words become a burden or not... won't that be entirely up to you?"

Li Quexi was only half-understanding, lost in his logic. She mumbled, "Junior Sister doesn't understand these things. I will have to learn from Senior Brother in the future."

Wen Wu placed both hands on the railing. The glow of the Purple Smoke blessed land was slowly appearing on the horizon. The man weighed the two talismans, tucked them back into his robes, and let out a breath, shaking his head.

"Don't learn from me. I've been stationed overseas for so many years, I learned long ago how to be crooked. The Master has reprimanded me several times. You won't learn anything good from me... don't learn from me."

"Besides..." A smile spread across his face, and he let out a laugh. "You're a member of the Li family. An Immortal Clan that clawed its way out of that pit of vipers at Azure Pond. Why would you need to learn from me? It's more likely I should be learning from you."

Li Quexi didn't know how to respond and could only pretend not to hear. After some time, the spirit boat stopped amid the vast purple qi. A group of cultivators came aboard to make arrangements. Wen Wu, without a second glance, disembarked with his hands clasped behind his back.

He rode the wind straight toward the towering jade platform at the very center of the Purple Smoke blessed land. He passed several pavilions, ascending the heights on foot. A female cultivator in white Daoist robes, holding a jade vase, was waiting to the side. On the main seat sat a Daoist Master dressed in robes the color of autumn-yellow satin, currently studying a jade slip.

Wen Wu bowed his head, not daring to meet her gaze, and said respectfully, "Greetings, Daoist Master. Greetings, Master. Wen Wu has returned from the lake. The requested message has been delivered."

Tinglan glanced at him. "How did the Li family respond?"

Wen Wu replied respectfully, "Li Xuanxuan is managing affairs at the lake. The old man agreed to everything, one by one. He seemed genuinely unaware of the matter and appeared pleasantly surprised. After receiving the reply, he saw me off."

"As for the Bright Yang signature," Wen Wu continued, "it was not obvious. The lake has many female cultivators. Although power is concentrated, it is not the tyrannical despotism of the ancient Wei. Not everyone cultivates Bright Yang. On the contrary, their paths are quite complex; most cultivate Jade True, Pit Water, True Fire, and Cold Qi. Even their direct lineage divides their cultivation among various Daos."

Hearing this, the white-robed woman beside them breathed a sigh of relief. Tinglan leaned back against the purple jade throne and smiled.

"Good. I have met Zhaojing, and he doesn't strike me as a Bright Yang cultivator, nor does he have the arrogance of the Wei or that other Li branch. If anything, he resembles the Cui family more. Perhaps his divine ability is analogous to the remnants of the Heavenly Radiance lineage, and he does not walk the path of worldly contention. Li Zhouwei is the same... Although he strongly resembles a White Qilin, he lacks that vicious aura and extreme temper."

The Daoist Master murmured, "Neither is vicious enough. Perhaps this branch intermarried with the Cui Clan and needs not be bothered."

Wen Wu, having bowed, remained silent. Only then did the Peak Lord of Mu Zuo Peak, Qian Lizi, respond:

"This disciple simply cannot see clearly. Capital immortals Dao has this attitude... acting all harmonious now. Our sect is a Supreme Yang Dao lineage, of the Supreme Yin Immortal attribute, and holds the Purple Qi inheritance. They cannot afford to offend us, so they are naturally respectful. But now they are also weak toward the Li family... This smells of bowing to the powerful after initial arrogance."

Wen Wu kept his head down, but his ears pricked up. Daoist Master Tinglan merely smiled faintly.

"Zhaojing hates Changxiao to the bone. Do you imagine Yehui does not? Even if Yehui could tolerate Zhaojing hating him by association after escaping, he absolutely cannot tolerate removing an enemy *for* Changxiao. He will not let Changxiao seize a great opportunity while he himself is left holding the blame..."

Tinglan paused meaningfully before changing the subject. "Are all of Daoist Master Zhu Gong’s subordinates settled?"

Qian Lizi quickly nodded respectfully. "Daoist Master Zhu Gong has already given instructions, and all the cultivators have been arranged nearby. She went to Profound Peak Gate this morning. Daoist Master Yehui must have shown her around, and most matters have been discussed. She just returned... however..."

Tinglan raised an eyebrow. Qian Lizi continued with a look of half-embarrassment and half-disgust:

"Daoist Master Zhu Gong’s subordinates are, after all, Eastern Sea cultivators. Those at Foundation Establishment, along with the crowd of Qi Refining disciples below them, have awful tempers. Under the guise of 'scouting the terrain,' they went out pillaging. Raiding the wilderness and Shanji Prefecture is permissible, but a few of them went all the way to the eastern shore of Moongaze Lake... It has made the Moongaze Immortal Clan extremely nervous."

Daoist Master Tinglan seemed to have expected this and dismissed them both.

Moments later, a young girl appearing sixteen or seventeen, dressed in red, materialized on the jade platform, her hands clasped behind her back. Tinglan, who looked seven or eight years her senior, gave a slight bow.

"Sister, you have arrived."

Daoist Master Zhu Gong stepped forward. "Sister, judging by Yehui's attitude, Kong Haiying is dead. This was Zhaojing’s plot, disguised as Fu En making a delivery. You said Zhaojing was sincere and magnanimous, a stable personality. I disagree. If another Li Zhouwei shows up, won't they think they own the heavens?"

"He is truly dead..." Tinglan pondered this, then shook her head. "This matter requires deliberation. In any case, since Li Ximing is recovering in the Eastern Sea and Changxiao is missing, you must give the Li Clan some face. I will handle the Profound Peak matter. Sister, you need only maintain propriety."

"Fine..." Daoist Master Zhu Gong nodded with a smile.

"The Kong Clan has a Kong Qiuyan," Zhu Gong continued. "I happen to have a clan nephew. And that younger one, Kong Xiaxiang... I also have clan members for him to choose from. By showing such grace in their time of crisis and treating the Kong Clan with such ceremony... sending charcoal in a snowstorm is invaluable."

"This is an open and honorable move. The Kong descendants will be indebted to us for generations. Below, it will unify the hearts of Shanji; above, it will help cure these demonic Dao habits of theirs."

The wind atop the jade platform grew stronger. Tinglan poured her tea. With a single sentence, Zhu Gong had arranged the marriages for the entire Kong Clan, and in her unspoken words, the very lives and deaths of several other Kong members seemed faintly visible.

Tinglan offered a reminder, "Mount Jingyi still has Kong Gumo. I hear Xuanyi favors him. You and Xuanyi have always been close; do not go too far."

Zhu Gong hesitated, putting down her tea. "That... is indeed a problem."

***

Sea's Cape.

Flames surged within the earth's veins. Water and fire clashed violently, sending white steam everywhere. Li Ximing sat cross-legged in the center, flames exiting his nostrils with every breath, spreading outward.

The longer The Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art remained in his body, the more ferocious the surrounding black flames became, roasting his physical form until it crackled like stressed glass, covered in minute fissures. Li Ximing still refused to guide the fire into his Juque Palace, which would waste all his previous efforts. He could only intermittently take out the Serpent Origin Spirit Water.

But to his alarm, as the art's flames burned, they gradually developed a resistance to the Serpent Origin Spirit Water. Its effects were diminishing.

'If I weren't an alchemist...' Li Ximing mused, '...with a precise grasp of my own injuries and a deep understanding of fire, this technique would be truly impossible to resolve. The Mirrored-Mirage lineage... I must be careful of them in the future.'

He snapped his eyes open. His spiritual sense shot through the earth's surface, faintly hearing a clamor. A particularly effeminate voice stood out:

"You, surname Xia! Is the place right here?"

"Reporting to milord, yes, this is it..."

Excitement finally flared in Li Ximing’s heart. 'Good, good, good! This Xia woman is truly useful. She is, after all, just a local cultivator from the ends of the earth, completely without background. How could she possibly recognize complex traps... The Foundation Establishment cultivator brought his entire crew!'

The thrill passed, and he immediately began chanting internally, activating the scouting ability of the Immortal Mirror. He scanned the surrounding Great Void, ensuring not a single Purple Mansion cultivator was lingering nearby before looking up.

He saw a massive swarm of demons—shrimp, snakes, turtles, and crabs, some humanoid, some not—crowding around an effeminate man holding a folding fan and riding a giant turtle. They were slowly approaching from the sky.

The woman, Xia Shouyu, looked wretched. She was suspended in mid-air, both her calves bitten clean off, revealing the stark white ends of her bones. Disheveled and covered in blood, she still had to force a fawning smile onto her face.

Suppressing the urge to fly out, Li Ximing observed the situation. When the effeminate man glanced at the hot spring, the surprise of a Foundation Establishment demon flashed in his eyes.

"You! And you! Get down there and look immediately."

Two lesser demons eagerly dove into the water. Xia Shouyu cried out pitifully, "My lord! If you can break the seal below, I beg you, please spare my life..."

Li Ximing understood the situation. The demon clearly didn't trust the woman's words. She had probably changed her story several times and was only believed after being tortured to this extent. Hearing her still shouting, he cursed inwardly.

'You reckless fool. I am a Daoist Master... not a True Monarch. Missing limbs are a trivial fix for me, a wave of the hand. But if you die of your injuries right here, all I can do is set up a tombstone for you...'

While Xia Shouyu shrieked above, the two small demons rapidly approached his position. Though Li Ximing had not coordinated with her, his mind moved. He allowed the white skeleton and the storage bag on the ground to become visible again.

Since Li Ximing was fishing, he naturally couldn't let these minions steal the bait. He released a pulse of fire. The two small demons couldn't stand the heat and scrambled back out, yelling, "Great King! It is true, just as the human said!"

The demon leader was instantly ecstatic and scrambled off the giant turtle. He lived at the edge of the world, poorer than dirt, and could count the number of techniques he knew on one hand, let alone possessing any real Dharma Artifacts. Hearing there was likely something good in the flames, he rushed in, not forgetting to "shoo" Xia Shouyu down from the air.

Xia Shouyu's face was ashen. The demon was impatient. "Lead the way, quickly! If you force me to search your soul, you had better worry about your little life!"

'Like hell you can,' Xia Shouyu thought. 'If you were capable of soul-searching, you wouldn't need me.'

She had been terrified of this local demon, who had intentionally leaked some information before. The demon had tried soul-searching on others and killed them, losing the clue. Otherwise, why would she, Xia Shouyu, have needed to risk her own skin?

Now, inside the fire, the effeminate man saw the skeleton and rejoiced, but suspicion remained. He yelled, "You! Go and retrieve it!"

Xia Shouyu cursed him internally. She had no lower legs, the flames here were ferocious, and she couldn't even ride the wind properly. She flew halfway before tumbling to the ground. She lifted her head, staring blankly at the skeleton.

'Old thing, aren't you going to make your move? Don't tell me this old bastard can't even beat this guy!'

Li Ximing clearly read the exasperation in her eyes. The demon was already a turtle in a jar. He was merely observing the demons outside to make sure they hadn't wandered off to eat the local savages. Slightly embarrassed, he stood up, adjusted his posture, and spoke in an eerie, evil-filled laugh:

"Jie jie... Little friend, however did you get yourself into such a state?"

Watching the skeleton rise to its feet, the effeminate man looked as if he had seen a ghost. He frantically tried to activate his Immortal Foundation and pull a talisman from his sleeve, but his vision went white. Fire flashed, heavenly light bore down, and he let out a scream.

"Aiya!"

In an instant, the man dissolved, reverting to his true form: a shimmering blue, segmented sea earthworm. It flopped onto the flames, writhing in agony. He knew instantly he had encountered a truly terrifying existence. His main body, lacking a mouth, pulsed from its abdomen as if an infant were drumming inside, producing insane, muffled cries for mercy:

"This lowly... this base demon did not recognize the Daoist Master's presence... I offended the Daoist Master... Please... please..."

One couldn't blame the demon for being stupid. The circumstances were just too absurd. Even in the near seas, no sect disciple would ever imagine that a mighty Purple Mansion cultivator would be hiding in a cave, waiting for someone to walk into their trap.

Li Ximing didn't even glance at the demon. He lifted the woman and, just as before, blew a breath of air at her.

*Shua!*

Two pale, tender calves sprouted like green onions. Xia Shouyu stood steady but still hadn't processed what happened. She stammered blankly, "You... you..."

She knew this demon was no match for the skeleton, but this was a Foundation Establishment demon! It was one thing for her, a Qi Refining cultivator, to be as fragile as tofu before him, but this Foundation Establishment expert was weaker than a baby chick—at least grabbing a chick required you to reach out your hand.

'A divine ability... so this is a divine ability...'

The sea worm flopped on the ground like a piece of meat. The exhilarating rush of vengeance vanished from Xia Shouyu, replaced by sheer terror of a being who could incinerate her with a single breath. The woman collapsed to her knees, trembling violently.

"Con... congratulations, Daoist Master!"
