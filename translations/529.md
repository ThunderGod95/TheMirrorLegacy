# Chapter 803: Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing

Li Qinghong's entire body crackled with lightning. Energy surged ceaselessly within her thunderpool, and the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow within her qi sea shone brightly, releasing streams of red and violet energy that poured into her Immortal Foundation.

She had originally battled alongside fellow cultivators against devil cultivators, penetrating deep into enemy territory. When she had engaged a Murong Family guest cultivator, she had caught sight of rainbow lights out of the corner of her eye.

Having received Li Xizhi’s letter earlier, Li Qinghong knew he'd taken three Autumn Convergence Pills and had yet to fully recover. Thus, she was filled with anxiety upon spotting the rainbow light. But she had been faced with a stubborn opponent, so she quickly made a decisive choice.

She abruptly changed tactics, risking her life to inflict serious injuries and forcing her enemy to flee in a streak of bloody light. She then activated the Cyan Sparrow Plume on her body, turning into a stream of Cyan Plume radiance as she raced through lightning.

The Cyan Plume streamlight was the natural ability of the Wanglin Sect feathered robe. Combined with her innate lightning speed, she instantly caught the two cultivators completely off guard.

“Qiu Ji.”

Years ago, during the calamity at the Xiao Family market, Qiu Ji had severely wounded Li Xuanxuan, greatly damaging his vitality. He also killed Li Qinghong’s younger brother, Li Yuanyun, the sole heir of Li Xuanling, leaving not even his corpse behind.

Later, he ambushed the Li Family again, killing Tian Youdao, Li Qinghong’s uncle. Although Li Qinghong rarely spoke of it, her hatred had never diminished. Each time she revisited the memory, it felt like she might never have the chance for revenge despite how vast the world was.

“And yet you dare harm my family again...”

Old grudges and new hatred swirled within her. Violet light erupted from Li Qinghong, and dense lightning energy poured into her palm, slowly melting Qiu Ji’s head.

The devil cultivator screamed in agony as Li Qinghong said venomously, “You used devil winds to dissolve my brother’s flesh back then. Now, taste your own medicine!”

Blinding white lightning burst forth, and Qiu Ji’s figure dissolved completely amid the struggling white mist. Lightning was unrivaled at purging evil, and this single strike inflicted upon him the pain of countless lightning bolts, completely annihilating his body and soul.

If they were bound and struck repeatedly by lightning until both body and soul dispersed, even a buddhist cultivator famed for reincarnation would surely perish. Even a True Monarch would find it impossible to resurrect him now.

If circumstances were different and I didn't need to conserve energy, I'd have surely tortured him longer to satisfy my revenge... thought Li Qinghong.

The Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow within her stirred restlessly after killing Qiu Ji. Her violet and cyan radiance came about due to the resonance between her lightning and the Cyan Sparrow Plume. Now that lightning had intensified, the purple glow became even more pronounced.

She glanced back once before transforming into violet-cyan light again, instantly vanishing from her original spot, leaving echoes of thunder reverberating among the clouds.

Devil cultivator Ge had fled several kilometers before the blood pills beneath his skin finally burst, gradually restoring his speed. He’d finally managed to escape from the strange suppression of the Mansion Water dharma artifact, allowing his heart to slowly calm.

She’s probably still busy torturing Qiu Ji...

Yet, the instant this thought crossed his mind, his hair stood on end, and sharp, burning pain flared up in his back. Hastily turning around and activating his artifact, he cried in terror, “Fellow Daoist, spare me! Spare me! I have nothing to do with that man. Don’t ruin my century-long cultivation...”

Boom.

The only reply he received was from the dharma artifact in the feathered-robed female cultivator’s hand. A purple dharma bottle soared into the sky, unleashing several bolts of lightning that rammed into his demonic jar.

"Aghh!"

Since the artifact was spiritually linked to him, devil cultivator Ge immediately spat out blood. His purple-black jar emitted bursts of dark smoke, as he lost at least five years of nurturing from the lightning’s impact.

Li Qinghong’s recent acquisition of the feathered robe had significantly elevated her combat strength. Empowered further by talisman qi, lightning flickered around her. She left no room for him to escape as her spear thrust toward his chest, enveloped in lightning.

Boom!

Thunder roared again, and Li Xizhi watched the flickering purple radiance within the clouds. He suddenly felt short of breath as relief flooded through him.

Li Quantao asked blankly, "Is that Senior Qinghong?"

"It’s aunt," replied Li Xizhi.

Li Quantao smiled faintly, shaking his head as he spoke, "Thunder arts truly excel at purging demons. Senior Qinghong’s strength is impressive, I greatly admire her."

Li Xizhi felt similarly astonished. Qiu Ji was not weak; he had surpassed many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators from prominent families. Even if Li Xizhi had not been severely injured, he could only guarantee defeating Qiu Ji; killing him would be difficult.

Yet Li Qinghong, empowered by thunder arts, had killed him within a few moves. Li Xizhi felt both joy and concern, Firstly, aunt’s strength has clearly grown... Secondly, I fear she’s injured and was forced to activate the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow...

The Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow was a talisman qi specialized in combat. Li Xizhi had no doubt devil cultivator Ge would fail to escape, yet he remained worried about Li Qinghong’s injury. After briefly adjusting their breathing, Yu Yuwei approached them.

Though Li Quantao held grudges against him, he greeted Yu Yuwei politely. Li Xizhi hid his doubts, silently thinking, How injured is Yu Yuwei really? He was formidable against Tuoba Chongyuan earlier, but something seemed off just now...

The three devil cultivators battling Yu Yuwei weren’t like Qiu Ji or Ge; they were just ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm devil cultivators spawned from blood scripts. They shouldn’t have troubled him so severely.

Li Qinghong’s recent lightning strike instantly frightened away many devils, causing Li Xizhi to question the true strength of those three devil cultivators. His mood darkened further.

Since they were in poor condition, they dared not linger. They rode swiftly on the wind and followed the direction of the purple light for dozens of kilometers.

Li Xizhi’s heart chilled when he sensed several devilish lights pursuing him, The difference in numbers is too great... We've traveled dozens of kilometers and have only seen demonic qi and no immortal lights. Our cultivators aren't weak, it shouldn't be like this... It seems enemy reinforcements have arrived.

After pausing briefly, they saw the purple light returning. Li Qinghong appeared solemnly, holding a cracked demonic jar in one hand, while the other refined a black orb with intense purple lightning. Blood stained the corner of her lips, and she finally relaxed upon seeing them.

Li Qinghong was similarly aware of the dire situation. Tang Shedu and Li Xuanfeng had led teams from the east and south, but the eastern front had suffered severe casualties and was on the verge of collapse. After flying dozens of kilometers without seeing any allies, she refused to linger, preferring injury over delay. She was determined to quickly kill the enemy before her.

She paused briefly, then said softly, “Let's retreat southward first, there are fewer devil cultivators there.”

The three nodded in agreement. Yu Yuwei appeared calm and composed, revealing nothing unusual. Before anyone else could speak, a booming sound echoed in the sky alongside flickering golden lights, and a harsh, demonic voice shouted, “Tang Shedu!”

The droning roar reverberated continuously. Yu Yuwei glanced around cautiously, noticing several clouds of demonic qi slowly converging around them. The elderly cultivator’s face looked uncertain as a sense of unease rose within him, How come there are so many devil cultivators here? Where are the reinforcements?

Before he could voice his doubt, another overwhelming demonic voice echoed fiercely, filled with murderous intent, “The Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing has sounded! He already harbors suspicion! Eliminate him immediately!”

Buzz...

Li Xuanfeng drew his bow once again, the golden bowstring filled with razor-sharp brilliance. Narrowing his eyes slightly, he observed Murong En of the Murong Family clutching his stomach in the distance as a vast cloud of black qi billowed around him.

The Murong Family possessed many Dao lineages, and Murong En’s cultivation differed distinctly from Murong Wu’s. Instead, he resembled the Maha Murong Xia, his body like assembled mud, dispersing and reforming at will.

No one knew just how many things his stomach contained. Various scattered dharma artifacts occasionally flew out along with the black qi, sometimes accompanied by black clouds that transformed into human-shaped shadows.

“He doesn’t seem like a devil cultivator, rather, he resembles a Master Monk...”

Buzz...

The golden arrows at Li Xuanfeng’s waist vibrated restlessly. Most of them shone brilliantly in gold and were engraved with glowing white mystical patterns. Only one arrow remained quiet, a slender and elegant piece tinged in red and gold hues.

This red-gold profound arrow had been refined using Six Ding Merging Fire within a grotto heaven, and later incorporated by the Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact, Zhi Ge Ring. It had been unintentionally catalyzed during a clash between two Foundation Establishment Realm elites and had become exceptionally formidable. As a hidden trump card, it wouldn’t be casually used, so Li Xuanfeng drew only a regular golden arrow.

The arrow's mystical patterns slowly gained two layers of golden radiance, one layer sharp and swift, the other darker and heavier. Intertwining golden lights hummed as they fused at the arrow tip, causing the devil cultivator before him to noticeably slow down.

"Damn it!"

Faced with the dazzling golden brilliance, Murong En felt a sharp pain between his eyebrows once again. Hatred surged within his chest, choking him with rage as he urgently circulated his mana again, No wonder Murong Wu died. This man’s archery is astonishing. His artifacts and spiritual robe are both powerful. Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing described him as born with immense physical strength and had his aperture in his palm... truly rare indeed...

Despite his hatred, Murong En had to acknowledge his opponent’s strength. The man appeared to have consumed some pills or used a secret technique. His arrows contained dual-layered mana—one extremely sharp, the other corrosive—making them exceptionally difficult to counter.

The sense of danger between his eyebrows grew increasingly intense, and his heart suddenly went cold. A single thought flashed through his mind, “He's aiming for my left arm!”

Instantly, his left arm dispersed into black mist, narrowly avoiding the golden light that pierced past him and left a golden trail several kilometers behind him. Murong En cried out in pain, his expression gloomy, but he felt relief and resentment. He thought, If the master hadn’t given me the spirit artifact Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing to foresee the target of his profound arrow... damn it... just wait a bit longer...

Although Murong En’s body could reform at will, Li Xuanfeng’s golden arrows weren’t easy to evade. Whenever they struck him, Murong En screamed in agony, the golden Astral Qi fiercely slicing away chunks of demonic qi.

Though Li Xuanfeng steadily forced the devil cultivator back, his heart remained heavy with doubt. His grey eyes narrowed as he stared intensely, anxiety gripping him, There should have been two devil cultivators here... Where's the other one?

Li Xuanfeng felt something off. They had exchanged nearly a hundred blows, Murong En’s demonic body was mostly shattered, and yet despite his pitiful cries, he had no intention of retreating.

What is he waiting for...? thought Murong En.

Li Xuanfeng’s eyes narrowed in suspicion and he cast a cold glance at Tang Shedu. Had this man not constantly guarded against him, hesitating and holding back from fully confronting the devil cultivator opposite them, how could this demon still be standing?

Master Monks were naturally adept at manipulating others' minds. Murong En had easily caught onto Tang Shedu’s hesitation and cautiousness, so he deliberately avoided fully attacking Tang Shedu, instead constantly targeting Li Xuanfeng, wary of his spiritual arrows.

Li Xuanfeng glanced grimly at the cultivators amidst the fog. His subordinates were faring slightly better. Lin Shouye possessed decent strength, and Zhuang Cheng had already slain their opponent with his sharp talisman sword.

Kongheng and Wushao had each held back three devil cultivators. Lingu Lanying was similarly exceptional as she nearly dissolved the enemy’s demonic body. They'd lost only one cultivator, as even Bai Yinzi fought fiercely.

Qinghong went toward Tang Shedu’s side...

Li Xuanfeng looked toward the distant battlefield, taking in the falling immortal lights and raging demonic qi. Ominous premonitions filled his mind. Though he had the advantage here, Tang Shedu’s forces had already collapsed. There were scarcely any immortal lights left amid the rampant demonic clouds...

“What a reckless arrangement... I wonder how Xizhi is faring. Qinghong must have gone to aid him...” muttered Li Xuanfeng.

Li Xuanfeng slowly drew his golden bow back once more, his eyes growing dark with suspicion. His naturally fierce expression, coupled with the menacing glint in his grey eyes, became even more intimidating.

Something’s wrong... very wrong...

His heart felt like a stone slowly sinking into a lake. Golden light silently rose from his arms as a terrifying suspicion formed in his mind, Tang Shedu...

Why had Tang Shedu’s forces collapsed so swiftly and completely? Was he truly holding back solely out of wariness toward him, even in such a critical mission? Tang Shedu was renowned as the wielder of the Changtian Halberd. Even when he was restrained, he should have been formidable. Yet, his fighting was sluggish, as if he weren't truly there at all...

Li Xuanfeng’s eyelids fell as a chilling thought formed in his mind. It was one so shocking that it could shake every cultivator and nearly break Mount Yan Pass, Tang Shedu is afraid... He fears Tu Longjian... He fears...

His golden bow froze momentarily in mid-air as streams of light emerged across his body. Opposite him, Murong En’s demonic aura and bloody radiance suddenly stalled.

A crisp ringing sound echoed from his chest, and the devil cultivator erupted into a deafening roar, “Tang Shedu!”

Tang Shedu!

Clang!

A piercing mana whistle resonated as a flash of golden-white emerged from endless darkness. It shook countless mulberry leaves from trees, whipping flesh and bones from tombs into the sky, only to have them rain down again.

A long-prepared platinum halberd tore through thick layers of clouds. Its golden brilliance, akin to the first rays of dawn dispelling evil, surged forward like a golden pill bursting from endless mist, stabbing fiercely forward!

The halberd churned the wind and clouds, manifesting twelve smaller platinum branches. Powerful mana surged along the weapon, its aura elegant and smooth, reflecting the accumulated might of countless years.

Golden light climbed upward, illuminating pale-colored soft armor and sturdy arms, and finally revealing Tang Shedu’s calm yet ruthless face. His slender fingers were tightly wrapped around the halberd’s white handle.

The halberd was pointed straight at Li Xuanfeng!

This strike had been gathering strength for who knows how long. It had emerged like silent golden lightning slicing through the night, abrupt and sharp, even quicker than Murong En’s roaring voice.

Only when the halberd was already thrusting forward did the rolling demonic voice finally resound clearly, “The Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing has sounded! He already harbors suspicion! Eliminate him immediately!”
