# Chapter 810: The Goodwill of Nine Mounds

Daoist Master Yuandao finished speaking and pointed lightly to the small, vermilion ceramic bowl on the low table. His reddish pupils flickered as he began.

"I know Zhaojing is worried about the peacock matter. This Small Peacock Karma is not something found just anywhere in the world. Parading it about is ultimately unwise. Not only is the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour determined to acquire this fire, but at least five of the seven Northern Buddhist paths have Buddhist cultivators who could achieve their Dao using this karmic flame. Holding onto it will bring endless trouble..."

"I will give Zhaojing three choices."

He shifted his cup slightly, extended his hand, and said:

"First. Although the Small Peacock Karma is a karmic fire born of the Buddhist Land, its essence is still inseparable from the Lustful Merging Fire. However, it is unlike the Great Peacock Karma, which was personally refined by a being of great divine abilities. I am quite familiar with the Peacock Dao lineage. I can transform this fire into another type of Merging Fire for you, one called the 'Flame of Final Return.' It is similarly connected to Bright Yang and is a rare, gentle fire among the Merging Fires. It can be used for alchemy, but not for artifact refinement, nor can it be used against Converging Water or Geng Metal."

"Although the transformation process is tedious, lengthy, and expensive, and the 'Flame of Final Return' is far less valuable than the Small Peacock Karma, we happen to have a portion of it here on the mountain. You can retrieve it first..."

"That is the first option."

Li Ximing felt a stirring of interest and nodded respectfully, though a doubt immediately surfaced in his mind:

‘I’m afraid the Nine Mounds Dao lineage can only transform the Small Peacock Karma *into* the Flame of Final Return, but not reverse the process... Daoist Master Yuandao’s words imply he doesn't want to let the Small Peacock Karma go.’

While he was contemplating this, Daoist Master Yuandao continued.

"Second. You hand the Small Peacock Karma over to my Nine Mounds Dao lineage, and I will naturally provide a different spiritual fire in exchange. This fire is a True Fire, called the 'Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire.'"

"In recent antiquity, as the Supreme Yang and Bright Yang grew heavier while the Supreme Yin and Veiled Yin grew lighter, True Fires became increasingly fierce and Mansion Waters grew increasingly gentle. True Fires gradually skewed heavily toward artifact refinement. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire is an exception. The True Fire Auxiliary Position it corresponds to still resonates, preserving qualities from a much older era. It is exceptionally suited for alchemy."

"However, in combat, it is inferior to the Flame of Final Return. No matter how gentle, the Flame of Final Return is still a Merging Fire. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire lacks the ferocity of modern True Fires, making it weaker by a notch."

He took a sip of tea and finally said:

"Third. I can also compensate you with other spiritual items."

"The prosperity of Water and Fire is unmatched by other paths. I will not bully you. Besides the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, we also have a measure of Pristine Water here on Nine Mounds Mountain."

When Daoist Master Yuandao finished, Li Ximing felt suddenly torn.

‘There is no Radiant Fire. I wonder if the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire can be converted into Radiant Fire... The Flame of Final Return can be used for both alchemy and combat, and it’s compatible with Bright Yang. That is also a good choice.’

The spiritual flames Daoist Master Yuandao offered were simply too tempting. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire sounded like something only these ancient Dao lineages could produce. Transforming it into Radiant Fire would be an outrageous waste. Li Ximing felt that even if he obtained this fire, he would treasure it immensely and truly be unable to bear converting it into Radiant Fire...

Beyond his indecision over the two flames, Li Ximing harbored an even deeper, hidden worry:

‘This Daoist Master has no connection to me. Why is he being so kind? All I did on this trip was show my face, yet I’m being offered such heavy compensation? Am I about to be tied into some massive karma?’

Belatedly, he grew hesitant.

‘Hah... I always see the rich benefits right in front of me and act too hastily. I can never think three steps ahead like Brother Jun and make meticulous arrangements. I just escaped one constraint, and now I seem to have walked straight into a thicket of thorns. Fortunately, Nine Mounds doesn't seem to bear heavy malice, so this is still remediable...’

Driven by this anxiety, Li Ximing first left his seat, bowed deeply, and spoke respectfully:
"To have formed this connection with Nine Mounds, to have offered my meager strength, and to have met the Great Daoist Master—Zhaojing was already content. I truly had no greedy intentions and only hoped to remove the mark. Now, I only fear the Peacock’s oppressive might, terrified that I cannot find peace. I dare not accept the Daoist Master’s spiritual items. I only hope for a small measure of shelter to avoid their venomous beak."

As soon as he said this, Houfu paused, visibly stunned. Daoist Master Yuandao, however, merely raised an eyebrow, the corners of his mouth curving slightly. He spoke:

"You are certainly a cautious one. Since it has come to this, I might as well speak plainly... Listen closely, and do not repeat what you hear."

Li Ximing nodded quickly. The Daoist Master smiled.

"Your guess is correct. Something extraordinary was indeed taken from that hidden treasury, something vital to the peacocks. If news of a treasure of this magnitude got out, it would be enough to shake the entire Buddhist Land and alarm the Maha. Vija and Sibha themselves would come to retrieve it."

Li Ximing’s heart sank, but seeing the other party speaking so openly, he paradoxically felt a sense of relief. Yuandao’s slightly reddish eyes stared at him as he replied:

"But this matter was not undertaken privately by my Nine Mounds Dao lineage. Do you understand? It was already decided that Vija would strictly order Abbot Yukuan to personally enter the Buddhist Land and report it. This treasure cannot fall into the peacocks' hands. The peacocks cannot even know of its tracks! Although the peacocks themselves are hardly worth mentioning... their voices are very loud."

As he spoke that last sentence, Daoist Master Yuandao's expression turned grim. Li Ximing nodded in understanding. Yuandao continued softly:

"Regardless of how Yukuan reports the loss of the Peacock Dao treasury to Vija and Sibha, the two Maha will not act in earnest. Instead, they will drag their feet and handle the matter lightly. They would much rather you *not* fall into the peacocks' hands, giving them even the slightest chance of learning anything."

"The only ones you have truly offended are the few peacocks in that temple. Even if this secret is exposed one day, it will merely throw the Buddhist Land into an uproar, an internal chaos. No one will treat you as the main culprit."

"As for the spiritual fire."

Yuandao glanced at him with a smile and said softly:
"Whether it is the 'Flame of Final Return' or the 'Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire,' both are inextricably linked to Nine Mounds. This is merely my Nine Mounds Dao lineage signaling that we have protected you, demonstrating to the Buddhist Land that the Immortal Dao will not sacrifice even a single Purple Mansion cultivator over this affair."

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He nodded repeatedly, bowing once more to Yuandao.
"Many thanks, Great Daoist Master! This junior..."

Yuandao waved his hand dismissively.
"There is no need for thanks. Nine Mounds cannot help you with the big troubles, but we can lend a hand with minor, peripheral matters. Just don't blame our lineage for watching you die when your family truly encounters a disaster you cannot handle."

This statement was abrupt, bordering on rude. Li Ximing froze for a second, but Houfu, standing beside him, nodded slightly and picked up the conversation:
"The Great Daoist Master has always been charitable and has helped many people on Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain. Such incidents inevitably occur... But Zhaojing is a man of integrity, with an excellent reputation in Jiangnan. His grand-uncle... was Daoist Master Yuansu’s capable right hand."

Yuandao smiled faintly and gestured to Lingdu.
"Fetch the fire."

Lingdu immediately departed. Yuandao, meanwhile, turned to idle chatter.
"It's a long story... Back then, both Daoist friends Yuansu and Yuanxiu visited Nine Mounds. I suppose we are of the same generation. In those days, that pair of martial brothers was always bickering. They had a massive argument here and parted on bad terms. They never had any close interactions after that."

"But when Yuanxiu came to see me the other day, he looked down and wrung his hands when speaking of Yuansu, shifting like he was sitting on pins and needles. I suppose... there is still affection between them."

Li Ximing nodded respectfully, but a sliver of doubt rose in his heart.
‘If that’s the case... then even Yuanxiu, the youngest of the three Yuans of Azure Pond Sect, doesn't have much longevity left. How much better off can this Daoist Master Yuandao be? Yet look at him... his essence and spirit remain at their peak. He even retains the appearance of a young man, and his tone betrays no hint of twilight age... If he isn't using a divine ability to mask it, his life-nurturing cultivation is truly remarkable...’

He had just finished this thought when Lingdu returned from the side, carrying two small bowls.

One appeared to be crafted from Geng Metal, plated with some unknown substance that gave it a dark, dull finish. The other was another vermilion ceramic bowl. Both were no larger than a child’s fist.

Lingdu carried them before him, opening the Geng Metal one first to reveal a pinpoint of grayish-gold light, the size of a grain of rice. He introduced it:
"This is the 'Flame of Final Return,' a Merging Fire. This is the portion stored on the mountain. This fire damages artifacts, so it is best stored in seamless Geng Metal."

He then presented the other bowl. Inside was a pinpoint of bright red light, also the size of a grain of rice. Nine Mounds must possess some incredible sealing technique; regardless of how ferocious a flame was, once captured in this bowl, it was reduced to a mere speck.

"This is the 'Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire,' a True Fire. True Fire refines metal, so it is contained in a glazed ceramic dharma artifact tempered with Converging Water."

Li Ximing knew these were his to choose from. After a moment's hesitation, he accepted the vermilion ceramic bowl and said respectfully:
"This junior accepts the Great Daoist Master’s decree. I shall remember this profound kindness and never forget it."

The Flame of Final Return and the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire were nearly identical in rarity. If comparing value, the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was likely superior. The Flame of Final Return was slightly stronger and could also be used for alchemy, with the added benefit of compatibility with Bright Yang. However, Li Ximing reckoned that with his Talisman Qi, 'Valley Wind Guide-Fire,' he didn't lack that bit of compatibility.

Furthermore, the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was a True Fire. It most likely met the requirements for transformation under the Intercalary Sun Art. Even if Li Ximing had no intention of converting such a precious fire, having an extra path was never a bad thing.
‘Great Radiance of White Brilliance requires Radiant Fire to cultivate and deploy. Without that fire, it’s useless. Otherwise, the best option would be to convert it, complete the cultivation, and then convert it back...’

The subtle mysteries of the Flame of Final Return and the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire could never be summarized in a few sentences by Yuandao and the others, and their applications in various situations would differ. Even if he came to regret it later, this was the best choice Li Ximing could make right now.

"Congratulations, Zhaojing!" Houfu offered his felicitations.

Lingdu also nodded slightly and smiled. "The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire is not easy to refine. Please take this glazed bowl as well. Even if Zhaojing does not refine it here on Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain, this will make it convenient to carry."

Li Ximing had been coveting this thing for a while. He wished he could grab the metal bowl too, wipe it on his robes, and stuff it into his chest. Verbally, however, he remained modest:
"How can I possibly accept this..."

In truth, Li Ximing didn't really need the bowl. With 'Valley Wind Guide-Fire' in hand, any flame that fell into his possession, even the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, would be refined in an instant. But firstly, he needed to maintain a low profile, and secondly, why not accept a free item?

He accepted the bowl, thoroughly satisfied. Lingdu then said warmly:
"There is still the Shade-Cleansing Pool to visit... This... please allow the Great Daoist Master to take a look..."

He seemed hesitant, though whether toward Yuandao or Li Ximing was unclear. After all, inspecting another's dharma body was often a taboo act, as one never knew what measures might be left behind. But Li Ximing, possessing his own treasures, was completely unafraid. He feigned a moment of hesitation before extending his hand.

Yuandao turned his gaze, lightly tapped Li Ximing, and withdrew his touch almost instantly. The Great Daoist Master's eyes shifted, scanning Li Ximing, and he spoke with a trace of surprise:
"The Mirrored-Mirage Dao lineage traces and silver bottle marks Lingdu spoke of... I detect none of them. The karmic connection from the Peacock’s Providence Disc has also been resolved by the 'Seven Mansions Lotus Seed.' This dharma body of Zhaojing's... aside from some minor injuries, there is nothing else."

‘That old bastard Changxiao... he really is playing these games of illusion and reality!’ Li Ximing cursed inwardly.

Yuandao continued, "However... since you are here, you might as well make the trip. We can heal these minor injuries while we're at it, and perhaps advance your cultivation a bit."

"Please wait in your grotto-dwelling for now. The Shade-Cleansing Pool on the mountain only thaws at the Zi hour. When the time approaches, I will send a disciple to guide you."

Li Ximing knew this was a dismissal. He offered his thanks, bowed slightly, and quickly departed. Only after he had left the area did Yuandao ask:

"Well?"

Houfu pondered for a moment before replying:
"His talent is decent, and he has a benevolent nature. Unfortunately, his background is too shallow. He hasn't seen many true treasures, so he is easily moved and doesn't know how to refuse offers... To have reached the Purple Mansion Realm, his intellect is certainly not lacking; at least among ordinary clan cultivators, he is first-class. Among Purple Mansion cultivators, however, he can only be considered average. He has one point—the Profound Peak incident revealed his stubbornness and loyalty to his word. He can be befriended. As an enemy, he poses no great threat."

Yuandao chuckled. He looked even younger than Houfu. "Stubborn and loyal to his word? Not necessarily. He might value relationships, or he might just have been unable to back down."

***

Li Ximing arrived at the stream by the maple forest and sat down. The gurgling water was pleasant. The white jade lamp pedestals lining the stream had been refilled with a different spiritual item, but unfortunately, the grade was too low for his cultivation level and had almost no effect.

He took the red-glazed bowl into his hand, rubbing it for a moment, pondering.
‘The spiritual materials used for this aren't high-grade, but the crafting technique is exquisite. It seems to be a special refinement method...’

Li Ximing flicked the bowl lightly. Several hazy red lights immediately lit up at the rim, revealing a tiny spot of golden-red. Just an instant later, the bright red flame surged eagerly from the mouth of the bowl, erupting like a golden flower. It bloomed, petals of gold light hanging in the air, displaying their utmost beauty.

The flame immediately tried to escape. Two streams of bright red fire split, bracing themselves on the bowl's rim, struggling to pull the other half of their body out. Li Ximing seized the opportunity to observe it.

The fire was bright red overall. The outer ring was blazing red, marked with layers of faint red patterns. The interior was whitish, with flashes of gold occasionally leaping out.

This was, after all, someone else’s territory. He didn't know if there were eyes in the forest or what measures the Purple Mansion array here might have. Li Ximing did not immediately refine the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire. Instead, he simply sensed it for a moment, then reached his hand toward the blazing red outer flame.

A piercing pain shot through him. Li Ximing retracted his hand; his fingertips had turned slightly white.
‘It is far more mysterious than the Bright Yang Purple Flame... and the power of the flames cannot be compared. A True Fire has the power to incinerate artifacts; Bright Yang is the Dao of generation and growth. Although this Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire is not fierce, its ability to burn dharma artifacts and the dharma body is on a completely different level—heaven and earth—compared to the inherent Bright Yang Purple Flame of my divine ability...’

‘My dharma body should be considered quite good among Purple Mansion cultivators who haven't refined a Body Divine Ability, yet even I must retreat from this Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire...’

Suppressing the urge to refine this fire for alchemy, he closed his eyes and entered meditation. Soon, an immortal attendant approached and said respectfully:
"Daoist Master, please follow me."

Li Ximing followed him deep into the forest. Purple mist began to rise beneath his feet. After passing through a hazy purple path, he saw a small pool constructed of fine white stones. It appeared to be empty.

The attendant had already retreated. However, a person stood beside the pool. It was Dantai Muming from earlier. He bowed to Li Ximing and said respectfully:
"Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing."

"This is the Shade-Cleansing Pool. It is a wondrous land aligned with Pure Qi and Lesser Yin. Its spiritual energy is pure and gentle, suitable for all Daos. It contains a resource known as the 'Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew,' which is particularly effective at healing the spiritual sense, advancing dharma power, removing impurities, dispelling foreign energies, preserving life, and avoiding lightning."

Li Ximing nodded slightly. Dantai Muming continued:
"Please, Daoist Master, sit by the pool and circulate your divine abilities to cultivate."

Li Ximing had been thinking he would have to enter the pool to cultivate; if anything unexpected happened, it might endanger his dharma body. He was therefore quite happy to sit by the edge. Just as he closed his eyes, Dantai Muming also withdrew.

He cultivated for about an hour when he felt a sudden coolness on his brow, as if a drop of clear dew had landed right between his eyes. As expected, his mind felt instantly clear, comfortable, and refreshed.

A Purple Mansion cultivator’s Shengyang Mansion had already been pushed into the Great Void. Li Ximing could see it clearly: the clear dew seeped in from his brow and immediately began to drip from within his Shengyang Mansion, turning into a torrential downpour that pelted everything inside the mansion.

Li Ximing felt as if he were standing in the rain, and a thought surfaced:
"If one were to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm at this location, would this Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew fall continuously to keep the spiritual sense clear? If it has such a wondrous use, this would be a rare treasure indeed."

He had just finished the thought when the divine abilities within his body surged. A massive amount of divine ability dharma power flooded into him. A white mist had risen in the area, nourishing every corner of his dharma body.

Li Ximing hurriedly circulated his divine abilities, meditating and cultivating.

But the white mist was vast, and his speed of refining divine abilities couldn't keep up. Ninety percent of it simply dissipated outside his dharma body. Li Ximing watched this, feeling it was a slight pity.
"Such pure dharma power... Unfortunately, refining divine abilities isn't just about having sufficient dharma power... Having enough power is good, but how can the refinement speed possibly be this fast?"

Just as he was lamenting this, a light rose from his sea of qi. The divine ability dharma power that had spread throughout his dharma body surged frantically toward his sea of qi. Amidst the storm of white mist, a brilliance suddenly ascended:
Valley Wind Guide-Fire!

Valley Wind Guide-Fire could manipulate fire, draw qi, and refine true essence and dharma power!

Throughout Li Ximing’s cultivation life, Valley Wind Guide-Fire hadn't played a huge role. While helpful for his cultivation speed, it was far from the terrifying efficiency of Li Yuanjiao’s 'Spirit-Devouring Qi Circulation.' Only now did he realize its potential as the vast dharma power surged toward him.

But Li Ximing still couldn't refine it into divine abilities fast enough; he could only circulate his Talisman Qi first.

If 'Spirit-Devouring Qi Circulation' were here, it would undoubtedly transform all of this into cultivation base. Li Ximing could only watch helplessly as Valley Wind Guide-Fire swallowed all the dharma power in one go, refined it, and gathered it all in his sea of qi.

Li Ximing glanced at it and thought:
‘Not bad at all.’

Only then did he open his eyes. Before him was the same bamboo forest. The white stone spiritual pool at his feet was now frozen over with a thick layer of blue ice, reflecting a crystalline light. The mist in the forest had vanished completely.

His dharma body was, naturally, perfectly fine, without any side effects. It had even advanced slightly. His cultivation base had also grown considerably. Valley Wind Guide-Fire had helped somewhat; combined with Audience with the Celestial Gate and his original cultivation, he had now crossed the initial threshold.

‘This saved me three years of work.’

He flicked his sleeves, stood up, and walked out via the path. Only two cultivators were guarding the forest. Seeing him, they hurriedly bowed. Li Ximing simply asked:
"How much time has passed?"

"Reporting to Daoist Master, we have been guarding this place ever since you entered seclusion. Eight months have passed."

"Has Daoist Master Houfu left the mountain?"

The moment Li Ximing asked, the cultivator immediately replied:
"Reporting to Daoist Master, Daoist Master Houfu has been lecturing on the scriptures and teaching arts on the mountain these past few months, once per month. He has not left. He should still be on the mountain now."

‘He certainly knows how to build relationships...’

Li Ximing was in high spirits. He headed toward the mountain peak and indeed saw Houfu and Lingdu from a distance, conversing in the forest. The same chessboard was set before them. This time, it seemed to be a new game, with only a few pieces placed.

As long as they were playing, Li Ximing didn't have to worry about being dragged into a game. He walked over confidently. As expected, the two looked up. Lingdu smiled.

"Congratulations, Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing returned the courtesy politely and asked:
"Where is the Great Daoist Master? I must go and thank him!"

Lingdu shook his head. "He has already left to visit a friend. It will be difficult for him to return within three to five years."

Li Ximing looked deeply regretful and offered a few polite words, though deep down, he felt a small sense of relief. He sat down nearby, looked at Houfu, and said quietly:
"Senior Houfu, when do you return to Jiangnan?"

Houfu looked surprised. "It will likely be several more months."

Li Ximing seized the chance and said with a smile:
"I actually have a favor to ask of you, Senior... I took on a Foundation Establishment disciple overseas and need to bring her back to Jiangnan, but I have many affairs overseas and cannot be in two places at once. I must ask Senior for help."

For a Purple Mansion cultivator, a trip to Jiangnan didn't take much time. Both of them naturally understood why he wasn't going personally. Houfu just nodded.
"It’s that Xia Shouyu, isn't it? She has often come to listen to my lectures these past few months. Earlier, I thought she was a disciple of Nine Mounds seeking the Dao. Although her cultivation is shallow, her heart for the Dao is strong."

Li Ximing nodded, expressing a trace of regret:
"She was carefully selected by me, but her background is lacking... and her surname isn't Li. I worry that when she returns, she won't have the prestige or status to keep others in line... It's quite troublesome! I was just thinking about picking out a background for her."

As he spoke, he glanced at Lingdu. That old man was sharp. He said leisurely:
"That's simple enough. Just give her a powerful status. Since she'll be far overseas, it doesn't matter if it's real or fake. If Fellow Daoist doesn't mind, we can give her the status of a relative of a Nine Mounds cultivator, acknowledging a background for her..."

Li Ximing had originally hoped to angle for an outer disciple status, but he didn't expect Lingdu to be so unwilling to accept any karma, wanting nothing to do with his own lineage. He replied verbally, "That is indeed a good solution..."

Lingdu let out a heavy sigh. "There is a disciple on the mountain who just perished while attempting breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm, severing his incense line. We will recognize her as his granddaughter. Let her call him maternal grandfather... She just needs to place a few sticks of incense on his spirit tablet, and it will be settled."

Lingdu had dragged a dead man into it. Li Ximing didn't mind; it was just a matter of fabricating a title. He smiled, "Excellent! This has truly troubled Senior Lingdu!"

Before long, Dantai Muming hurriedly led Xia Shouyu up the path. The woman looked nervous and uneasy; she had absolutely no standing to speak in this place. Lingdu merely glanced at her and called out.

"Muming!"

Dantai Muming hurried forward. The two whispered to each other. It was impossible to know if Dantai Muming knew the truth, but when he stepped back, his expression had completely changed. He said joyfully.

"So it turns out she is Senior Brother Yudui’s granddaughter, the one who was lost! I will take her down to acknowledge her ancestor right away!"

Xia Shouyu reacted even faster. Her eyes instantly turned red, and she nodded emphatically. Dantai Muming led her away, speaking intimately to her along the path, appearing concerned in the extreme.

Li Ximing watched the two depart. Lingdu sighed meaningfully.

"Zhaojing... some are showered with endless sweet rain yet cannot be helped up, while others rise to the ninth heaven on a single gust of wind. It is truly hard to say..."
