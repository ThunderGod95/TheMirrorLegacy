# Chapter 1228: An Appeal

'Yin Juexi...'

The moment Li Jiangqian heard the name, he understood:

'So, the one from Qusi has sent someone!'

It was a time when he was in desperate need of allies, so Li Jiangqian was overjoyed, yet his feet remained planted as he continued to observe the scene within the grand hall, saying with a smile:

"Usher the Daoist Master in at once!"

Li Jiangzong received his orders and departed, and not long after, a flash of multicolored light appeared as a middle-aged man strode briskly into the hall.

The man was dressed in simple attire, with thick eyebrows and slightly gaunt cheeks that gave him an air of decisiveness. A divine ability pulsed through him, and his jet-black pupils held a hint of deep blue. A silver cord was tied around his waist, and his movements were so swift they seemed to carry the wind, making him appear exceptionally sharp and efficient.

The Daoist Master stood in the grand hall and saw a young man in crimson robes standing at its head. The youth's expression was placid, but his eyes were somber, and he looked formidable. Knowing this must be the eldest son of Wei, he performed a salute and said:

"Kuang Hong greets Your Highness!"

'The Cultivation Transcendence Dao.'

From his first glance, Li Jiangqian could vaguely sense the man's swift and resolute nature. He then observed his divine ability, which was solid and profound; this was clearly no ordinary person. He smiled and said:

"To think you recognize me, Daoist friend!"

This Daoist Master Kuang Hong nodded and raised a brow, cupping his hands as he spoke:

"Before I came to the lake, my Great Daoist Master gave me many instructions, mentioning that the one in charge would be a golden-eyed cultivator, the eldest son of Wei. Juexi has kept this firmly in mind."

"You have come a long way, Daoist friend, and I should have come out of the formation to greet you. However, the great battle on the lake has only just ended, my clan sister's injuries are severe, and I must stabilize our clan's secret formation. I cannot leave my post... I hope you will forgive me."

With a smile in his eyes, Li Jiangqian politely invited him forward and asked:

"My Grand Uncle mentioned you before—when did you emerge from your seclusion, Daoist friend?"

"Your Highness is too courteous!"

Daoist Master Kuang Hong responded with that one phrase, then answered:

"I came out of seclusion about ten days ago, had an audience with the Great Daoist Master, and received spiritual items and Spiritual Artifacts as a reward. Then, I was imparted a secret art of the mountain and rushed here immediately, without a moment's delay!"

Li Jiangqian nodded in understanding and said with a smile:

"In such a hurry..."

In his heart, however, he began to wonder:

'Although Diyan is a Great Daoist Master, his Dao is not known for divination, and Qing Jifang carries the national destiny of Martial Cultivation, which cannot be fathomed by any divine ability... In other words, Diyan could not possibly have predicted the great defeat at the Tao River...'

What he was suspicious of was the precise timing of Kuang Hong's arrival!

'By that logic, it's very likely that Mount Qusi hadn't expected him to arrive so soon. There should have been time for him to stabilize his divine ability and receive instruction in spell arts. It must be that the great battle on the lake erupted suddenly, and Kuang Hong, upon hearing the news, had no choice but to set out from overseas at once to rescue my clan...'

Considering the timing, if that were true, then Kuang Hong's speed of arrival was already remarkably fast—Mount Qusi was an incredible distance from Moongaze Lake, and only a cultivator of the Cultivation Transcendence tradition could have possibly arrived at this time!

'A pity... it's simply too far.'

This was enough to demonstrate Mount Qusi's sincerity, however, and Li Jiangqian's smile toward him softened a little as he nodded and said:

"You have endured much hardship, Daoist friend!"

Daoist Master Kuang Hong shook his head and said seriously:

"Your Highness may simply call me Juexi."

Li Jiangqian nodded in acceptance, but Daoist Master Kuang Hong then saluted with great solemnity and said:

"May I ask where King Wei is?"

Li Jiangqian's smile did not falter as he answered:

"My father is currently in seclusion, healing his wounds."

Kuang Hong was not surprised and nodded, saying:

"I possess a divine ability of the Cultivation Transcendence, and its miraculous effects are many. If Your Highness trusts me, allow me to see King Wei. I am certain I can be of some assistance!"

Yin Juexi's intentions might have been good, but Li Zhouwei was in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, and no divine ability could shield one from calamity better than this grotto-heaven. It was naturally impossible to agree to his request, but Li Jiangqian never handled things bluntly, so instead of answering directly, he asked in surprise:

"I wonder... which divine ability have you cultivated, Juexi?"

Daoist Master Kuang Hong answered:

"I cultivate the art of Assistance in Usurpation, one of the secret divine abilities of my Dao."

Upon hearing those three words, Li Jiangqian's eyes narrowed slightly, his interest piqued. He immediately sat up straight, focusing intently on Kuang Hong's words, and this Daoist Master Yin's expression was solemn:

"This Dao is a heterodox path. It is meant to support the world in a great undertaking, aiding in the act of challenging heaven itself. It can empower one's Emperor, allowing one to borrow the king's might to shatter enemy formations and slay their generals... it has benefits in all these things... Its inner mysteries vary from person to person and are extremely complex."

He paused for a moment, then said:

"Years ago, the Great Liang Emperor's foremost general, a man named He Shipingzhang, used this art to utterly defeat enemy armies and became famous throughout the world. His mastery of this divine ability was complete, and his slaughter struck terror into the hearts of friend and foe alike; he was the founding general of the Great Liang."

The Daoist Master smiled faintly and said in a low, haunting voice:

"Of course, once the Great Liang was founded, the very first person they killed was him."

'If a Cultivation Transcendence divine ability reaches perfection, the day its user verifies their Dao, the world would be thrown into turmoil and the new dynasty would meet a violent end. What emperor wouldn't kill such a person?'

Li Jiangqian was not the least bit surprised. A glint appeared in his eyes as he secretly nodded:

'It seems that, just as my Grand Uncle said, his very Dao lineage is tied to my clan.'

And so, he clasped his hands behind his back and said with a smile:

"I have heard of your clan's Daoist tradition... It seems you have come for the sake of your own Dao path, friend?"

Yin Juexi's gaze was calm as he replied:

"It is for more than that."

The man had considerable ambition. Though he stood below the dais, he possessed an imposing aura of his own. With a glint in his eyes, he said in a low voice:

"I have come here willing to help King Wei's great enterprise succeed, not only for my own Dao path and for the Great Daoist Master's golden seat, but also for a personal wish that I hope to see fulfilled."

Li Jiangqian glanced at him and asked:

"And what great matter might that be?"

Yin Juexi stared at him and said softly:

"In the Southern Borderlands, there is an azure flood dragon known as the Bifeng Mountain Lord, named Can Lufu... does Your Highness know of him?"

As the name settled in the hall, the crimson-robed youth's expression shifted, and he said coolly:

"Of course I do."

Yin Juexi paced two steps and said in a low voice:

"I, Juexi, was born in Qusi and can be considered a disciple of an established clan. My father, Yin Xiang, fell in his early years. My clan uncle, Yin Du, treated me as his own son and supported me to this day. Later, as his cultivation progressed, we parted ways and he entered Mount Qusi to cultivate—at the age of ninety-five, he attained a divine ability and quickly reached the Purple Mansion Realm. He was a genius of my Qusi."

At this point, emotion finally flickered in his eyes as he continued:

"Later, the Great Daoist Master gradually stopped managing the mountain's affairs, leaving my uncle in charge. At that time, my Qusi was in a difficult position, having made enemies of many powers and seeking aid everywhere... In the course of this, he became acquainted with Can Lufu."

"Little did we know that fiend had long harbored malicious intent. He secretly colluded with several clans and made a deal with the Innocent Guilt Gate. Several Daoist Masters lay in ambush together and seized the opportunity to murder my clan uncle in the Southern Borderlands!"

A clear hatred finally surfaced in the Daoist Master's eyes as he said coldly:

"At that time, it was the critical moment for the Great Daoist Master to overcome the Purple Mystery, and he nearly failed at the final step because of this incident. Later... the Great Daoist Master emerged from seclusion burning with vengeance and finally slew Fan Hui of the Innocent Guilt Gate at sea!"

But he showed not a hint of satisfaction, his eyes filled with a gloomy haze as he said:

"But as your clan knows, given the Great Daoist Master's condition, the more he acts, the worse it becomes. He beat the Innocent Guilt Gate so badly they dared not show their faces, and for a time their power waned significantly, but he was forced to accept a truce due to the intervention of several other clans... By the time he turned back, he was helpless to do anything about Can Lufu..."

The middle-aged man raised his head, his eyes calm as he said:

"Now that I have attained a divine ability, I cannot forget the enmity of my elder."

Li Jiangqian had not expected such a deep connection, and the intensity in his eyes flared.

The Li clan was far from unfamiliar with the demon Can Lufu. This was a feud passed down through the generations, and Li Jiangqian could clearly sense the feelings of every one of his elders on the matter. Even an old, conservative gentleman like Li Xuanxuan was filled with hatred, to say nothing of Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei; nearly every Daoist Master had long since placed this demon beast on the kill-on-sight list in the depths of their hearts!

'This is the unwavering will of my entire Li clan.'

Yin Juexi's words were not merely his own request and ambition; while those were important, they also represented the will of Mount Qusi—Yin Du was not just a disciple of the Yin clan, but also a man of Qusi. This enmity was no small matter to the likes of Liaoluo and Kuang Yu either!

'Even if Diyan cannot make a move, Liaoluo will certainly come to help. That Daoist Master broke through to the mid-Purple Mansion Realm some years ago and is the main pillar of support propped up by Diyan. If we were to exterminate this fiend in twenty or thirty years, there would be at least a twenty to thirty percent chance he would be another Great Daoist Master by then. Even if not, he could still lead a force of extremely crucial reinforcements!'

His eyes shone brightly, his heart now set at ease, but he did not agree immediately. Instead, he said in a low voice:

"That monster... has committed evil for many years and shares an irreconcilable blood feud with my clan as well. Rest assured, Juexi. When my father emerges from seclusion, I will bring you to appeal to him together!"

As these words were spoken, Yin Juexi's expression changed slightly, and he let out a small sigh of relief, replying:

"Thank you, Your Highness!"

After this heart-to-heart exchange, Li Jiangqian lowered his guard considerably. Just as he was about to speak, he saw Yin Juexi cup his hands and say:

"There is one more thing I must inform Your Highness about."

His voice dropped much lower, now suppressed by his divine ability as he said:

"Some years ago, your clan inquired about the Vast Earth Treasured Heart Jade from the mountain. Because it involved a major Daoist tradition, we did not dare make a fuss. Daoist Master Xuanyi relied on some of his sect connections to ask around and has more or less received a response."

This item was rather taboo, and his own clan had just secretly used it in the grand hall. Hearing these words, Li Jiangqian immediately looked up and listened as Yin Juexi spoke in a low voice:

"This item originates from the Emperor Xuan Dao Palace. It was something bestowed upon the disciples when the Sheji Dao was at its peak. There are not many left now, and for the most part, only the direct disciples of Tongxuan Palace dare to use them."

"Strictly speaking, however, the various wondrous powers of the She Immortals have long since faded. Melting this thing down would not be a problem, but... those words cannot come from his mouth. It can only be us who say such a thing."

Li Jiangqian, of course, understood his meaning and nodded to himself:

'Xuanyi claims to have some connections in the north, so it was natural to ask him about this item. But precisely for that reason, his position is sensitive, so of course he couldn't directly tell my clan that the item could be smelted... That's why he remained silent on the matter when he came to the lake...'

'But... even if the profound mysteries of the She Immortals are gone, Tongxuan Palace still has its prestige to consider. It wouldn't be appropriate for Mount Qusi to do such a thing on my clan's behalf, either...'

So he adopted a pensive expression and said:

"You mean to say, Daoist Master..."

As expected, a trace of hesitation finally appeared on Yin Juexi's face as he said:

"If it must be smelted, it would be inconvenient to do so on the mountain; I'm afraid you on the lake would have to handle it yourselves. However, this item... if your clan is willing to entrust it to Qusi, the Great Daoist Master could present it as a gift to Daoist Master Xuanyi, who could then use it to request other items from the Tongxuan Palace cultivators."

"Oh?"

Li Jiangqian noted he did not dare say 'exchange,' only 'present as a gift,' and understood that the taboos involved were indeed numerous. He calmly said:

"And what might these 'other items' be?"

Yin Juexi answered:

"It would fulfill something for Daoist Master Xuanyi's Dao. The mountain can compensate your clan."

This was not a bad option. After all, in his clan's hands, the item was only being used for healing, and Mount Qusi had done its utmost to help with their formation disk from start to finish. In the end, they did owe them a favor. Li Jiangqian said politely:

"Mount Qusi contributed greatly to the completion of the great formation; how could we not help Daoist Master Xuanyi now? If you need it, take it. There is no need to speak of compensation."

Yin Juexi, however, maintained a proper stance, not acting like an outsider, and replied:

"I will report this to Mount Qusi."

Li Jiangqian nodded in satisfaction. With a flicker of his spiritual sense, he swept his gaze across the grand hall and noticed that his younger sister was already much better, though Cheng Qian, who was bearing the brunt of maintaining the divine ability, was gradually turning pale. He then looked at Yin Juexi with a serious expression and said:

"On the Baihai Sea, there is a cave dwelling where Daoist Master Shanbai resides. Do you know of it, Juexi? I am currently stationed here on the lake and cannot leave. I must ask you to make a trip there for me."

This was something he had been planning for some time. Since Kuang Hong cultivated Cultivation Transcendence, his speed in traversing the Great Void was extremely fast, making him the most suitable candidate. As soon as he spoke, the Daoist Master nodded immediately and retreated from the grand hall.

Only then did Li Jiangqian rise, clasping his hands behind his back as he paced a few steps in the hall. A worried expression crossed his face, and he sighed to himself:

'I also promised the Golden Feather Sect I would deliver the True Fire in exchange for their cultivation method. I wonder if there's enough time...'

...

The night was dark.

The land of Shu was mountainous, with perilous peaks rising one after another, stretching for a thousand li, rising and falling before finally converging, their heights covered in ice and snow where the brilliant light of a great formation clearly shimmered.

This mountain range ran roughly north to south, steep in the east and gentle in the west. In ancient times, it was quite famous and known as Qionglai, once the residence of ancient immortals. Later, it was occupied by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and its name was changed to Changhuai.

This mountain occupied a commanding position from which one could overlook the entire land of Shu; even the Shu capital lay at its feet. The mountain itself was perpetually shrouded in dense gray clouds that isolated it from the outside world, and its existence was unknown to most. The cultivators of Changhuai were famously exclusive, meeting visitors only on a few of the outer peaks, so this majestic mountain had almost never been seen by the Purple Mansion cultivators of the world.

And yet, tonight, a streak of light flew toward this mysterious and profound mountain. It passed through the gray clouds without hindrance and descended, sinking into the depths of the heavy fog, only to reveal mountainside palaces, covered in dense, profound patterns and piled high with white snow. Pines and cypresses were everywhere, presenting the perfect image of an immortal's paradise.

The visitor came to a stop within a Profound Palace, revealing robes of bluish-gray—it was Qing Zhuo!

The Shu army had returned in disarray, and their commander's injuries were not light, yet this direct descendant of the Qing clan seemed utterly unconcerned.

He expressed no worry and did not even go to the imperial palace, instead making his way directly to this mountain, where he now stood cautiously before the Profound Palace.

An unknown amount of time passed before a sound was heard from within the Profound Palace, followed by a calm question:

"Has the army returned?"

Qing Zhuo prostrated himself on the ground, appearing extremely respectful as he said:

"Reporting to you, my lord, we have returned... The Yang clan sent no one, but the Li clan defended stubbornly. Not only did a new Purple Mansion cultivator emerge, but they also invited Liu Changdie. The Song Kingdom's support was very timely, and in the end... the White Qilin was not disturbed..."

His tone was cautious, but the person inside seemed unconcerned with any White Qilin. Instead, a soft laugh was heard, and the voice said:

"Liu Changdie... I remember him. Back then, I was the one who went with them to investigate that matter... I severed his Dao path. Has he returned to the lake?"

"Yes."

Qing Zhuo replied with his gaze lowered respectfully:

"He has a Profound Vault Invitation Letter in his possession."

These words finally silenced the person inside. After a long moment, the sound of soft footsteps could be heard, drawing closer and closer to the palace gates, followed by a cold, sharp voice:

"Whose was it? Yinghua's?"

Qing Zhuo shook his head and said in a low voice:

"This junior suspects... it belongs to the Dragon-kin..."

The person inside fell silent for a moment, and their tone seemed to turn gloomy as they said coolly:

"Tell me... if I sent someone to just kill him directly, would that not be the safer option?"

Qing Zhuo broke out in a cold sweat and bowed deeply, saying:

"I fear that if we were to offend the Dragon-kin, and they were to cause a scene, it would... reflect poorly on you, my lord..."

"Face..."

That person sneered, their voice suddenly filled with disgust:

"By siring such an abomination, I already caused the Qing clan to lose all face! Losing face in the north, then losing face in the east—what difference does this one little bit make!"
