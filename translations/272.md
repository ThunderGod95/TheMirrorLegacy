# Chapter 300: Immortals and Devils

The talisman floated gently in the air, emitting a pale white light that illuminated the surroundings. Bloodstains and severed limbs appeared before them, glowing faintly in the darkness.

Li Qinghong glanced around her, a flash of anger in her eyes. The man beside her bowed his head respectfully and reported, "Twenty-seven families, one hundred and ten people... not a single survivor."

Li Qinghong narrowed her eyes as she pressed her spear to the ground, and then cast a spell to investigate, murmuring, "No demonic qi... It was not the work of a demon. It must have been a bloodthirsty cultivator."

Swoosh...

As Li Qinghong was still carefully observing the scene before her, a black dart suddenly shot toward her, imbued with mana light and tied with a dark thread. It traveled in her direction quickly before disappearing into the darkness.

Li Qinghong had been on guard. She flicked her black hair, and with a thrust of her spear, a purple light exploded. The black dart was struck and fell to the ground crookedly.

Li Qinghong called out loudly, "Who dares to seek blood in the Li Family's territory?! You are quite bold to be lurking here, fellow Daoist!"

A black mist surged from the darkness, revealing a withered old man with an unpleasant expression, dragging the black thread on the ground with a clinking sound. The old man glanced at Li Qinghong, frowned, and said, "Why make a big deal out of this, young lady? I have not harmed any of your clan. I am merely passing through your immortal clan's territory, resting here and feeding on some two-legged sheep. You are being overly aggressive... Shouldn't a prestigious clan be more generous?"

Li Qinghong scrutinized him, her eyes brightening. The purple hue in her eyes grew more intense with more ferocity. Hearing the old man refer to "immortal clan's territory" and "two-legged sheep," which were terms used only in the northern Zhao and Yan States, she realized he was from the north and exclaimed joyfully, "So, you are from Jiangbei! Judging by your appearance, you must be a devil cultivator... Let us have a duel and broaden our horizons!"

Without waiting for the old man's reaction, she had already swung her spear at him. The old man had no choice but to roll up his sleeves, puffing out a cloud of black smoke.

Within the smoke, men and women of all ages that were shabbily dressed appeared out of thin air, all with expressions of joy.

Li Qinghong was unfazed. As her spear struck its target, thunder erupted. Thunder was inherently effective against evil, and it quickly dispersed the smoke. The men and women within screamed in agony. The old man, now terrified, cursed loudly, "Damn it, you are a thunder cultivator!"

This was Li Qinghong's first time fighting a non-Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivator. She remained cautious, avoiding close combat. Her spear gathered thunder, which she then hurled at the old man. He took two hits before he could no longer contain his rage and cursed, "How dare a mere Qi Cultivator bully me!"

With that, his robes exploded, revealing a thin and decayed body. He let out a loud roar, and from his abdomen emerged a mass of flesh which quickly transformed into a giant, bald green head with two bloodshot red eyes the size of heads, staring straight ahead. The eyes were dreadfully bloodshot and teary, and his sharp, white teeth gleamed brilliantly.

"So, this is a devil cultivator... Truly a monstrous sight to behold!"

Li Qinghong thrust her spear once more, with thunder rippling out like water.

The monstrous creature spat out a bloody mist, nullifying her attack, and cursed, "Damn it, watch your mouth! I cultivate the Path of Benevolent Devil, which is more humane than your Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao!"

At this moment, the aura around the monstrous creature had risen to the sixth or seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Although he was cursing harshly, he showed no real intent to fight.

He was, after all, a devil cultivator who had attained the status of a Master Monk, equivalent to the Foundation Establishment Realm in the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. He had been consuming humans along the way without any issues, until today. He simply could not restrain his gluttony and had eaten a bit too much. Now, he regretted it.

Most prestigious clanswould not trouble him unnecessarily, considering the reputation of both sides. However, if he encountered a clan who brought the matter to light, he would be at a disadvantage. Hence, he could not afford to injure Li Qinghong.

"I have heard the Li Family is a sword immortal family. Since this girl is proficient in thunder techniques... Her background must be extraordinary."

The devil cultivator found himself in a difficult position‚Äîunable to retaliate against Li Qinghong's relentless thunder attacks or escape without compromising his dignity as a Master Monk. His only choice was to endure, hoping that an elder from the Li Family would arrive soon to defuse the situation.

Li Qinghong, after two strikes, realized that this old man was definitely stronger than her, likely at the sixth or seventh heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm. Despite his strength, he seemed reluctant to fight, leading to a stalemate. She took out a jade pendant and silently crushed it, thinking, I haven't even used my talisman qi yet... If this old devil decides to kill, I should be able hold out until reinforcements arrive.

Lightning crackled at the foot of Mount Yuting. Despite the devil cultivator's superior strength, he struggled against Li Qinghong's forceful and aggressive thunder attacks. His cultivation appeared to be waning, driving him into a state of panic. He shouted, "Stop, young lady! Your technique is damaging my cultivation. If this continues, I will be forced to retaliate seriously!"

Li Qinghong paused slightly, noticing two beams of mana light approaching from both sides. One person arrived with a sword, looking anxious and fierce, while the other, appearing in his forties or fifties, looked solemn and stern, shouting, "Who dares to cause trouble in the Li Family's territory?"

It was Li Yuanjiao and Tian Youdao. Tian Youdao had also successfully broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, becoming the third external Qi Cultivator of the Li Family. He cultivated a Grade Two technique provided to external families and had broken through using the Minor Pure Spiritual Qi.

The two landed beside Li Qinghong with Li Yuanjiao remaining vigilant, thinking to himself, This person arrived at a convenient time, just as An Zheyan and Uncle Donghe were away... Only a few of us are left at home. We might not be able to handle him without alarming the ancestor.

The devil cultivator, seeing more people arriving, quickly undid his bloody devilish form and returned to his human appearance. With a hint of bitterness, he introduced himself, "I am Murong Xia. I came to the south for a journey, passing through the immortal clan's territories. Indeed.... I consumed some two-legged sheep. If I have caused offense, I seek your forgiveness. They were merely mortals, not worth making enemies over."

Li Yuanjiao frowned upon hearing this. Li Qinghong whispered, "Twenty-seven families, one hundred and ten people."

Murong Xia was stunned. Though old, he understood from Li Qinghong's words that these people did not resent him for taking without asking, but genuinely despised him for eating humans.

He immediately cupped his fist and responded sincerely, "You have lived in Jiangnan for a long time and may not be familiar with our devil sect's teachings. The immortal sects often said that we devil cultivators are inherently evil and revel in eating humans, but this is a big misunderstanding."

Li Yuanjiao and the others found his words rather amusing and exchanged quick glances with each other. They watched Murong Xia continue earnestly, "Even those facing death are allowed their last words. Please hear me out and do not condemn all devil cultivators."

Li Yuanjiao, seeing more and more townspeople gathering with uneasy looks on their faces, frowned and said, "This is not the place to talk. Please come with us to the mountain."

"Fine!" Murong Xia agreed surprisingly without fear, nodding.

Li Yuanjiao gestured politely, and the group headed up the mountain together despite the tension earlier. Li Qinghong sneered and transmitted her voice. "Eating humans is eating humans... Can he really talk his way out of this?"

Li Yuanjiao silently shook his head and replied through mana voice transmission, "The mountain has a grand formation and the ancestor's suppression. Once he enters the formation, we can handle him as we please."

Murong Xia sat casually on a wooden chair on the mountain, smiling at the crowd. His gaze lingered on Li Qinghong for a moment before he spoke.

"My Murong Family cultivates orthodox devil Dao that has ancient roots. Cultivators nurture a Euphoria Head within their stomach for cultivation. This is the most orthodox form of devil cultivation, even a Maha or Dharma Master would find no fault with it."

He paused, observing Li Qinghong's shaking of her head, and continued softly, "You all know the state of this world. Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivators grow people for consumption, and the Maha and Dharma Masters cycle through endless reincarnations. For mortals, life is nothing but suffering... something that is worse than death. It would be better for them to be consumed by me."

Li Qinghong sneered and retorted bluntly, "It is precisely because of people like you, who consume humans, that mortals endure a fate worse than death. It's not that life is so unbearable that being devoured would be a preferable option. Fellow Daoist, isn't it rather excessive to twist reality for the sake of self-deception?"

Murong Xia raised his eyebrows and said earnestly, "Not at all. Devil cultivation is about saving all beings. My Murong Family cultivates the Euphoria Realm precisely for this reason... Without it, we would not consume humans."

He paused again, looked at the crowd, and continued calmly, "Within the Euphoria Head lies the Euphoria Realm. There are fine wines, exquisite delicacies, luxurious clothing, and untold riches, where men and women indulge without the burdens of life and death, free from the worries of conflict and torment... Endless pleasure and happiness await within. Those consumed by me enter this realm, shedding their mortal flesh to become immortal souls. As long as I, Murong Xia, continue my cultivation, they will revel in eternal delights. Isn't that wonderful?"

His words were like a stone thrown into a lake, causing everyone to look at each other in astonishment and rendering Li Qinghong momentarily speechless.

Murong Xia sighed and shook his head, continuing, "We are compassionate. The devil sect is benevolent. When devil cultivators fight, the victor gathers the souls of the defeated into their realm, where they enjoy eternal pleasures. If everyone practiced devil cultivation, only cultivators would suffer while mortals would enjoy eternal bliss in this sacred land of eternal joy!"

Murong Xia's face showed compassion, and a faint halo of light appeared behind his head.

Li Yuanjiao frowned and said, "This is just your claim. Who knows if you consume people or gather their souls? If it is truly a virtuous deed, why does your devil form take on such a grotesque and gory appearance, and why does the world detest cultivators like you?"

Murong Xia laughed and waved his hand dismissively. The sound of the breeze, accompanied by the sounds of music and the laughter of men, women, and children, came from his stomach.

Before them appeared a green soul, bowing respectfully and saying, "Greetings immortal masters, I am Cao Yangxuan, a resident of the town at the base of Mount Yuting."

Li Yuanjiao and the others were taken aback. The town's head, who was Li Yuanjiao's concubine-born younger brother, stepped forward and conversed briefly with the soul. Shortly after, he returned, saying, "Family Head, I know that person. His voice and appearance are exactly as they were when he was still alive."

Murong Xia laughed heartily. The devil soul kneeled with a thud and said, "We are grateful for all that the clan has done for us. It's a great kindness that we could never repay, not even in ten lifetimes. Now that I have been enlightened by the Master Monk and achieved eternal bliss, I come with one request..."

Li Yuanjiao felt a sense of foreboding and asked, "Speak."

The devil soul bowed respectfully and replied, "At the entrance of the village is an old farmer named Cao Ye, my father. We lived in hardship. Now that I have received this great opportunity, I hope the Family Head can bring my father here, cleanse him thoroughly, and let this Master Monk consume him so that we can reunite in bliss and enjoy eternal happiness together..."

"Absurd!"

Before Li Yuanjiao could even respond, Li Qinghong, unable to listen any longer, frowned and spat out a bolt of thunder, interrupting the spell. The devil soul, already a remnant soul, was instantly destroyed by the thunder.

Murong Xia was furious and cursed, "What a cruel woman! What a vicious heart!"

Li Qinghong, feeling a tinge of guilt as she watched the soul dissipate, raised her eyebrows and retorted sharply, "Your entire cultivation is based on falsehood. Your so-called land of bliss is just an illusion!"

"Illusion?" Murong Xia sneered and replied, "What right do you have to decide for others? Go ask the mortals if they prefer to continue struggling in this world or enter my so-called illusory Euphoria Realm?"

Turning away from Li Qinghong, Murong Xia addressed Li Yuanjiao, "As for the Family Head's claim that our devil Dao is grotesque and detestable, it is because we conceal our utmost kindness and beauty within our bellies, using our outward appearance to bear the blame. The elders of my family are all good people who could discuss Dao with the Mahas and Dharma Masters."

Murong Xia's voice echoed through the courtyard, and he continued through gritted teeth, "In my humble opinion, it is the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivators who are truly selfish and self-serving! They appear ethereal and transcendent, but seek only personal transcendence... regarding all other beings as mere ants. That, I argue, is the true essence of the devil Dao! We may appear hideous and act outrageously, but at our core, we are the genuine immortal cultivators!"

"Heh!" Li Qinghong was both amused and angered. Many of the one hundred and fifteen corpses had not yet cooled, and the dismembered limbs and blood still painted the town red. Yet, this devil cultivator had the gall to accuse them of such atrocities. She coldly replied, "Our Daos are fundamentally different!"

The old monk shook his head and patted his belly as he laughed. "Either we fight it out, or you let me go. Family Head, you must decide wisely!"

The tension in the courtyard rose. Li Yuanjiao stroked the hilt of his sword quietly, listening intently to something. After a moment, he exhaled deeply and waved his hand.

"Please leave, fellow Daoist. Do not come to our territory to consume humans again. If this happens again, you won't escape so easily."

"Thank you, Family Head!" Murong Xia cupped his fists and strode out of the courtyard, flying away on the wind.

Tian Youdao and the others glanced at the siblings and wisely withdrew. Li Qinghong smoothed her hair and sat down to the side, laughing.

"That old fellow, claiming that his family elders are cultured and that they are true immortal cultivators inside, is clearly afraid!"

Li Yuanjiao still held the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword and replied, "Who would not be? It is like poking a wolf with a stick; both sides are scared. He fears our reputation as sword immortals, but we have never fought devil cultivators and are just as nervous. That old fellow appears to be only at the seventh or eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, but he has cultivated something so sinister that his strength must be at the Foundation Establishment Realm. This is the first time such a powerful cultivator has come to our territory."

The two exchanged a glance, avoiding the topic of the hundred-odd innocent deaths. Li Yuanjiao sighed softly and said, "We can only do what we can. Driving him away is the best outcome. There are more and more devil cultivators in Jiangnan these days... Peaceful days will be hard to come by."

Li Qinghong nodded slightly and asked, "The devil plague in Yue State... Did Sister-In-Law get any news from the Xiao Family?"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head and replied, "No news yet. But... there is some news from the Yuan Family."

Li Qinghong raised an eyebrow as Li Yuanjiao continued with concern, "Yuan Tuan from Qingsui Peak has gone into seclusion to prepare for breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. According to the Yuan Family, Yuan Tuan has a great chance of succeeding within four or five years. If she does, the legacy of Qingsui Peak will fall to her, and she will undoubtedly take on disciples and pass on her teachings. Our Li Family cannot miss this opportunity to establish influence within the sect!"

Li Qinghong immediately understood Li Yuanjiao's implication and furrowed her delicate brows, responding, "Brother, you have... Xizhi in mind, right?"

To send someone to Qingsui Peak, they must be at least seven years old, preferably between ten and twelve. Li Yuanping was not yet married. Li Yuanyun had two children, but one was too young, and the older one, though possessing a spiritual orifice, would be too old by then. They were not suitable candidates.

Currently, the only one in the generation of Xi and Yue was Li Yuanjiao's son, Li Xizhi, who was four or five years old. In four or five years, he would meet Qingsui Peak's requirements. Seeing Li Qinghong pondering this, Li Yuanjiao nodded and said, "If Xizhi has the talent, we'll have to send him there."

Li Qinghong pursed her lips together and asked, "Will Sister-In-Law agree?"

Li Yuanjiao drank his tea, recalling the moment when Li Tongya had personally handed him the gleaming Dragon Coiling Pillar sword and remained silent.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

While Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong were deep in discussion on Mount Lijing, the small courtyard at the foot of the mountain was brightly lit. Several tables had been set up in the courtyard, adorned with plates of rare mountain delicacies and various dipping sauces on the side.

A young man, appearing to be seventeen or eighteen at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, sat reclined in a chair.

"Come, come!"

The young man at the head of the table had a slightly pale face and colorless lips. He looked at the person seated below and smiled. "Brother Xiao Xian, are you comfortable here?"

"Oh yes... Comfortable! Very comfortable!" Xiao Xian replied quickly. Having visited the Li Family frequently over the years, he was quite familiar with Li Yuanping. Despite their age difference, Xiao Xian always felt somewhat restrained in Li Yuanping's presence, never quite able to relax completely or let his guard down. Perhaps this was due to the domineering aura Li Yuanping had inherited from Madam Dou.

Li Yuanping smiled. His appearance leaned more toward Madam Dou‚Äîdignified and strong, with an air of grandeur. He adjusted the cup on the table and brought up a topic, asking, "Why does your clan suddenly need ebony ore?"

Xiao Xian cupped his fists and replied, "The devil plague is rampant, and the price of dharma artifacts is rising daily... My family happens to have a fire vein and a tradition of smithing, so my father thought of taking this opportunity to make some profit."

"I see!" Li Yuanping said as he nodded slightly and glanced at Xiao Xian, then brought up a couple of topics related to Li Qingxiao. Xiao Xian listened attentively, and as the conversation flowed, they began to open up. Li Yuanping then asked, "Brother Xiao Xian, how much do you know about the situation in the Great Xu State to the north?"

Xiao Xian, slightly tipsy by now, noticed Li Yuanping's composed expression and inwardly praised his remarkable tolerance. He replied, "A few years ago, you asked me to investigate... I've learned a bit more since then."

He paused and continued, "For nearly a hundred years, the immortal Dao in Xu State has been declining, with demonic and devil cultivators emerging everywhere... It was not until four years ago that the three sects and seven gates united with the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Jiangnan, advancing northward and driving back many of the devil sects. The main forces in this war were the Golden Feather Sect and the Yue Cultivating Sect, led by the peak Purple Mansion Realm sword immortal, Daoist Master Shangyuan. He killed two Merciful Ones and three other demons before finally bringing stability back to Xu State."

At this point, Xiao Xian hesitated briefly, but then continued, "As for the Dao foundations of these Purple Mansion Realms that you asked me to investigate... it was challenging! I managed to gather some information from various sources. The Daoist Maser from the Azure Pond Sect practices Heavy Murk, while the one from the Profound Peak Gate practices Fool's Mountain Chase. The Golden Tang Gate, whose Daoist Master rarely shows up, practices Engraved Stone. Lastly, the Daoist Master from the Purple Smoke Gate practices East Mountain Loop."

Xiao Xian took a sip of wine and continued explaining, "These Daoist Masters had left many traces during their training before achieving the Purple Mansion Realm. I searched through my family's library for a long time to piece together their immortal foundations."

"Thank you, brother!" Li Yuanping responded, silently noting down the information. Xiao Xian did not understand why Li Yuanping was gathering this information but wisely refrained from asking.

"Brother, you have great tolerance, I can barely keep up..."

After exchanging a few more cups of spirit wine, Xiao Xian, with his lower cultivation, began to feel dizzy and smiled in defeat as he announced his intention to depart.

Li Yuanping, having obtained the information he needed, did not detain Xiao Xian any longer. He watched as Xiao Xian was escorted out by the Xiao family servants. Throughout their lengthy drinking session, Li Yuanping discreetly filled his cup with clear tea, ensuring his sobriety while maintaining the appearance of indulgence.

He cleared the table, laid out the brush and ink, and carefully recorded the information before folding it neatly and handing it to a trusted aide. "Give this to my brother," he instructed gently.

Li Yuanping and Li Yuanxiu were both born of Madam Dou and under her influence, they had shed much of the ruthless cunning that came from the Li Family's grassroots origins, replacing it with a grand, authoritative demeanor.

Dou Yi, seated below, took the letter. Li Yuanping glanced at him, and Dou Yi could not help but recall the long nails that were always stained with balsam flowers. Li Yuanping chuckled and asked, "Did you deliver that slap from my mother to your father?"

Dou Yi nodded hastily, stammering, "Yes, young master... I did! Father kneeled in the courtyard himself... I conveyed every word exactly as it was, even replicating the strength. The red mark is still on his face..."

"Hahaha!" Li Yuanping laughed heartily and shook his head, saying boldly, "You people fear power but lack respect. My brother has shown leniency repeatedly out of respect for Mother, but he shows no restraint. Now he has lost face and damaged our relationship, and he has only himself to blame!"

Dou Yi dared not say anything, simply responding timidly. Li Yuanping glanced at the letter in Dou Yi's hand, and this action scared him enough to send him scurrying off. Only then did Li Yuanping turn back to his desk, muttering, "However, I still do not know what the Dao Partner of this immortal foundation called Spring's Echo that uses the Cave Spring Clear Qi is..."

He flipped through the wooden slips on his desk, a deep frown forming on his face.

"The three sects and seven gates control information too tightly... If our family is to find a way out, we need information within the sect. We cannot delay any longer!"

Li Yuanping stared at the flickering candle, recalling the secret conversations he had with his brother Li Yuanjiao by the bed when they were younger, and the glittering Dragon Coiling Pillar sword that Li Tongya had personally handed over to his brother.

His face grew paler, and he muttered, "The Xiao Family is ultimately an external family... Xiao Chuting is cunning and is surely plotting something. He is not easy to deal with. But... our family has no choice but to rely on him for now. We can only take one step at a time..."
