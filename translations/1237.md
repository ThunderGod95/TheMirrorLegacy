# Chapter 1237 The Golden Threshold

His words were blunt, almost excessively so, and this Daoist Master seemed prepared for any possible outcome; though he was not normally a decisive man, he showed no hesitation now.

A shadow fell over Li Que'wan's heart, and she raised her brows to speak, but Li Jiangqian had already spoken with a serious expression:

“This Profound Vault Invitation Letter... Senior, you've spent much time refining it. Have you gained any insights?”

Liu Changdie paused, his hand resting on his cup, and said softly:

“This item has numerous effects and an air of profound, unfathomable mystery; the more I study it, the more I feel I cannot see its limits. I fear it is something world-shaking. Had Your Highness not come to ask, I also had a few doubts I wished to raise.”

He lifted his cup and said seriously:

“May I ask... what is the origin of this item?”

Li Que'wan looked slightly worried, while Li Jiangqian said softly:

“Senior, you must have your own suspicions... This was a gift from the Dragon-kin, sent to the island back then as... reparations to our family.”

'Reparations.'

Just those two words were enough; nothing more needed to be said. Liu Changdie understood a great deal, yet his heart remained perfectly calm:

'Indeed. Reparations, a gesture to save face, but it seems it's more than that now. They can conveniently continue to use me.'

He had spent half his life searching for even a trace of a Vault Metal spiritual resource to no avail, yet he had obtained a Spiritual Treasure the moment he arrived on the island; his heart was already filled with suspicion, so he showed no surprise now, only pondering for a moment before sneering:

“So they were waiting for me here all along. I see now... had I not come to the island, they might never have delivered it. They used your hands to give this to me.”

As a man of two lifetimes who had adventured for the better part of his years, Liu Changdie still possessed that much insight. Li Jiangqian then added:

“According to the Golden Feather Sect, those people originally had no intention of concerning themselves with this. But this Profound Vault Invitation Letter seems to be of extraordinary significance, and its falling into your hands, Senior, has forced them to intervene!”

Liu Changdie's gaze was clear, and he grew even calmer:

“They just want to stir up trouble. Since that's the case, how do they plan to 'intervene'?”

Li Que'wan pushed a jade slip toward him. Liu Changdie took it, read it briefly, and fell silent. After a long moment, he said in a low voice:

“Once the Harmonising and Vault Lock is in place, perfectly balanced, I won't be able to cultivate another divine ability. There will be no room to add to the Vault, and no capacity to increase the Harmonising. Is it possible... is there any leeway for me to cultivate one more divine ability first?”

The light in his eyes dimmed slightly:

“Just one more Vault Metal divine ability would be enough... If I could achieve two Vault and two Harmonising before the lock is sealed, my path would still be severed, but at least I'd be a Great Daoist Master in this life!”

“The Golden Feather Sect's meaning is that your life is in imminent danger, Senior. They are teaching us a way to preserve it... Otherwise, I fear a fatal disaster will befall you.”

Li Que'wan repeated the words of the Golden Feather Sect, and the middle-aged man fell into thought, saying quietly:

“So, my Dao-path is severed, and I'm supposed to thank them for their kindness!”

At these words, the other two fell silent, both assuming he was speaking out of anger. But when Liu Changdie glanced at them, his expression was surprisingly calm as he smiled and said:

“I understand they fear King Wei, and I always knew this day would come. In the end, I'm still relying on King Wei to keep my life, so how can I complain? As for the matter of Tianhuo, I will agree to it.”

Clearly, Li Que'wan's Whole Pill divine ability was feared by the Golden Feather Sect, and this senior understood that perfectly well; he even understood that the Li clan had to at least maintain a superficial cordiality with the Golden Oneness, and he began to mock himself:

“This might not be a bad thing. I thought I'd only ever have one divine ability in this life, but I never expected to have two. Cultivators of Vault Metal and Harmonising Metal are rare, and those with both are far rarer than even Great Daoist Masters. I suppose that makes me one of the elite!”

Li Que'wan pursed her lips. Li Jiangqian rose, a thoughtful look on his face, and said:

“Senior, you're also from the mainland and understand how these people think. They give things to others, and while it seems like a great boon, it is often not for the person's sake, but for the item itself or some other advantage—they are all waiting for the situation to change.”

“As for the words of the Golden Oneness, Senior, you should only believe seventy percent. But since the Profound Vault Invitation Letter is in our hands, whether it's related to opening a grotto-heaven or a spiritual treasury, are there any wonders about it that might offer a clue?”

A pensive look slowly came over Liu Changdie's face as he said:

“It can't be for opening a grotto-heaven!”

He shook his head decisively and said to Li Jiangqian:

“The Harmonising and Vault paths locking together... it would make more sense if you said it was for sealing a grotto-heaven. My cultivation of it perfectly fits that imagery, so how could it be related to opening one? I haven't been able to thoroughly study the Profound Vault Invitation Letter, but I have a vague feeling—I'm afraid it's related to divine abilities!”

“Divine abilities...”

He turned his hand over, revealing the thin sheet of gold, and sent it into Li Que'wan's hand. Li Que'wan, of course, knew what he meant. She pinched it between two fingers, took control of the Spiritual Treasure, and activated her divine ability!

'Awaiting the Supreme Divine.'

Li Jiangqian watched his younger sister close her eyes to sense it. A full stick of incense had burned before she finally opened her eyes, her face full of hesitation, and said:

“It really is...”

Even though Liu Changdie was prepared for it, he couldn't help but marvel at her divine ability. He nodded as if it were nothing, took back the Spiritual Treasure, gathered his things from the table, and said with a smile:

“My fortune is not shallow; my first divine ability reached perfection long ago! I must also seize the time to master this new one.”

He, on the contrary, seemed full of interest, saying:

“With the Harmonising and Vault Lock being the most brilliant Dao-lock in the world, I wonder how fast I will be able to master a second divine ability using it!”

The Daoist transformed into a streak of light and departed. Li Que'wan remained seated in silence. Li Jiangqian sensed she had more to say, and after waiting a moment, he saw his cousin say hesitantly:

“It is indeed special... A divine ability is related to one's Dao-Profundity, and I've never seen a Spiritual Treasure like this... It's less a Spiritual Treasure... and more like a key for borrowing wondrous powers. As Senior Liu's divine ability grows, I fear it will exhibit very peculiar abilities.”

But her mind was not on this. In a solemn voice, she said:

“I need to see King Wei.”

Li Jiangqian realized something important was afoot and frowned, saying:

“The matter of the Spirit Edict...”

Li Que'wan had not returned to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance for a long time. The Mystic Tablet Edict Pill required her constant nurturing, and Li Wushao, who was within it, could still strictly be considered a person. Bringing him along into that heaven might leave some unknown traces, so out of caution, she had never taken it there. She said with a serious expression:

“The final step has been completed. I will use the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron to leave a portion of my divine ability to continue nurturing it. It will be fine for me to go and return quickly.”

Li Jiangqian nodded and waited for her where he was. Before long, he saw the woman take out a green cauldron, cast a Dharma Art, and make her way toward Pingya Island. She stopped within the inner formation, and only then did her form appear within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance!

Without a word, Li Que'wan descended from the pavilion, her streak of light landing in the small courtyard where she indeed found the black-robed youth seated.

This King Wei was cultivating quietly, a wisp of pale golden radiance held between his fingers. His aura was immensely vigorous, even more terrifying than it had been during the great battle years ago!

His injuries had healed, and though his tribulation was not yet resolved, it no longer hindered his cultivation. He was simply waiting, first for that strand of spiritual qi, and second for Li Que'wan's return to aid him with the Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure. He had not been idle these past two years, sitting here and constantly attuning himself to the spell art, the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method.

This spell art could be used defensively to trap foes or offensively to kill and injure, and it had proven its worth many times in the previous war. For someone of his extraordinary constitution to cultivate it, the power and progress of the divine ability advanced by leaps and bounds, even without requiring many resources.

Now, seeing Li Que'wan appear, he opened his eyes and said:

“What is it?”

Li Que'wan's expression was grave as she said:

“The Golden Feather Sect has a fragment.”

The moment she spoke, Li Jiangqian, who had also entered, froze in place. Li Zhouwei shot to his feet, his expression changing drastically. He took a step forward, and the light throughout the entire courtyard brightened.

“At their sect headquarters?!”

Unlike the previous owners of the fragments, Taiyuan, this True Monarch, knew exactly how useful this item was. Li Jiangqian was in the great desert, Li Jiangchun at the Song court, both under the watchful eyes of others where even a moment's hesitation could give them away. Therefore, Lu Jiangxian had erased all anomalies, not even transmitting his vision, so naturally, Li Zhouwei and Li Jiangqian knew nothing!

Li Que'wan said in a low voice:

“It's in a grotto-heaven or a Dharma Treasure. It's very likely that it's the Esteemed Upper Azure Palace!”

A sudden silence fell over the realm. Li Zhouwei paced two steps, his hands clasped behind his back, the joy slowly fading from his eyes. Li Que'wan recounted her experiences at the Golden Feather Sect, causing Li Jiangqian to frown several times, before she finally said:

“They tried to entice me with the Imperial Fiend White Peony, but it reminded me of something Tianhuo once said. That spirit root was planted where Daoist Master Qiushui entered her seclusion... which means Daoist Master Qiushui is very likely in seclusion at that great lake—I came to this conclusion after combining that fact with the results of my Spirit Probe!”

Li Jiangqian frowned.

“It must be because it's within a grotto-heaven or a Dharma Treasure that no one besides you... could sense it. If that's the case, then I'm afraid we can only consider going after this item... after Father has achieved his Dao-fruit!”

Li Jiangqian's assessment was sound, perhaps even optimistic, but it had been many years since the Li family had found any news of an Immortal Mirror fragment. Li Que'wan couldn't help but feel a sense of loss. She watched as King Wei, standing before her, said thoughtfully:

“This isn't unexpected. In my opinion, whether they realize it or not, these major powers must hold quite a few fragments. In the past, whenever we found a fragment, our family was always able to obtain it, but that was a matter of luck. There's no reason to expect such success every time—knowing its location is better than not knowing at all.”

The two juniors both agreed. Li Zhouwei then said:

“As for the matter of the Xiao family... what are your thoughts?”

The weight of this question was not light. Li Jiangqian immediately looked up and said without hesitation:

“Daoist Master Xiao has a backer—otherwise, the Golden Oneness wouldn't have needed to pass along any message. With their power, even if it were a Great Daoist Master, they could kill him if they wanted to! The one behind him must be at least a True Monarch!”

He stated with conviction:

“In my view, we should just deliver the message. At most, we remain neutral. We absolutely must not switch sides over a spirit root. This is very clear. The Golden Oneness has its schemes and fears Father, but the person backing Daoist Master Xiao might not.”

He had cut to the heart of the matter in a single sentence. Li Que'wan had nothing more to say, only adding:

“The Xiao family showed great kindness in supporting our Li clan, and they share a bond of master and disciple with our Grand Martial Uncle, who received their guidance. The Golden Oneness is fickle and cannot be trusted lightly.”

The Golden Feather Sect had tried to win her over with both threats and rewards, but they had not moved Li Que'wan. She remained deeply guarded. Seeing that the two juniors were in agreement, Li Zhouwei seemed much more relieved and finally said:

“The Golden Feather Sect also understands that our bottom line is neutrality. And that white peony—that hardly counts as a temptation.”

His gaze was calm as he said:

“We only need to know they have such a thing within their sect. Once I have passed the Purple Mystery tribulation, I can go to their door and request a trade, and they will have no choice but to give it. This favor... is one they would have to grant sooner or later anyway.”

“As for Senior Liu.”

Li Zhouwei frowned slightly, and Li Jiangqian said in a low voice:

“The Harmonising and Vault Lock is absolutely not something we can meddle with! We can only let him bear this grievance.”

Although Li Que'wan said nothing, she clearly felt the same way. Li Zhouwei said:

“Then it is settled.”

Li Jiangqian's heart settled, and he took out a black jade box, reporting:

“Father, the spiritual qi has been gathered!”

“Good!”

This was earlier than expected. A flash of joy crossed Li Zhouwei's eyes as he took the item. Li Que'wan also cupped her hands and said:

“I am now free. If I entrust the Spiritual Treasure to Daoist Master Cheng Qian first, I can help you resolve your tribulation, Elder!”

The Mystic Tablet Edict Pill had an extremely peculiar characteristic: it could only be freely transferred from the hands of a Whole Pill cultivator. Otherwise, it would have to be refined anew. If this task were to be handed to another, the only option was Daoist Master Cheng Qian in the Eastern Sea!

But Li Zhouwei shook his head and smiled:

“No need to rush.”

He weighed the black jade box in his hands and said softly:

“Let me first consume this qi and forge my immortal foundation. Once that is done, I can nourish it with a strand of Talisman Qi. Even if I immediately enter seclusion to heal, my immortal foundation will be constantly nourished, advancing my cultivation—only then will I have made up for all this lost time.”

“This way, even if resolving the tribulation takes five or six years, by the time it's done, my immortal foundation will be nearly perfected, and I can immediately attempt to manifest my first divine ability!”

Li Zhouwei's plan was perfect. Even for someone with his sublime talent and Dao-Profundity, he had to make numerous preparations to face the Purple Mystery:

'Succeeding on the first try is too unlikely. I still have the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill that Grand Uncle traded for. No need to use it hastily. I'll use it to reinforce my Shengyang Acupoint first, and it won't be too late to use it on my second, or even third, attempt!'

After saying this, his expression turned serious:

“Que'wan, Daoist Master Cheng Qian's divine ability is ultimately a bit lacking, and there is a risk of the treasure being stolen. Guest Retainer Wushao has already endured turmoil and is not stable. You should take over the Spirit Edict affair now and see it through to a stable conclusion. In the meantime, study some spell arts. When you come again, the timing for both matters will be perfect.”

Li Que'wan solemnly agreed and withdrew from the grotto-heaven, leaving Li Jiangqian waiting before his father.

This Daoist Master of Li Fire pondered for a long time before speaking softly:

“Father... I have recently come to know a junior named Li Suining.”

His low voice echoed through the realm. The man in black before him slowly turned his head, causing Li Jiangqian to feel a faint, almost imperceptible chill. He quickly lowered his head and said:

“I saw that the old master is also protecting him, so I did not make any rash contact. Your son is unsure how to proceed and has come specifically to ask for your guidance, Father.”

Li Zhouwei showed not the slightest surprise, merely gazing at him quietly:

“You tell me. How should it be handled?”

Li Jiangqian bowed and said:

“I have seen his cultivation method; it requires the creation of a mystic realm, which is no simple matter. Although our family does not have a great need for a mystic realm, as the number of Daoist Masters and Guest Retainers in our service slowly grows, we will need a reason for why our people disappear after entering the inner formation... No matter how precious it is, we must obtain it.”

He lowered his gaze, his bright golden eyes filled with a smiling expression as he said:

“I will certainly watch over him well, so that Father may enter seclusion without worry!”

A smile also touched the corners of Li Zhouwei's mouth. He took two steps with his hands clasped behind his back and said:

“Very well, you may go back!”

He paused, then said, as if with some difficulty:

“This business in the great desert... you did well.”

His second son was taken aback for a moment, then gave a chuckle, and stepping on flames, vanished in a streak of light. The smile on the black-robed man's face slowly deepened as he returned to the stone platform where he always rested and sat down cross-legged:

'This child, he won't bow his head until he sees a true immortal. He's more cunning than Jianglong, more suspicious than Jiangxia, and doesn't have half of Jiangliang's sincerity... Yet it's precisely because he is this way that when he stands guard over the island, it puts one's mind strangely at ease.'
