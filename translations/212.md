# Chapter 228: Wolf-like Gray Pupils

"Mount Yue should have fragmented, so why try to unify them by force? The devil lord stood upon the clouds... to ensure that he... that he would be left with no place to be buried!" a narrator shouted hoarsely, beating against gongs.

The actor playing Jianixi, a young general dressed in a black robe, exuded an aura of power. With a flick of his robe, he declared, "Ha! I did this deed... and it is known to you, to me, and to the heavens and earth alike. Even if I die and become a ghost, my heart will remain guilt-free!"

In unison, the audience leaned forward and sighed deeply, and some even stood up to cheer. In the minds of the Mount Yue people, Jianixi held a high status. Many of the Mount Yue people who migrated from the Great Jueting were refugees who brought with them stories of Jianixi's last days.

The reverence of the Mount Yue people mixed with the fear of the natives of Lijing Town had given birth to the figure of this ruler who stood both just and evil.

The old man continued to sigh, while a gentle voice from behind him‚Äîcalm and clear amid the commotion.

"Elder, why are you sighing?"

The old man shook his head, his eyes filled with sentiment as he whispered, "When I was thirty, I followed Lord Xiangping to the lands of Mount Yue... I saw many things. Jianixi was... a heroic figure."

Turning to look at the person behind him, he saw a man who appeared middle-aged, with broad shoulders and long, gentle eyebrows. His aura was commanding, and he stood with his hands behind his back. Knowing that he was no ordinary person, the old man's attitude immediately became much more respectful.

On stage, the narrator sang and continued to beat against his gongs.

"You, you, you‚Äîdon't harm the people under your rule!"

"Bah! The common folk shall be my carriage, and my soldiers will be my blade and lance. Ha! What can you do about it?!" The young general in the black robe shouted loudly, and the people in the audience withdrew their heads in silence.

The middle-aged man nodded slightly and murmured, "Such words are something Jianixi would have said... He had such spirit."

"Indeed!" the old man said as he slapped his thigh and laughed. He then continued, "The next act is called Lord Xiangping's Soul Returns Home, and Mu Jiaoman Seizes Power During a Drought, which will make people sigh and curse with rage. It'll be quite a sight to see!"

"Drought..." Li Tongya muttered softly and whispered, "There was indeed a severe drought back then."

"How old were you at the time, to remember such things? That's remarkable!" the old man praised.

The longer he looked at Li Tongya, the more familiar he seemed, though he could not recall where he had seen him before. Tentatively, he asked, "My lord... is your surname Li?"

Li Tongya shook his head gently and did not respond directly. Instead, he smiled and said softly in light amusement, "This young general in the black robe is nearly perfect, except for his eye color... Jianixi had fierce brown eyes."

"The fierce brown eyes of the eagle owl are a rare sight!" the old man responded cheerfully. Seeing that Li Tongya appeared refined and courteous, giving him the respect he deserved, he leaned in closer and whispered in his ear.

"My Lord, the world always speaks of the wolf with the fierce eyes of an eagle owl... Since you know the sign of fierce brown eyes, are you also aware of another ominous trait?"

"Oh?"

Li Tongya's curiosity was instantly piqued, and he smiled warmly, urging the man to share more. "Tell me more, Elder," he encouraged with a small smile.

The old man coughed and then lowered his voice even further. If Li Tongya had not had exceptional hearing, he might not have caught the old man's words in the noisy environment.

"Eagle-owl-like brown eyes and wolf-like gray pupils... those with wolf-like gray pupils possess the appearance of the Wolf Lord described in the play‚Äîeyes gray and white, cautious and suspicious, harboring ill intentions, and always scanning around while walking... Such people have a nature that seeks to devour and annex enemies."

"I see!" Li Tongya laughed heartily, instantly grasping the old man's meaning. "People with fierce brown eyes are hard to find, but those with wolf-like gray pupils are abundant in Lijing Town!" he replied with a grin.

"Hah!" the old man jumped in surprise, forcing a bitter smile and whispering, "As long as you understand, my lord! Speaking of this openly isn't a pleasant topic..."

Li Tongya chuckled softly, recognizing that the old man was hinting at the Li Family, the master household. He straightened his expression and asked, "Since you are knowledgeable about face reading, Elder... why not take a look at me?"

The old man chuckled and observed Li Tongya for a while before responding.

"You have an imposing aura and the face of one who will guard his domain... blessed with great fortune beyond description."

Li Tongya let out a small laugh as the crowd erupted into a noisy frenzy. The play on stage had reached a climax, and the actor playing Jianixi had fallen. The old man quickly looked up, but when he turned back with a sigh, the person behind him had vanished.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

On Mount Lijing, Chen Donghe stood in the courtyard, dressed in white. A gentle drizzle slid past him, blocked by his mana. He slowly drew his sword, and a pale gray aura glowed from the blade.

Opposite him, Li Xuanling had already drawn his sword, which was also radiating a gray light. Chen Donghe nodded and advanced with his sword drawn.

"Here I come!" he announced.

Li Xuanling did not unsheathe his sword immediately but instead watched Chen Donghe approach with a smile on his face. When Chen Donghe reached him, Li Xuanling finally drew his sword, unleashing a bright white arc.

Chen Donghe's pupils widened, and he switched to a defensive position right away, exclaiming in surprise, "The Celestial Moon Slash!"

The sword technique clashed with Chen Donghe's blade, forcing him to retreat several steps backward. He tightened his grip and steadied his breath before taking another step back to regain his composure.

Li Xuanling capitalized on his momentum and advanced with relentless sword moves.

Chen Donghe had not expected Li Xuanling to have mastered the Celestial Moon Slash technique and suffered a slight loss, leaving him at a disadvantage. However, both men had practiced the River One Qi Technique and the Profound Water Sword Technique, so they were rather familiar with each other's techniques.

With his stronger foundation, Chen Donghe quickly turned the tide and went on the offensive, suppressing Li Xuanling.

"Brother-In-Law is indeed superior!"

After an hour of fighting, Li Xuanling, slightly breathless, sheathed his sword and stepped backward, admitting his defeat.

Chen Donghe also returned his sword to its sheath and smiled.

"I never thought you had mastered the Celestial Moon Slash technique. Congratulations," he praised with a smile.

"Twelve years, and that is all I have got..." Li Xuanling said as he shook his head and sighed.

His voice was melancholic as he continued, "My father could use this Celestial Moon Slash technique when he was only at the Embryonic Breathing Realm... I, however, had only managed to wield it with true essence after I reached the Qi Cultivation Realm. The difference is clear..."

Chen Donghe shook his head and smiled, reassuring him, "Don't compare yourself with your father. How many around the lake can rival him? Your talent in swordsmanship is already remarkable. I can only suppress you because I'm a few years older... Don't underestimate yourself."

"But Yuanjiao has already mastered the sword aura... His talent in this is quite good, possibly better than mine," he said quietly

The mention of Li Tongya brought a look of concern to Li Xuanling's eyes, and he said quietly, "I wonder how Father is doing now."

As soon as he spoke, the courtyard door creaked open, revealing a middle-aged man stepping inside. His temples were graying, and he wore a gray robe and simple cloth shoes. Though he radiated no mana, the light drizzle did not wet him at all. Raindrops slid off his silhouette obediently before touching him, giving an otherworldly impression.

The man raised an eyebrow and took a step forward, making the puddles part away like they had come to life, keeping his cloth shoes perfectly dry. He then shot out a word of advice.

"If that sword technique had shifted two degrees to the right, you would have held your own against Donghe."

"Father!"

Li Xuanling was immediately overjoyed and stepped forward with excitement. After studying the man for a moment, he exclaimed, "Father, you've established your immortal foundation!"

Li Tongya nodded with a gentle smile, and Chen Donghe respectfully cupped his fist and congratulated him, "Congratulations, Second Uncle!"

Li Tongya looked at the two younger men in front of him, their faces radiating uncontrollable joy, and felt immense satisfaction within him. He smiled, proud.

"Now, our Li Family is the third Foundation Establishment Clan on the lake!"

Li Tongya took the main seat in the courtyard, with members of the Li Family sitting neatly below him. Everyone wore joyful expressions, chatting and laughing heartily with one another.

Li Tongya smiled gently from his position at the head of the table, with Li Xuanfeng at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm on his left, and Li Xuanxuan at the second heavenly layer on his right. Below them sat Li Xuanling and Chen Donghe, and at the bottom were Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanyun. Together, they spoke in unison.

"Congratulations, Second Uncle/Father/Granduncle, on successfully establishing your immortal foundation!"

Li Tongya nodded and said with a smile, "During my seclusion this time, I've formed the Boundless Ocean and advanced to the Foundation Establishment Realm... Our family is now a clan and consequent changes must be made."

After saying these words, he then looked at Li Xuanxuan and asked, "Xuan'er, how have things been on the lake these years?"

Li Xuanxuan stood up and cupped his hands respectfully before replying, "Second Uncle, you were only in seclusion for a month when a geological upheaval struck the Milin Prefecture. It caused the ground to crack, towns to collapse, and it left Yu Mugao at a loss. Soon after, the three main roads leading out of Milin Prefecture were attacked. Relay stations and narrow passes were targeted, people were killed, roads were destroyed, and the mountain passes were blocked. Yu Mugao was furious but had to handle things alone. The younger generation of the Yu Family is hardly promising, and Yu Mujian remains in seclusion... Do you remember the one who harmed Yuanxiu?"

Li Tongya nodded slowly. That person was clever, quickly using others' corpses to create diversions and disposing of two storage pouches to prevent giving resources to enemies. Knowing escape was impossible, he had used talismans to destroy his own body.

Quite a feat, indeed.

Li Xuanxuan nodded and continued, "That man, Yu Muyuan, was Yu Mugao's capable assistant‚Äîkeen and decisive... With Yu Muyuan gone, Yu Mugao is now overwhelmed and struggling. The next year, before the market in Milin Prefecture could be fully restored, a rogue cultivator in the Foundation Establishment Realm arrived among the families on the eastern shore, previously considered the Yu Family's exclusive domain. He seemed intent on establishing a clan, stirring discontent among the Qi Cultivation Realm families, which left Yu Mugao with a severe headache."

Li Tongya nodded and murmured, "This must be Fei Wangbai's doing... Yu Mugao is ruthless and cunning, but now he's completely overwhelmed, rendering him unable to be the usual troublemaker."

The others nodded in agreement as Li Yuanjiao clenched his fists, sighing bitterly. Li Tongya then continued, "It's always easier to harm than to defend. If the foundation of one's rule is unstable and the larger the territory, the more challenging it would be to control."

Li Xuanxuan nodded and brought Li Yuanping and Li Qingxiao forward. Li Qingxiao looked adorable with her rosy cheeks, and she greeted each elder.

Li Yuanping was similar in age but appeared much smaller, still needing to be held by Li Xuanxuan's first wife. He seemed timid and was too afraid to speak.

Li Tongya first pulled Li Qingxiao closer and stroked her head for a while, before taking Li Yuanping from Li Xuanxuan, frowning slightly.

Li Xuanxuan raised his head guiltily while his wife slowly lifted her head and spoke softly, "When I was pregnant with Ping'er, it was right when Xiu'er had his accident... It led to a premature birth, leaving him weak and showing signs of congenital deficiency."

Li Tongya first raised an eyebrow at her and praised, "Xiangping and I arranged the marriage with you and Xuanxuan back when because we admired your dignity and resourcefulness... You have spent these years in the family residence, helping Xuanxuan a lot, and your cultivation has now reached the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."

"Second Uncle, you're too kind," the woman nodded meekly, handing the child to Li Tongya who inspected him carefully. He performed a series of hand seals, and almost immediately, a pleasant fragrance wafted through the air which attracted everyone's attention.

Li Yuanping looked up at Li Tongya innocently as small crystal-like particles appeared in mid-air, twirling around in the air as before entering his little mouth. Li Yuanping smacked his lips and let out a soft hum.

Li Tongya stopped casting the spell, and with Li Xuanxuan and his wife watching him expectantly, he shook his head and explained, "All it does is replenish some vitality. With innate essence missing, only a divine ability can restore it fully..."

The woman took Li Yuanping back quietly and bowed before retreating from the room. Li Xuanxuan lowered his head and murmured, "That's good enough."

Li Tongya glanced at everyone's faces and said warmly, "Since I've broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, there are a few matters that need to be scheduled."

"Donghe."

Chen Donghe took a step forward as Li Tongya continued, "You should visit the Xiao Family and deliver the news. Don't go empty-handed; bring some spirit items from the clan, though they need not be too valuable... spirit items suitable for the Qi Cultivation Realm will suffice."

"Understood!" Chen Donghe responded respectfully and quickly left the courtyard, heading down the mountain.

Only then did Li Tongya turn back and say softly, "Elder Xiao Chuchou of the Xiao Family and I once had an agreement that if I broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, our families would form a closer alliance through an arranged marriage. If I failed, the agreement would end. Now that my immortal foundation is established, the marriage shall be arranged."

Everyone's faces changed, revealing mixed emotions. Li Xuanfeng cupped his fist and said, "This marriage arrangement will be fine if we are to wed someone. All of the Yuan generation is of age, but if we are to marry someone off, only Qinghong is of suitable age..."

Li Xuanling, being Li Qinghong's biological father, grew increasingly anxious. "Absolutely not! Qinghong has been bestowed with the talisman seed, and her talent is the highest among the generations of Yuan and Qing. How could we have her marry into another family?" he protested earnestly.

Li Xuanxuan shook his head, equally troubled. "Indeed, it is not possible... But the Xiao Family is wealthy and influential, and their willingness to arrange a marriage with our family is already a sign of respect. They would never agree to have someone from their side marry into ours! Bringing in a husband is certainly out of the question, and Qinghong cannot be married off either!" he added with a frown.

Li Tongya shook his head, setting the tone of the conversation before continuing, "Although the marriage has yet to be finalized, our family's power is weak. Logically, it makes sense to marry a daughter into their family... There is actually a solution to this."

He took a sip of tea and continued, "We can have our legitimate son marry their concubine-born daughter. Such a compromise is enough and should satisfy the Xiao Family."

"You're right, Second Uncle!" Li Xuanxuan agreed, then continued, "One more matter has yet to be reported‚ÄîThe Yu Family used our family as an excuse to kill off many members of the An Family and installed a puppet to make them a vassal. An Jingming is dead, and only An Zheyan managed to escape. He fled to our household and has now joined our clan, offering several techniques and spells."

"An Zheyan..." Li Tongya hummed, pausing for a brief moment.

"Let him come up and see me."

Everyone immediately nodded in agreement. After chatting a bit more, they all took their leave. Some went back to drawing talismans while others returned to their cultivation practice, each becoming busy with their own tasks.
