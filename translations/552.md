# Chapter 845: Palace of Enlightened Dao

Lu Jiangxian remained only as a wisp of divine sense as the two conversed. Though he couldn’t act physically, it allowed him to pass unnoticed right beside Daoist Master Chang Yun and Daoist Master Qiushui.

He did not linger. His divine sense roamed, sensing waves of magical powers clashing. Many familiar faces of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators appeared here and there.

These cultivators hailed from both the north and the south, but they were mainly Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and those Merciful Ones. His divine sense swept through the surroundings and rose high into the sky. He saw countless blue-black grand halls, some encircling lakes, and others stacked like fish scales upon mountain ridges. Clouds billowed throughout, and colorful arrays were interwoven in a landscape of boundless grandeur.

Several grotto heavens in the south had already been opened. Chu Yi had forcibly broken through Eastfire Heaven alone, thus it lacked prohibitions. Mirage Mirror Heaven had connections to many southern Dao lineages. But Anhuai Heaven was the first grotto heaven to remain fully intact till the present.

Most of the formations in Anhuai Heaven weren’t independent, but rather sub-arrays affixed to the foundational grand formation inscribed deep into the grotto heaven itself. Though time had weakened it somewhat, its structure remained firm.

These were naturally problems for the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to worry about. Lu Jiangxian, however, moved freely, and was able to observe nearly half the entire grotto heaven.

He frowned slightly and thought, Jinlian and Zhelu... where have they gone?

Those Mahas were not to be underestimated. Jinlian was a Maha of seven lifetimes, and only someone like Zipei in Jiangnan could match her. Their movements could decide the entire balance within the grotto heaven. It was of great importance.

However, even after scanning the area twice, he still couldn’t find them. Growing suspicious, he sent his divine sense to linger in Anhuai Heaven’s highest point, the Anhuai Hall. The Metallic Essence remained safely on the celestial throne. It shimmered faintly from the fluctuation of Purple Mansion Realm divine arts nearby, but it bore no sign of being touched.

There was a glowing official seal emanating quiet brilliance next to the throne. Four large characters were engraved beneath, Jiang Family of Huaining.

Though divine sense could not move spiritual items, he had cultivated the immortal technique True Insight Profound Method from Mirage Mirror Heaven. Manipulating the Metallic Essence would be easy. Lu Jiangxian could have entered Anhuai Hall and taken the essence for himself. But it would require him to reveal his true form to take it.

But how could the Upper Sect Mount Luoxia not be watching something like this? The southern Underworld specializes in gathering Metallic Essence. Could they be watching from the great void right now? Perhaps some pact gives the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators a chance to fight over it... but if I take the Metallic Essence like this, I’ll surely die, thought Lu Jiangxian.

He had never intended to take it. Instead, he continued gliding swiftly through the grotto heaven. The many formations might as well have been air as they parted before him. He soon passed over numerous celestial halls and radiant treasures, before halting in front of a tall, circular altar-shaped hall.

A radiant plaque hung above the hall, its brushstrokes flowing like dragons and phoenixes. It was clearly a dharma artifact itself, inscribed with several ancient seal characters.

Palace of Enlightened Dao.

Dharma light glowed brightly inside the hall. Jade slips floated quietly on shelves, suspended and reinforced by multiple formations. Evenly spaced and neatly arranged, they stretched along a grand brown rack that extended deep into the palace.

The Palace of Enlightened Dao was circular in design, rising higher toward the center, and divided into six tiers. The outermost ring stretched into seeming infinity, and was dotted with starlike crystalline lights that glimmered across the towering, endless brown racks.

The centermost tier was only the size of an ordinary room, and had jade slips placed upon desks. Five silver desks encircled a central cylindrical jade platform, upon which a single translucent, radiant immortal slip hovered silently.

So this is it... The full legacy of Ning State’s Dao lineage... all cultivation methods of Anhuai Heaven, gathered here!

He stepped over the densely packed luminous jade slips at his feet and landed at the center. The platform beneath him was a pale gray, streaked with crystalline patterns that pulsed faintly, like breathing.

Clearly, some profound formation was carved into this platform and still functioning loyally after a thousand years, yet it hadn’t detected anyone's presence. Lu Jiangxian calmly stepped inside, gazing at the immortal slip at the center.

His divine sense touched it lightly, and as expected, a restriction was hidden within. The royal family of Ning State was indeed cautious. Even after laying a grand formation over the central platform, they still embedded a seal within the immortal slip itself.

The restriction glowed with crystal clarity. A wisp of divine mana coiled around it, subtly connected to the altar below, and even further, to the vast formation spanning the entire grotto heaven.

Lu Jiangxian hesitated for a second, but ultimately refrained from forcefully probing its contents. Instead, he shifted his divine sense across the surrounding desks and began reading carefully.

Fortunately, the remaining manuals were evidently for the daily cultivation of Anhuai Heaven’s disciples. The formations could be unlocked with enough merit or permission. A few encrypted arts were simple enough, so he easily saw through them.

“Purple Mansion Realm techniques... These are indeed genuine Purple Mansion Realm methods...” he muttered.

Lu Jiangxian frowned as he read. All five were based on the True Essence Dao. It was extremely high in grade, and clearly part of a complete set. Their qi-gathering methods were exceedingly refined but demanded near-impossible precision. It required even the buildings of Anhuai Heaven to assist.

“At this point, there’s no way to gather qi as required... I can only take them as reference... In the end, they are Purple Mansion Realm methods, after all.”

He speculated that the central immortal slip was likely yet another True Essence technique. Losing interest, he shifted his gaze downward to the vast array of other methods and spells below.

While Lu Jiangxian quietly enjoyed the fruits of the Palace of Enlightened Dao, chaos had long erupted throughout Anhuai Heaven.

The True Monarch who had founded this grotto heaven cultivated the True Essence Dao. The sky shimmered with crystalline hues, and faint traces of formation patterns could be seen flowing downward, creating a beautiful, ethereal scene.

Yuan Xiu stood above a grand hall with a gloomy expression. The golden glow in his hand flickered faintly but remained dormant. A cultivator before him stood with arms folded, speaking in a low tone, “Senior Si, this place belongs to our Mount Changhuai.”

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Mount Changhuai floated midair, calmly watching him. Yuan Xiu’s face darkened, but not because of the hall in question.

Though Anhuai Heaven was once grand, the Jiang Family had gradually declined. Their Golden Core Realm cultivator had disappeared early on, and Anhuai Heaven had slowly faded from the manifest world. The family had already withdrawn before even the final Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had perished. Only that last Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could still enter the grotto heaven.

When that final Purple Mansion Realm cultivator died a violent death, Anhuai Heaven had fully vanished. Most treasures valuable to Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had long been exhausted, and only a few spirit artifacts and items remained. If not for the recent discovery of Metallic Essence, none of this current chaos would’ve erupted.

His dark expression wasn’t due to greed for what lay within the hall. If the Metallic Essence truly resided there, the disturbance caused by opening it would be far beyond what Mount Changhuai’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivators could conceal. Finding it first wouldn’t mean claiming it.

Nor was he upset by Mount Changhuai slighting him so openly. What truly unsettled him was the deeper message saying that his old friends had all passed. Alone, Yuan Xiu was now weak and isolated. He was no longer well regarded by these younger cultivators.

Though he often quarreled with Yuan Su and found him distasteful, if a junior had dared say such words before them, Yuan Su would’ve slapped the offender and cursed him to his face.

That idiot’s done it more than once, too...

The image of Yuan Su flashed through his mind, but Si Boxiu, his true name, quickly forced it away. He turned his gloomy gaze toward the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Changhuai. But after a moment, he said nothing, simply flicking his sleeve and leaving in silence.

He had only taken two steps when his divine power, Words of Hidden Perception, stirred faintly. Instantly stepping back, the golden talisman in his hand surged to life, blocking the beam of golden light coming straight at him.

Two radiant dharma bodies shot out before him; they were both glowing gold. One had four arms and four legs, with two faces on its neck. One of the faces was grinning, and the other one weeping. The figure held various dharma artifacts in its hands.

The other had two eyes on his face and a three on his chest. He gazed coldly, his arms arranged like a lotus bloom. It was he who had launched the golden attack just now.

“Nuzi, Five-Eyed...”

Si Boxiu was already simmering with frustration. But this incident was like a spark that had lit his fuse. His eyes turned dark, and countless tiny incantation symbols that were fine as sand surged like a river across his eyes.

His voice overlapped with itself as he snarled, “You bald donkeys think you’ve got the guts for this? Who else dares!”

“Fellow Daoist Yuan Xiu... no need to be rash...” Nuzi, the Merciful One, appeared completely calm and temperless. All of his faces smiled at once, as his voice rant out like a chant of scripture, “We can speak peacefully... All I ask is that you vow never to interfere with Li Xuanfeng again... Let me fulfill this little wish of salvation... and I shall trouble you no more within this grotto heaven.”

Si Boxiu had always detested Buddhist cultivators. Rage surged in his chest. How could he listen to such drivel? His voice boomed like spring thunder, “Keep dreaming!”

The golden talisman in his hand flared to life, unleashing a golden veil of light like falling rain. Complex runes burst forth; this was his famed Profound Yellow Dao Talisman. Yuan Xiu began to chant softly, “Preserve the talisman in the belly, draw protection from the hidden source, divine command, Conceal.”

In that instant, the radiance on the two Merciful Ones dulled beneath a veil of ash. The colorful and golden halos behind their heads dimmed, and the entire sky seemed to fade to gray. All the scattered spiritual light was drawn into the talisman.

Nuzi’s spell flickered twice in his hand. He gestured, but nothing formed. The golden blade that should have appeared failed to manifest. Anger twisted across both of his faces as he sneered, “A powerful divine art, indeed!”

He shook his arm, and the golden blade came flying out. Half of it was still embedded in his own dharma body, like a venomous tongue biting into his limb. When he noticed that Five-Eyed was still standing idly, he hastily transmitted a message, “Five-Eyed! Act with me now! As long as we injure him, the effect is the same... Once it’s done, that fruit is yours without question!”

The Five-Eyed Merciful One nodded deeply. The three eyes on his chest radiated a violet-blue glow. His expression was focused and calm, but inwardly, he was scheming, I’ve long heard this man is a standout even among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. His mastery of talismans often wounds people by surprise... I wonder how badly he can hurt me. Ideally, he’ll injure me severely enough that I can fake near-death and slip away to cultivate in seclusion.

He hadn’t joined this mess for some fruit. Yu Mujian had fallen at Moongaze Lake, and in his panic, he had miscalculated to the point of nearly sending himself to death. Now that a glimmer of hope appeared, he was filled with anxiety.

He had made bold promises before that superior and claimed he would handle things cleanly. But on the surface, he still had to seek revenge against Li Xijun. If anyone sensed something amiss, and that superior caught wind of it, he’d be done for.

After much deliberation, he settled on a plan of joining forces with Nuzi. Outwardly, he acted greedy and hesitant, but inwardly he hoped Yuan Xiu would strike him down quickly so he’d have an excuse to retreat north and lie low.

Nuzi had no idea how many mental backflips the man beside him had done. But when he saw Five-Eyed truly act, he exhaled in relief and thought, Thankfully, this idiot desperately needs the fruit. Looks like this will go smoothly after all!

Si Boxiu was in the midst of casting a divine technique when three beams of violet-blue light shot toward him. His expression darkened, and he flipped his palm over, forming a new spell as he murmured, “He who hears the Dao, void and emptiness, beware the deviant Dao, all ends in nothingness.”

When he turned his palm back up, a mass of milky-white qi had formed in it. The beams struck it, and Si Boxiu furrowed his brow slightly. He forced his hand to close around it and tossed the qi aside, unraveling the spell with ease.

The three eyes on Five-Eyed Merciful One’s chest blinked. He tried to replicate the spell twice, only to realize he’d already forgotten how to cast it. Both shocked and delighted, he shouted theatrically, “Nuzi! How is this man so powerful?! You dare trick me into fighting him to the death over a mere spirit fruit?! What logic is that?!”

Nuzi, having just resolved a spell himself, suddenly swelled in size. Many arms appeared across his body, each forming a different weapon. He muttered via sound transmission, “Don’t play dumb, damn you! How many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from that era were ever simple? Yuan Su, Yuan Xiu, Zipei and Qiushui were all titans! If he’s not famous, it’s only because Duanmu Kui and Donghua overshadowed him!”

Of course Five-Eyed knew all this; he was just playing coy, angling for more. He replied with a transmission, “I’m done! I’m done! This old monk refuses to fight anymore!”

“If you want more, I’ll pay you more!” Naturally, Nuzi saw through him and replied coldly. Though the two Merciful Ones appeared united, they were still bargaining in secret.

Si Boxiu could see right through them and sneered, “A rabble of fools!”

He was about to unleash another divine art when his expression suddenly froze. He looked up, studied something carefully, then abruptly withdrew his energy and placed his hands behind his back, face dark and silent.

The two Merciful Ones also sensed something and raised their heads, only to see a man materialize before them.

The newcomer had youthful features and wore azure robes. His sleeves fluttered, as his loose long hair swayed in the wind. His eyes were pale teal, and he was surrounded by glimmering green shadows.

He stood with hands behind his back, his expression calm and unhurried. He glanced over casually and spoke softly, “Uncle, it truly has been many years.”
