# Chapter 1112: Imperial Monarch

"Let us proceed."

A smile touched the Song Emperor's lips. He stepped forward, and the light and shadow within the grand hall shifted and intertwined around him. Blazing streams of fire and water began to flow along the steps. He crossed the hall in a few strides and passed through the doors. Immediately, a ceremonial canopy appeared above, swaying gently, shimmering with splendid white and violet light.

Palace of Orthodox Nature was already deep within the imperial court, separated from the emperor's private Taijia Palace by only the Xuanwei Hall. It was typically used for audiences with the Holder of the Profound; ordinary officials were forbidden entry.

Paved paths, known as the 'Dragon's Tail,' flanked the palace. In its center stood a 300-chi-square audience hall, dominated by a massive golden-iron phoenix that pierced the structure from top to bottom. As the Song Emperor passed through, the sound of cascading water, doused flames, and the ringing of golden chimes filled the air.

Only after exiting the hall did Yang Ruiyi dare to lift his head slightly. He saw a man in black robes standing by a pavilion. Li Jiangliang waited upon him, head bowed in silence. On the other side stood another man with a dark, sinister brow.

Only then did Yang Zhuo's eyes, usually as still as placid water, finally rise.

Within the hall lounged a beast, neither tiger nor wolf. Two lethally sharp, jade-white horns crowned its head. As it stretched, the powerful line of its spine was visible beneath overlapping scales. Its eye, turned sideways, revealed a swirl of somber golden rings. Scales layered beneath its eyelid resembled the tracks of mournful tears.

The Great Song Emperor stared, transfixed. The coiled coldness and vigilance within the beast gradually faded, and the emperor's own expression grew obscure.

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes gazed over, studying him intently.

Before the hall, the resplendent canopy floated, surrounded by high ministers. The majestic imperial robes hung empty in mid-air. Above the heavy collar, there was nothing. Only a helmet hovered in the void.

The helmet bore a single, blue-violet plume and was etched with gold on its flanks. Beneath the robes, there was no Emperor Yang Zhuo, only a suit of armor.

A long, drawn-out cry rang out.

"Announce! King Wei for an audience!"

The call was as crisp as a jade vase shattering, as clear as golden pearls scattering on the floor. The emperor and the king both shifted their gaze. The coiled beast vanished. A form now appeared beneath the imperial crown, and the formless, world-enveloping phenomenon dissipated.

The sun was setting. King Wei stood turned to the side, facing the hall, poised at the precise intersection of light and shadow. Streaks of golden-red sunset pierced through his black hair, lancing eastward and causing Yang Ruiyi to blink.

"Greetings, Emperor!"

The crimson light fell upon a blue-black imperial robe that slowly brightened in the gloom. The Song Emperor strode down from the hall and inclined his head.

"King Wei, your great victory at Baixiang Valley gratifies Us."

"It was merely by the Song Dynasty's profound grace and the protection of Martial Cultivation."

The two men moved to a high pavilion, and the attendants all retreated to its base. Only Li Jiangliang followed, taking up a jade pot to pour wine for them both. Yang Zhuo lifted his chin.

In an instant, six distinct colors of water and fire flickered to life in his eyes. The world around them seemed to freeze. The Song Emperor said coldly, 

"Leave us."

Li Jiangliang, head bowed, remained utterly oblivious, as if the words had passed straight through him. Only Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes slightly, silent.

The coldness in the Song Emperor's pupils intensified. He said flatly,

"We said, leave us."

The clouds overhead trembled. An invisible darkness enveloped the area. In that moment, it was as if heavy shadows had seeped out of the pavilion, coiling beneath the steps, waiting.

The Song Emperor's expression softened. He glanced at the man before him and asked,

"King Wei, your slaying of Vast Cicada was no feat of Martial Cultivation. It was an act of supreme courage and immortal might. Though We reside in the deep palace, We were moved by it."

The emperor, elegant and poised, raised his cup.

"This cup is to celebrate your triumph."

Li Zhouwei raised his cup and drank, a hint of a smile on his lips.

"If not for matters of cultivation, Ting Province could never have been held. How then could we have this day?"

Yang Zhuo's expression was unchanged.

"The King of Qi was once a stablehand, humbled beneath common soldiers. The Emperor of Liang once guarded a desolate border, trapped in a land of bitter cold. For one who would be an Imperial Monarch, there are cycles of rising and concealment. In times of concealment, Martial Cultivation cannot illuminate the path. In times of rising, even heroes cannot restrain them. Therefore, verifying the Dao and pursuing the Quest for Gold cannot be done from beneath sheltering wings."

He smiled, making no effort to hide his meaning.

"What you seek, King Wei, is to become an Imperial Monarch, is it not?"

At these words, Li Jiangliang should have broken out in a cold sweat, struck dumb with terror. Instead, he remained oblivious, standing blankly.

Li Zhouwei set down his cup and smiled.

"The world is vast, yet no place escapes the Wu Light. The central lands are broad, yet no one evades the Underworld's claim. This subject is indeed seeking the Dao, but even the Emperor of Wei would not dare claim to be beyond all shelter. The Emperor speaks too highly."

Yang Zhuo sipped his wine, silent for a long moment before speaking.

"At the very least, you, King Wei, have a chance to part a wisp of mist and glimpse the azure sky."

As he finished, the sun sank below the horizon. A pale purple darkness crept across the sky, and soft moonlight spilled down, bathing the palace complex in its glow.

King Wei seemed not to hear, his gaze fixed on the wine in his cup.

The Song Emperor rose and paced quietly.

"Tianwu received the Mandate of Heaven from Wei and conquered Jianghuai. The immortals submitted. He pacified the lands without slaughter, raised up immortal sects, and allowed a hundred traditions to flourish. He established the great Ning State's destiny upon the foundation of the Jianghuai King, yet he never claimed the title of Imperial Monarch. Tianwu sought truth and became an emperor; he did not seek to be an emperor to find his truth."

"King Wei, you need not worry. Great Song has no ambition to conquer the world. All lands beyond Jianghuai can be Wei territory. Unless I, Yang Zhuo, perish before I finish seeking the Dao, no one in Great Song will obstruct you, King Wei, from seeking the Dao."

He turned to gaze at the moon.

"That is, seeking the Dao. Not seizing the golden position."

King Wei raised his brows, his golden pupils bright in the night. He watched the Song Emperor quietly raise his cup, his face luminous in the moonlight.

"Ning State received its mandate from Wei," the emperor said. "We now return that mandate to Wei."

Li Zhouwei stood. He did not bow or salute. He simply raised his cup, a genuine smile spreading across his face.

"My thanks, Daoist Friend."

Yang Zhuo burst into laughter, the cold solemnity vanishing from his features.

"A fine 'Daoist Friend'!"

That title seemed a higher honor than all the world's 'Monarchs,' and a smile curved Yang Zhuo's lips that he could not suppress.

His laughter slowly faded. He stared at the moon for a long time, and the imperial mask of majesty settled back onto his face.

"Jianghuai may be small, but it spans two provinces. Shanji is also cramped, yet it festers like a sore on Jiangnan. If they are pacified, two Military Commissioners could be established, along with several immortal sects. Does King Wei have a strategy?"

Li Zhouwei's voice was calm.

"Under the Great Zhao, power fell to lesser hands. The great houses are apprehensive, and the Northern Buddhists are mired in suspicion. The sects of Jianghuai have long harbored dissent; they fear only the Profound Governance. If we can incite one or two of their subordinates, rally factions like Baiye Creek and Chengyun Gate, and lure them with the promise of Martial Cultivation, we can conquer Baihai Creek, break Shanji, and hunt down Lanyan. Jianghuai will be pacified with a single decree."

"The Qing Clan of Western Shu rules without benevolence. Despite their strong defenses, they style themselves as immortal nobility and mistreat those with divine abilities. Their followers dare not rebel, but their hearts lean toward the Song Dynasty. When the greater situation shifts, if we remove their lingering doubts, they too can be made to surrender to Song."

King Wei paused briefly.

"The Celestial Dynasty favors the Immortal Dao, but divine abilities are few. Jianghuai and the Shu region are not places for slaughter; they must be subdued. We must spread benevolence and virtue. But when this subject crosses Profound Truth Mountain, passes the Yan border, stations troops at Luoxia, and marches on the Buddhist Land... then there will be only slaughter, not surrender. We will unleash our full might and virtue, to demonstrate the Celestial Dynasty's infinite benevolence."

Yang Zhuo's eyes brightened. He nodded and raised his cup.

"With King Wei conquering the north, We have no worries."

Li Zhouwei drank his wine.

"Attendants," the Song Emperor called.

The word boomed like rolling thunder, shattering the frozen silence. The wind outside the pavilion roared back to life, rustling the kudzu leaves on the walls.

Footsteps sounded below. A person emerged from the crowd holding a tray and carried it into the pavilion. On a white cushion sat an object covered by a vermilion cloth. Li Jiangliang accepted it and presented it respectfully.

The Song Emperor said, "King Wei, look at this."

Li Jiangliang lifted the cloth. Beneath lay a brown urn containing a handful of dark, grain-like gems that shimmered in the night.

"This is an ancient object," Yang Zhuo said, "called the Heavenly Nurture Urn. It comes from the legendary Protecting Wood, a lineage that has now been severed."

"Protecting Wood is the Dao of nurturing life within wood, and this urn is a Spiritual Treasure from that tradition. Though the lineage itself has suffered, the urn remains wondrous."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. "Protecting Wood? I have rarely heard of it."

The Song Emperor gave a rare smile.

"The lineage didn't always have this name. In ancient times, a wielder of supreme divine ability verified his Dao by severing it. After that, it went through many sordid affairs, and its Dao was obscured. 'Protecting Wood' is a name later generations gave it. You won't find it in the ancient texts, which is why it's so rarely heard of."

"But it is useful. At a critical moment, it can preserve one's life-mandate. And it is exceptionally effective against Buddhist cultivators."

'He is, after all, a reincarnated Metallic Essence fully backed by the Underworld. When Yang Zhuo makes a gift, it's a Spiritual Treasure, no less!' Li Zhouwei certainly wasn't going to complain about having too many Spiritual Treasures, especially one that could suppress Buddhist cultivators.

"This subject accepts Your Majesty's grace!"

But speaking of supreme divine abilities, Yang Zhuo smiled at Li Zhouwei.

"I hear your clan has produced a sword immortal."

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"Our clan has always possessed such a heritage. It is rare for a junior to finally be able to take up the Way of the Sword..."

Yang Zhuo looked at him, smiling.

"Coincidentally, both of my sons are fond of the Way of the Sword. My eldest is rather clumsy, but my second son has already formed his Sword Origin. My third son, though young, is also quite fond of the monarch of all weapons."

"He won a great victory. We should reward him."

Li Zhouwei fell silent, understanding Yang Zhuo's intent.

'Holder of the Profound.'

'That's right. In the emperor's eyes, Li Jiangchun, who possesses Sword Intent, is the absolute best candidate for Holder of the Profound! If he were granted that high national position, he could probably frighten off the Merciful Ones in the north. Even Maha would have to reconsider!'

But how could Li Zhouwei bear to part with him?

'What's more... he carries the Talisman Seed. If he takes the post of Holder of the Profound, who knows what abnormalities might occur?'

Li Zhouwei replied,

"This subject has five sons. Li Jianglong, Jiangxia, and Li Jiangliang all serve the Celestial Dynasty to the death. My eldest son, Li Jiangqian, is older and already seeking the Dao. He has a bit of low cunning, so he remains with the clan. If he achieves anything, he too can expand the borders for Great Song. My youngest son alone is unworthy. He has gone overseas to live out his days in peace."

"The clan endures constant battle; old and young perish. The clan elders fixate on this one child. But his nature is wild and rebellious, making it difficult for him to inherit the truth. He also cultivates the Way of the Sword, and his heart cannot be bent. I beg Your Majesty to understand."

His tone was heavy, and Yang Zhuo understood the refusal. He paused, then took a step back.

"My Dao is cultivation, and Sword Intent is the ultimate, true intent. I had hoped your clan's Way of the Sword genius could come to the capital to offer some guidance and perfect Great Song's martial virtue. But I respect your wishes. In Simin, no one can harm him."

This was a polite concession, but it was also Yang Zhuo's final line. Li Zhouwei considered it for only a moment before nodding.

'I can always use 'closed-door cultivation' as an excuse. This requires careful thought.'

The emperor and the king rose. Li Jiangliang followed with the jade tray, handing it to Chen Yang as he stepped forward to receive it.

Yang Zhuo's gaze swept over Chen Yang, lingering for a second.

"We intend to seek truth, elevate immortals, and cultivate Martial Cultivation. Which is true? Which is immortal? Which is martial? Not one can be missing."

The emperor's expression seemed distant.

"However... the false and the hidden are Yin; the true and the manifest are Yang. Tianwu resides in Yang. Therefore, the affairs of Martial Cultivation fall to you, King Wei. I must rely on you for this."

"Yes!"

"This subject takes his leave," Li Zhouwei replied.

He took several steps back before turning to depart. The Song Emperor showed no sign of wishing him to stay. He passed back through the audience hall and vanished into the deep, obscure darkness.

Li Zhouwei straightened up. Without a word, he left the palace, escorted by Li Jiangliang. Once they were outside, his son finally spoke.

"Father... now..."

Li Zhouwei's pace was unhurried.

"We return to Moongaze."

Li Jiangliang was silent for a moment, then heard his father ask, "Is there any sign of a bloodline?"

He silently shook his head.

"Your son and Tianyou are both cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm. It is... difficult."

Whether it was Li Jianglong or Jiangxia, those two Wei descendants who cultivate Bright Yang both had wives and concubines, making it easier. But Li Jiangliang and Yang Tianyou were deeply in love, a perfect match, which naturally made conceiving a child difficult.

Li Zhouwei's gaze flickered. He gave his son a gentle look.

"When you have the time, come to the lake more often."

Li Jiangliang felt a great weight settle on his heart.

"Your son will..." he said hoarsely.

They reached the palace gates. Cultivators knelt on both sides, heads bowed, their respectful murmurs rising and falling. A single black carriage approached, and a man in golden robes hurried out, his black formal attire immensely imposing.

The man rushed forward, heedless of his own dignity, and bowed respectfully. 

"Greetings, Elder Brother!"

"Zhouluo, you've come."

Reunited after so long, Li Zhouwei looked his younger clan brother up and down. 

"Your cultivation has advanced quickly."

Li Zhouluo forced a smile. He looked worried, shifting restlessly. He was, of course, afraid of his elder brother. Few in the Li clan were not. And now, the man before him was also King Wei, amplifying his fear.

The flood of words he had prepared died in his throat. He put on a smile and walked with him for a short way, until Li Zhouwei stopped and spoke with great seriousness.

"The Old Master's health is failing. Find some time to go back and see him. He misses you."

Li Zhouluo's eyes reddened instantly.

"Younger brother understands," he choked out. "I went south several times on this trip, trying to ask that young grand-uncle... but he just lost his wife and is overwhelmed. It kept being delayed..."

Li Zhouwei's heart sank. "How is the old man now?"

Zhouluo shook his head grimly.

"No one dares neglect him, but he's already at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. I've spoken with him several times about adopting a junior for him. He agreed, but said he wants to wait until he's back at the lake... to choose one himself."

Li Zhouwei nodded. Li Zhouluo hesitated, then added,

"Actually... a few years ago, young grand-uncle took in an adopted son, Ning Fuchao. He changed his surname, so he's Li Fuchao now. His talent isn't bad..."

Li Zhouwei waved his hand.

"It doesn't matter. If his character is good, bring him back. We can add his name to the branch genealogy."

He raised a hand, wreathed in light, and clapped his brother's shoulder—a rare gesture. His golden eyes were serious.

"Serve well. Don't worry about home. Of all our brothers, only you..."

King Wei paused, leaned in, and smiled.

"Only you have a sliver of a chance at the Purple Mansion Realm. Do not get entangled. Focus on your cultivation. Your nephews are all bound to follow me. If I am guarding the north and cannot return... through all the ups and downs, you must watch over them for your elder brother!"

"Younger brother will watch over the clan! I won't disappoint..."

Li Zhouluo stammered his assent, watching Li Zhouwei step into the Great Void. Before the dark rift of the Great Void sealed, his elder brother looked back, interrupting with a smile.

"Do not dwell on it. The Old Master is very pleased. No one in the clan blames you."

His hidden anxieties laid bare, Li Zhouluo's face flushed. He stood frozen for a long moment, then let out a breath of pure relief. He scrambled back into his carriage.

"Quickly, to Lord Li's residence!"
