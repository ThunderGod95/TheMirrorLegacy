# Chapter 924: Profound Lake Primal Essence

The Strait of Ten Thousand Isles.

The Strait of Ten Thousand Isles was a maze of reefs lashed by tumultuous waves. Past the fragmented shoals, a chain of larger islands stretched into the distance. Cultivators occasionally descended to rest on them before continuing their journeys.

Li Ximing met Li Zhouwei on the northern shore to handle several matters. Afterward, he swiftly stepped through the Great Void. He feigned a search for a Spirit Fire, meandering through the Eastern Sea for some time to ensure he wasn't being followed. Only then, certain he was unobserved, did he follow the map to this location.

Before him lay a pair of islands, one large and one small. The smaller one resembled a deer's head, the larger its body, though the latter was misshapen, covered in jagged, imposing rocks that looked like a rugged helm.

The smaller island was called Deer Weeds (Lulai), the larger Long Helm (Changzhou). By the standards of the Strait, their area wasn't insignificant, but their remote location and faint spiritual activity left them obscure. The Li family, however, was familiar with them. The clan's history mentioned that Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong had once visited this place.

Yet, as Li Ximing peered from within the Great Void, he felt a flicker of surprise.

‘This place actually has quite a few signs of human activity.’

He turned his gaze. The island was dotted with numerous temples where monks bustled about. Although their cultivation levels were low, the place had an air of vitality. They called themselves the Earth Shelter Palace. Unfortunately, the spiritual activity was sparse, and only a single cultivator at the Embyronic Breathing stage presided over them.

This group was clearly isolated. They used the lofty title of 'Palace' yet were led by a mere Embyronic Breathing cultivator. Li Ximing descended, his gaze sweeping over them. He found that the entire Earth Shelter Palace possessed only three cultivation manuals, which, stacked together, were thinner than a quilt. As for their quality, they were so poor they wouldn't even suffice to prop up a wobbly table leg.

Stranger still, the Earth Shelter Palace worshipped a nondescript monk. They were clearly practicing some kind of 'Purple-Gold' technique, yet they claimed it was Buddhist Dharma and referred to their Embyronic Breathing leader as a 'Dharma Protector'.

Li Ximing had no desire to reveal his presence. He gave the area a cursory glance, retrieved one of their record books, and flipped through a few pages. The reason for the oddity quickly became clear.

‘My aunt and great-uncle visited this place long ago. Great-Uncle even killed a Master Monk named E'wu. The local mortals worshipped that monk, and the tradition was passed down, twisting into its current form.’

‘Originally, it was mostly earth-nurtured children, who raised mortals to cultivate alongside them. But after several uprisings, they were almost all wiped out. The spiritual objects became fewer and fewer, and the place was gradually taken over by mortal cultivators.’

It didn't look like Buddhist cultivators had set up a foothold here; it was just a coincidence. He silently breathed a sigh of relief, stepped into the Great Void, and traversed the earth veins, heading ever deeper.

He descended deep underground. Soon, the water veins and earth veins began to intertwine. Li Ximing suddenly felt a disturbance within the Great Void. He probed ahead and behind, but something felt wrong in both directions. Realization dawned.

‘There must be an anomaly in the spiritual activity here. I can't maintain my footing in the Great Void!’

So, after a quick estimation, he stepped out of the Great Void, materializing within the earth veins. Heavenly Light flashed around him, and the black stone immediately disintegrated, melting to create a small cavern just large enough for him to stand in.

This place directly faced the earth veins, and for a moment, roiling Baleful Qi washed over him. Li Ximing focused his gaze. He was surrounded by black stone on all sides. He immediately formed a hand seal, transformed into a bright light, and followed the earth veins downward. Soon, the space suddenly opened up, revealing a vast, dark, and lightless cavern.

The cavern was immense. From its ceiling hung countless pitch-black stalactites, sharp as fangs. The floor was a vast, dark lake, its surface broken by the slender tips of innumerable stalagmites rising from the unknown depths.

The cavern was saturated with an incredibly dense Baleful Qi, so thick that not a trace of other spiritual activity remained in the air. The Baleful Earth within this cave formed a complete, self-contained cycle, punctuated only by the occasional echo of dripping water.

‘No wonder the Great Void couldn't perceive this place.’

This lake of Baleful Qi surrounded a central stone platform. A deep blue halo of light enveloped the platform, where the doors to a cave-dwelling stood tightly sealed, appearing profound and mysterious in the gloomy air.

Li Ximing restrained his divine ability, lowered his gaze to look closely, and his eyes immediately lit up with joy:

‘This lake is Dark-Seal Baleful Liquid... it's a secondary spiritual item formed when a Baleful Earth Coldspring encounters the qi of Pit Water and is diluted... That means the source of a Baleful Earth Coldspring must be at the bottom of this lake...’

A Baleful Earth Coldspring was a spiritual water of the Foundation Establishment Realm. But a spring's source wasn't like other items. As long as the source here wasn't destroyed, it would continuously produce Baleful Earth Coldspring. Even if it took a long time to produce one portion, this was still an excellent find!

He didn't rush to dive into the lake. Instead, he stepped out over the water and reached out, lightly touching the deep blue radiance. A hazy black aura immediately surged forth, clearly the fluctuation of a defensive array.

‘A Purple Mansion Realm spirit array!’

This spirit array was not like the Li family's Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array over their lake. It wasn't built to be a massive sect-guarding array; it was small, exquisite, and full of ancient charm.

‘It's really still here...’

He felt a flash of joy. He extended a finger, gently hooked a wisp of the deep blue radiance, and studied it in his hand, nodding to himself:

‘A spirit array of the Water Mansion Dao. How strange. It's often said that Water Mansion is water of black and white, yet this one has a deep blue glow. There must be something unusual about it.’

Breaching this array would be no easy task. But Li Ximing wasn't flustered. He closed his eyes, held one hand before his Shengyang Acupoint, and his figure vanished. An instant later, he reappeared, a jade box already in his hand.

From the jade box, he took out a small pearl, the size of a fingernail, and held it steadily in front of him.

The small pearl suddenly melted. Streaks of stark white light leaped from it, resonating with the radiance of the great array. The array's colors immediately began to fade, and it trembled slightly.

This small pearl had a special purpose. It was condensed from a wisp of aura. Lu Jiangxian's divine sense had long ago penetrated this array, and relying on the domineering power of that divine sense, had carved a trace of this same aura onto the array disc!

Now that it was brought out, the array's radiance faded as if it recognized its master, allowing Li Ximing to drift calmly into its center. Seeing this, he became even more certain:

‘This cave-dwelling was indeed left behind by a celestial figure!’

As he set foot before the doors, he saw a plaque above, bearing three words:

Wave-Suppressing Mansion.

The tightly sealed stone doors boomed and swung wide open. Inside was a white mist, rich with spiritual activity and incomparably pure Spiritual Qi, but it was all locked in by a translucent curtain of light at the entrance, unable to surge out.

With the array undone, the cave-dwelling was practically undefended. Li Ximing stepped inside. His eyes fell upon a spacious, round hall. At the far end, on a raised platform, sat a high table. Behind it, a massive mural covered the wall, painted with exceptionally strange patterns.

The circular mural dominated the chamber, its patterns sprawling across the wall and up to the apex of the ceiling. It depicted a magnificent, esoteric scene: a giant turtle and a soft-shelled turtle entwined, a grand tapestry of interwoven black and white.

The intense colors of the mural converged, focusing the hall's entire ambiance onto the main seat. Above, the remaining wisps of black and white swirled at the ceiling's peak, casting down a shimmering radiance that shattered into countless specks of light on the floor.

Three tables were set on both the left and right sides, arranged in descending order. All the tables and wine vessels were crafted from a deep blue material inlaid with gold patterns, creating a powerful sense of depth. They gleamed with a faint, cold light, radiating an air of profound luxury.

Li Ximing suppressed his faint shock. A single glance told him the tables were made of Deep Mansion Blue-Gold. Nowadays, this kind of spiritual material was used to forge daggers and blades. For the cave's owner to use it for furniture spoke volumes of their wealth.

The center of the hall had been excavated into a circular pool, lined with exquisite jade. A spiritual liquid, flashing with white light, rippled within it, constantly releasing wisps of white mist that replenished the Spiritual Qi in the cave.

Li Ximing stepped forward and swept his gaze over it:

‘In the pool is Wall-Sinking Water, another spiritual item of the Water Mansion Dao. High-level cultivators usually use it for quenching during artifact refinement... The owner of this cave was likely no simple character. Could they have been an artifact refiner...’

‘But... I've only heard of the Secret Enclosure Daoist tradition's method of using Water Mansion for pill refinement. Back then, Li Encheng gained great renown from it. I never considered using Water Mansion for artifact refinement...’

The central table was raised higher than the others. Li Ximing, pushing aside his thoughts, landed lightly before it, his gaze sweeping across its surface.

A jade box was placed neatly on the table. Li Ximing merely glanced at it, and the moment his fingers touched it, he knew what it contained.

A Purple Mansion Realm spiritual water! A Purple Mansion spiritual water of the Water Mansion Dao!

Only a cave-dwelling of this caliber could possibly contain such a thing!

Li Ximing exhaled excitedly. He carefully lifted the jade box, first enveloping it with his divine ability before slowly opening the lid. Inside was a deep navy blue, revealing a miniature lake.

The lake's colors were varied, deep and shallow. Lotus flowers bloomed, and reeds swayed. Even more incredibly, rice-sized white egrets soared back and forth over the lake's surface, pure white and with feathers so distinct they looked alive.

As his gaze fell upon it, the reflection of a rising sun appeared on the lake's surface. Then, all the visions shattered at once, reverting to a clear, azure ripple of water—the spiritual water's true form.

Li Ximing recognized it at a glance:

cave Egret Origin Water!

The Li family lived on a lake. Although they had no Water Mansion legacy, Moongaze Lake was once one of the world's most renowned great marshes. There were countless records and legends about it, making Water Mansion items, paradoxically, easy for them to recognize!

The most detailed record of cave Egret Origin Water was in the *Two Hundred Years of Linghai Prefecture*, a book gifted by the Xiao family. cave Egret Origin Water was also called Profound Lake Primal Essence. The Snow Wings Gate once had a major upheaval over this item, so the book's entry, aside from a description, read:

‘A species of Profound Giant Turtle, commands Lake Demons. Firstborn white, red at ten years, azure at one hundred. Every three hundred years, it produces one, spitting forth Profound Lake Primal Essence. It can stabilize a lake, allowing one to observe transformations. If consumed on the new moon, it greatly benefits Lesser Yin Baleful Qi and grants an eye upon the cheek.’

Although the *Two Hundred Years of Linghai Prefecture* was a Xiao family legacy text, it wasn't a specialized bestiary of spiritual items. It only mentioned these few lines, but it was enough for the Li family to remember this item well.

‘cave Egret Origin Water... There are few profound Water Mansion Daoist traditions left in the world, making this thing even more precious. Not to mention... this is likely something that certain Daoist traditions covet desperately.’

He was thrilled. He silently stored the item in his sleeve, his heart filled with emotion:

‘It's only by this kind of chance that I could obtain an item of this grade! All those cultivators out in the world, don't they all hide their techniques and treasures behind powerful arrays? It's hard enough to kill them, let alone dream of taking their possessions!’

One had to know, this cave was sealed tightly by a Purple Mansion Realm array. While it wasn't vast and sprawling like a sect-guarding array, its quality was extremely high—small but formidable. If he had been alone, he might not have been able to break it at all!

Even if he had forced the array open, the treasure-land and the items in the cave might not have survived. Without that pearl given by the 'heavens', he would probably be staring helplessly at this array right now.

He suppressed his excitement, dissolved into light, and his spiritual sense swept out. He quickly checked the various entrances leading off the main hall, only to find them all tightly sealed. He immediately began to scan the area.

‘Where is the array disc?!’

The cave was so tidy, with no sign of disarray. It was highly likely the owner hadn't died unexpectedly outside, but had left in an organized manner. To be blunt, in such cave-dwellings, the most valuable item nine times out of ten was the array disc itself.

He had already obtained the extremely rare cave Egret Origin Water. Although a Purple Mansion Realm array was less rare than the Origin Water, its value was only a step below. Even if he wanted to explore further, he first had to refine the array disc and place his, Li Ximing's, mark on it. Otherwise, he'd be blocked at every turn!

But he looked around the entire hall. The white mist drifted through the empty space, but there was no sign of an array console. Li Ximing had no choice but to close his eyes slightly and call upon the Immortal Mirror.

He had barely closed his eyes for an instant before it hit him. He strode forward, returning to the high table. He didn't linger, but passed it, immediately looking at the massive mural behind it. He gently reached out his hand.

The back of the Profound Giant Turtle was stark white, covered in extremely complex patterns. As his divine ability slowly made contact with the turtle's shell, the mist-like white surface began to glow, revealing a deep blue, circular disc covered in profound patterns.

It was the array disc for the cave's great array, embedded right into the wall!

‘How cautious... what a method! It seems the original owner didn't even trust those who could enter the array. They specifically nested it, embedding the array disc within the array's own protective concealment...’

Li Ximing was thoughtful. He placed one hand on the array disc and circulated his divine ability. Flakes of Heavenly Light poured into it, dyeing it a faint gold. After about a quarter of an hour, the radiance in the cave flickered. The Purple Mansion Realm array had changed masters!

‘It's mine!’

Now that he controlled the array disc, the array's name and its wondrous functions gradually surfaced in his mind:

Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array!

This was also a Purple Mansion Realm spirit array, but its functions and power were completely different from his family's Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array. This array had three wondrous functions: Trial of the Pit, Spirit-Storing, and Profound Mansion.

The Trial of the Pit function was extremely odd. The array had an aperture deep underground related to Pit Water, from which a certain qi of Pit Water could endlessly surge. From what Li Ximing could see, this was almost certainly the source of the transformation that created the Baleful Earth Coldspring outside.

The Spirit-Storing function was the purpose of the central pool. Over time, it would continuously condense Wall-Sinking Water. Once the pool was full, which took a hundred years, it would condense into a single portion of White Feather Spirit Resource.

The final function, Profound Mansion, would normally gather the surrounding earth veins, water veins, and spirit veins, twisting them into a single strand to form the 'Base of the Profound Mansion', enhancing the area's spiritual activity. When an intruder attacked, it could transfer all damage taken by the array onto this Base.

In other words, of these three wondrous functions, none were for active offense. Even the final defensive function seemed perfunctory, like an afterthought. This shocked Li Ximing:

‘The purpose of this cave's functions is too obvious. Every single one was built according to the owner's will, for a specific goal. If the owner could truly just point and demand a function, and the array master could create it, then that array master was absolutely no ordinary practitioner!’

‘Condensing a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource... just hearing about such a thing is enough to make one burn with desire... It's beyond the comprehension of people today!’

It was also because the functions were so specialized. Even someone like him, who didn't understand arrays, could see that Trial of the Pit and Spirit-Storing were both built upon the final Profound Mansion function. All the transformations relied on the interaction between the local earth veins, water veins, and spirit veins. If the location changed, the first two functions would likely fail.

Comparing it again to his family's Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array, Li Ximing gained an even deeper understanding. He stared quietly at the array disc, his heart filled with emotion:

‘The family's Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array is a Purple Mansion Realm array *for the Li clan*. This one is a Purple Mansion Realm array *for a Purple Mansion Realm individual*. They serve different purposes. How could they possibly be the same?’
