# Chapter 1102: Unsheathed

On the island.

The purple light on the horizon pulsed, a coiling dragon of lightning lurking within the clouds. Rain sluiced down, drowning the courtyard in a cold, desolate silence.

Inside, the candlelight flickered. An old man leaned against his wooden chair, staring into the gloom.

Flashes of divine ability constantly lit up Moongaze Lake, and the sounds of battle were frequent. No one was ever willing to let Li Xuanxuan go out. He could only extinguish the lamp, huddle in the darkness, and wait quietly for news.

He had lived like this for a long time. Li Xuanxuan had long since accepted that he was a useless man. All he could do was wait, his heart pounding, time and time again. He would wait until his lips turned white, wait until the storm passed and the sky cleared. Then, someone would naturally come up the mountain to tell him who had died this time.

Of course, perhaps one day, the person who came up the mountain would no longer bear the surname Li. The younger generation rarely saw such things, but Li Xuanxuan had. He’d seen it back when he was still the young Family Head, and in the years since, it had happened again and again.

_Knock, knock..._

Li Xuanxuan stood up. He pushed the door open with an ice-cold hand and found someone waiting outside.

The man wore a feathered robe, a sword at his waist. His eyes were clear and bright, like the moon itself. He stood in the cold, driving rain and bowed.

"Old Sir!"

Li Xuanxuan's expression changed instantly.

"What are you doing out here!"

"The western bank has been pleading for reinforcements. I am going... but I dared not make the decision myself. I came to ask for your permission, Sir!"

Li Jiangchun hadn't seen the old man in a long time. Peering through the cracked-open door, he was struck by how dark it was inside. The faint light fell on the old man's pale, withered face. It was gaunt and uneven, his cheekbones alarmingly high. It was not a pleasant sight.

A sourness welled up in Li Jiangchun's heart.

'The old man cultivates the Pristine Water art. The life-extending pills and spiritual items the Daoist Master gave him... they mostly nourish his water virtue. The cold energy is too heavy...'

Li Xuanxuan was terrified. He quickly slammed the door shut.

"You are not allowed to go!"

He heard the young man outside the door sigh.

"A sword cultivator who doesn't kill cannot achieve the Dao. I have been stuck at the Sword Origin for long enough. I have Purple Mansion Realm talismans and secret pills on me, plenty of treasures... Who could possibly stop me?"

"Old Sir!"

Li Xuanxuan's expression was as cold and pale as his hands, showing not a flicker of hesitation. He hurriedly pulled a jade token from his sleeve, on which a single, shining character was carved: Xuan.

"The two Daoist Masters are fighting, and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators cannot easily interfere. For someone of my status, a life-and-death battle like this is a rare opportunity... It is the perfect time for seeking the Dao!"

Li Xuanxuan turned a deaf ear. He clutched the jade pendant and rushed to the door, pressing his hand against it. He anxiously tried to summon someone to send the young man away, but he suddenly realized,

'All the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are fighting on the western front. With his current power, who here can possibly restrain him?'

He froze, dazed. Li Jiangchun, seeing no reaction, finally spoke his heart, his voice urgent.

"Sir, you don't understand! Strange phenomena are appearing all over the western bank. In the main hall, the sound of life-tablets shattering is endless! My cultivation has reached this point; how can I just sit here and watch? It will destroy my sword heart!"

"For the Li Clan, I must go!"

Nothing else he'd said had earned a response, but those last words struck Li Xuanxuan like a divine ability. They smashed into his ears, leaving him dizzy, his face flushing crimson.

'For the Li Clan, I must go!'

It felt as if those words weren't spoken in a cold, rain-swept hall, but had echoed from a pitch-black cave manor, or from the banks of a surging river, or from within the roaring flames of a dark furnace.

Li Xuanxuan abruptly shoved the door open.

"You... wait."

Li Jiangchun was just about to ride the wind when the words stopped him. He watched Li Xuanxuan turn, retrieve a jade box with both hands, and bring it to him. The old man's voice was choked with tears.

"Jun'er once said the inheritance was in the sword. It belongs to our ancestors. It was prepared in the hall... it was always meant to be given to you."

"Now that your mind is made up... take it with you!"

Li Jiangchun solemnly accepted the jade box with both hands. He opened it. Resting in the center was a sword, still in its scabbard. The scabbard was wrapped in strips of grayish-white cloth, and a single tassel hung from the hilt.

'Qingchi...'

...

The rain fell in torrents.

In the mountain forest, only the dripping of water could be heard. Faint footsteps echoed as a group of people advanced in silence, shrouded by the shimmering multicolored light of a dharma artifact. They appeared to be walking, but under the artifact's power, they floated just above the ground, moving at an incredible speed.

The cultivator in the lead, his expression somewhat gloomy, spoke.

"Are you certain... this path cuts through the forests?"

A cultivator at the back, his demeanor slightly unsettling, replied in a low voice,

"Sir... this lowly one used to be a merchant traveling between the great desert and Moongaze Lake. I know both areas well. Past the edge of this desert, connecting to the western foot of Mount Dali, there is a hilly region called Nanzhang. It's effectively the outskirts of Moongaze Lake!"

"The western bank is engulfed in war right now, the battle lines are stretched thin. Out here in the desolate wilderness, there definitely won't be any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators on guard!"

The leader, a general from the Shu Court, had a complicated expression. He remained silent for a moment before saying, "I just feel... a chill in this place."

He cultivated the Treasured Earth art, 'High-Rampart Swallow', which gave him a subtle precognitive sense for avoiding harm and finding fortune. He immediately grew vigilant. At his side, a gray-robed cultivator tilted his head and said lightly,

"Nitan, this was Duanmu Kui's former seat of power, after all. It's not surprising it would have some lingering anomalies."

Li Nitan felt a bitter taste in his mouth.

He hadn't wanted to come. His family was trying to avoid getting too close to the Wei-Li alliance. But he had been forced to act as Qing Jifang's sword, and his own Daoist Master had already set an example. What choice did Li Nitan have?

'Still... since I'm stationed here, I had no reason to refuse...'

The torrential rain washed insects and snakes from the forest canopy. A few broken-winged locusts twitched and died in a puddle. Li Nitan fell silent for a moment, observing this omen, and began making calculations with his fingers.

But the divinatory art, usually infallible, simply blurred and dissipated like smoke. The gray-robed cultivator watched him and shook his head.

"Nitan, my peak also cultivates Treasured Earth. While 'High-Rampart Swallow' is the best art within that path for calculations, your Dao-Profundity is simply too low."

He glanced at the ground.

"Locusts are an ill omen of Gathering Wood. They are impossible to eliminate, impossible to kill. This relates to the Gathering Wood divine ability, 'Calamity-Spreading Life'. Seeing this sign on a military expedition is a great omen for conquest. You don't need to worry."

Li Nitan replied respectfully, sighing, "It's a true pity that such a brilliant divine ability was lost."

The gray-robed cultivator shook his head.

"My Changhuai Daoist Master once asked Duanmu Kui about it. He said that the 'Calamity-Spreading Life' path can no longer be cultivated. The Lord of Gathering Wood himself fell to calamity; how could he possibly sustain such an ability? Only if some stunningly talented figure arises to take up that mantle will we ever see even a shadow of 'Calamity-Spreading Life' again."

Just then, a yellow-robed cultivator beside them, who also seemed to be a high-ranking figure from Mount Changhuai, turned and said mildly,

"That's not so certain. 'Gathering Wood' is coveted by many Buddhist cultivators. 'Impossible to eliminate, impossible to kill'... doesn't that describe the current swarm of Buddhists perfectly? My master's opinion is... this matter isn't so simple."

His words brought the conversation to an abrupt halt. They all fell silent.

The group moved extremely fast. After weaving through the forest, they emerged to see a plain stretching before them, stained blood-red in the pouring rain. The Li Clan's forces had already lost most of the western bank.

And their current position was precisely at the undefended rear of the Ting Province army!

The gray-robed cultivator laughed and shouted, "Attack!"

In an instant, they dismissed the concealing dharma artifact and revealed themselves.

A brilliant light flared, but it was immediately met by a crimson streak shooting into the sky. It pulled a torrent of True Fire with it, condensing into a fiery red sparrow that darted forward to block them. The fire dissipated, revealing a woman.

She wore a red dress and held a spiritual sword. Two bright lanterns hovered behind her—one gold tinged with red, the other white with a burning flame. Both rained down True Fire, a truly majestic sight.

The wind and rain on the western bank were a blood-streaked mist. The water stained the hem of her red dress. Li Minggong's expression was grave.

Li Minggong was now considered a pillar of the Li Clan, responsible for guarding the rear. To run into these three... her heart went cold. Her expression turned to ice as she gritted her teeth.

"The three of you... are from Changhuai?"

The other two didn't speak. Li Nitan sighed inwardly and, knowing his place, immediately stepped forward.

"I am Li Nitan. I am only here leading the Tongmo garrison."

But the smile hadn't even faded from the gray-robed cultivator's face when the sound that reached his ears was not one of surprise, but the cold voice of an incantation:

"Great Dao Transforms Gold Dark Array, activate!"

A young man stood poised in the sky, his hands a blur of seals as he commanded a profound power. Instantly, sixteen array flags plummeted from the heavens, embedding themselves in the forest below. The ground shimmered with a golden light, and a storm of lightning descended!

_Boom!_

The gray-robed cultivator showed no fear. He merely raised an eyebrow, glanced at the attack, and said lightly,

"Rise!"

In an instant, a gray-yellow light poured down, smothering the lightning. It gathered like a dense storm cloud, condensing to neutralize every thunderbolt, causing them to dissipate into smoke.

Li Suining cultivated the Divine Sequence. His Heaven–Governing Dao gave him a natural affinity for lightning, and his immortal foundation allowed him to command it. Unfortunately, this Changhuai cultivator was steeped in Earth Virtue, making him a difficult opponent.

The man was also far more experienced. Whether at an advantage or disadvantage, he refused to remain inside the array. He brought two fingers together, and a beam of light like a spiritual sword formed at his fingertips. With a flick of his hand, it shot out, slashing at the shimmering array barrier in the sky.

_Rumble!_

A violent explosion of thunder and Metal Malice rang out. The Mount Changhuai cultivator frowned.

"Oh...?"

He looked surprised. The yellow-robed cultivator at his side, however, was full of praise.

"I never thought... in this chaotic battlefield, we'd find an array genius like this! Truly blessed by the heavens!"

For a moment, True Origin flared and intertwined. Beams of light from various arts rained down. The five of them were instantly locked in battle.

The two Changhuai cultivators—one at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm, the other at the late-stage—were, after all, from a Golden Core Dao Lineage. Even though Li Minggong's cultivation was at the peak of her realm, she was immediately forced onto the defensive, her situation perilous.

But what made her even more anxious... was the battle on the horizon.

In the distance, the crimson light Ding Weizeng commanded flickered in the hazy downpour. The enemy cultivators in the sky clearly feared him, clutching their Dharma swords and warily circling in the thunderclouds, not daring to descend.

Ding Weizeng was a genius who had risen from humble beginnings. When the Li Clan rose to prominence in Ting Province, he had benefited immensely, becoming even stronger than Li Minggong. His protective light was as resplendent as colored glass. Wielding twin rods, he fought with such ferocity that no one dared meet him head-on!

Ting Province had a good number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, but the Holder of the Profound affair had drawn away the two young masters, each taking two or three trusted aides with them. This had suddenly drained Ting Province's core strength, leaving them stretched thin.

While she worried, Li Suining's expression remained cold and hard. His hands guided the array flags, channeling the thunder. His movements were crisp and decisive, every attack aimed to kill. It was a distinctive style.

He had clearly only just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Logically, a cultivator of his age should have all their energy focused on cultivation, not on mastering spell arts. But he used them with seasoned ease, and was somehow managing to tie down Li Nitan, who had a higher cultivation.

Compared to Li Minggong's anxiety, Li Suining was far calmer. He sent wave after wave of thunderclouds crashing down, each strike appearing even sharper amidst the raging storm, forcing his opponents to take notice.

From Li Suining's perspective, even though their side was being forced to retreat step by step... the situation was already much better than it could have been.

In his previous life, they hadn't had an anchor like Ding Weizeng. And they hadn't had his own foreknowledge to provide support. The western bank's forces had been routed all the way back to the lake, not conducting an orderly, step-by-step withdrawal like today.

Even so, he sighed inwardly.

'We probably still can't hold this...'

'Li Nitan... I don't know why he's here. Logically, he should have been with the main attacking force... As I thought, some small details have changed.'

Just then, Li Minggong clearly couldn't hold back any longer. With a shake of her sleeve, a ray of light shot out.

It was a decorative screen. A Profound Mystery wind swirled across its surface, where images of Green Pine swayed. It unleashed a wave of dark-green light, batting aside the incoming attacks.

'Deep Abyss Great Wind?'

The two Changhuai cultivators' faces changed. Their gazes locked onto the shimmering screen, and they stared, dumbfounded.

'That's...'

These two were no fools. How could they not recognize what was painted on the screen? It was the Six Sons of Chongming!

'What?'

The gray-robed cultivator was momentarily stunned, an extremely awkward feeling rising in his chest.

'Am _I_ from the Changhuai Dao Lineage, or are _you_? What is the meaning of this?'

Seeing the faint, shimmering image of his own True Monarch on the screen, his face went pale, uncertain whether from anger or humiliation. After a moment's hesitation, he could only draw his sword.

"How dare you humiliate a Changhuai ritual object!"

His outburst confused Li Minggong. She paused, stunned, before understanding dawned. Without a word, she poured more power into the Chongming Profund Insight Screen, causing its multicolored light to blaze even brighter as it crashed down.

_Boom!_

The Changhuai cultivator was truly powerful. He raised a gray gourd, and a torrent of gray wind surged out, actually managing to push the Chongming Profund Insight Screen back. Li Minggong struggled to hold her ground, her head snapping around anxiously.

In the distance, a mountain peak collapsed with a deafening roar. The multicolored light of a shattered array shot into the sky, as if it had triggered a chain reaction. One after another, the lights of distant mountain arrays broke and fell.

"Puht!"

The sound of Li Suining spitting blood snapped her back to attention. The young man's voice was urgent.

"We have to go!"

"Go?"

The gray-robed cultivator was furious. His eyes flashed as he shouted,

"You think you can leave?"

The gourd swept forward again, moving at incredible speed to suppress the screen. The cultivator had been overcome with greed, intending to seize the artifact and bring it back to Changhuai!

_Clang!_

A crisp, clear sound of metal on metal rang out.

The Changhuai cultivator looked up. A young man in a white robe stood before him, sword in hand. His figure was slender, his features striking. The light from his sword flickered, pulsing with a potent sense of crisis.

Another sword was strapped to his back, tightly bound in cloth, its shape hidden. He spoke softly.

"I'll take these three."
