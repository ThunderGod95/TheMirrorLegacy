# Chapter 1164: The Siege of the Mountain

The sky flickered with multicolored light before a tide of dark, heavy fog finally rolled in. One after another, divine abilities began to converge on Xuanmiao Temple. A young man in black robes took a step through the clouds and saw a woman in purple. "How is Wenqing?" he asked, his voice laced with anxiety.

Tinglan’s face was still pale.

"Her injuries are too severe," she said simply. "Her spiritual body was nearly destroyed, and her divine ability was damaged as well… She’s been sent back to the blessed lands to recover."

Lin Chensheng fell silent at the news. Tinglan quickly added,

"Fortunately, the Emperor sent someone with a spiritual treasure. It was rushed to the blessed lands, and her condition has stabilized. That's the only reason I dared to come."

On the surface, the Bureau of Immortal Rites was impartial, but every great family knew the truth: the Yang family's favoritism toward the Purple Smoke Gate was blatant. It far surpassed their regard for even the former high official, Sima Yuanli, to say nothing of anyone else. Both had been injured, yet Lingu Lanying was simply sent off to Linhai with no further word on her condition. For the Purple Smoke Gate, however, aid was dispatched without delay.

Seeing the oppressive black qi rising from the north, Lin Chensheng's voice dropped.

"Any other casualties?"

"Many were wounded… There was one, Si Xunhui, on the brink of death… but Lingu Lanying saved him. Sima Yuanli owes her a great debt."

Tinglan answered curtly as the sky rapidly grew dark. A bronze pavilion materialized in the heavens, from which they could hear a young man below reciting a decree:

"Daoist Master Changyun, for supporting order and quelling chaos, for the great merit of pacifying Baihai, shall retain his Daoist standing in Chengshui Marsh. He is granted an honorary position in the Bureau of Immortal Rites to watch over his ancestral lands. The rogue cultivator Bai Ziyu of the Capital Immortals Dao, for heeding the call of the Bright Yang and intercepting the two Buddhist factions, is hereby enfeoffed in Baiye as King Duyè, his glory to shine upon the Martial Cultivation Star."

"Protector-General Liu Bai fell in service to the state. His merit was high and his loyalty profound, and his deeds are remembered in the Emperor's heart. Let the finest of the Liu Clan's descendants enter the palace as Holders of the Profound and inherit the title of Protector-General, enfeoffed as a Duke… Daoist Master Xianyao, who defended his lands without fear of death, is granted a Spiritual Artifact and enfeoffed as the Military Commissioner of Baihai. His seat at Overlook Peak shall be registered with the Bureau of Immortal Rites."

"The Azure Pond and Purple Smoke sects, for their meritorious service in defending the nation, shall see all their Daoist Masters within the Bureau of Immortal Rites receive an advancement of one rank and be granted Spiritual Artifacts. The Xiukui Dao achieved a great victory at Linhai and served with merit at Lake Xian; their disciples shall be elevated to serve in the Purple and Gold Palace. As for the various kings and marquises within the realm, they are all to return to the Imperial Capital to report their accomplishments…"

Li Jiangliang, holding a golden scroll, briefly outlined the rewards for the various individuals and sects. A chorus of thanks rose from the divine abilities in the sky as he finished. But then, Yehui stepped forward and bowed deeply.

"The merit belongs to King Wei," he proclaimed. "For a sinner such as myself to receive this heavenly grace brings me to tears… I dare not accept the title of king… I only wish to serve within the Bureau of Immortal Rites, and for my disciples to enter the court and pledge their loyalty to Fengzhen, to repay the boundless grace of the True Qi!"

At his words, Li Jiangliang paused, raising an eyebrow toward the carriage shrouded in black, ominous qi. An ear twitched. He then rolled up the decree.

"Your will shall be conveyed to the palace, Daoist Master. We await the Emperor's sacred judgment!"

Yehui nodded politely, showing no hint of awkwardness. Still, the bronze carriage above remained silent. The masters waited a full breath before a man finally emerged.

This person wore a feathered robe with a diamond pattern, his cultivation at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, his divine ability profound and powerful. With a deep smile in his eyes, he bowed low.

"This subordinate has presumptuously received Heaven's grace and has something to offer in celebration of the Great Song."

The nether-carriage hummed, and Yang Ruiyi's calm voice drifted out.

"Speak, Daoist Master."

Daoist Master Changyun glanced around the assembly.

"Jianghuai is pacified, but Baijiang was stolen. The war has just ended, and our masters are weary; it is not the time for a conflict with the Western Shu. This humble one hails from the Eastern Sea, and Golden Oneness is an old friend. I am willing to travel to Shu myself and persuade the tribes of the Golden Feather. I will surely talk them into returning Baijiang as an offering, securing the territory without shedding a single drop of blood!"

His declaration was met with dead silence.

Several of the masters present were still unaware of Zhang Yun’s true identity and wore thoughtful expressions. Even those from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, who might have expected something like this, now frowned deeply.

Tinglan and Lin Chensheng exchanged a look, the surprise in their eyes mutual.

'Baijiang is the last strategic point controlling Jianghuai. Now that the Western Shu has it, they won't let go until they've squeezed every last drop of value from it. Why would they return it so easily?'

The masters remained silent. The man in the bronze hall, however, seemed unsurprised. His voice held a hint of feigned delight as he said,

"Then we shall trouble you, Daoist Master. If you succeed, it will be recorded as a great merit, and you shall enter the palace as a Holder of the Profound."

Daoist Master Changyun's expression remained unchanged. He nodded with a smile, then stepped into the Great Void and vanished. Yang Ruiyi immediately changed the subject, issuing new orders for the future.

"Yehui, Zhaojing, and Qiuhu will garrison the northern side of Baihai at Changhe Mountain, which will serve as the border of the Zhao-Song. They will keep watch over Chengyun. Situ Huo, Zhonggong, and Jiuwen will defend Tangdao Mountain. Sima Yuanli, Tinglan…"

He paused for a moment before continuing in a low, ghostly voice, "You two will lead the Holders of the Profound. Follow King Wei and me. We are going to break Shanji."

The Daoist Masters acknowledged their orders, and the divine abilities in the sky dispersed. The Celestial Gate in the sea began to move slowly. At last, King Wei descended from the great hall. Yang Ruiyi, from his nether-carriage, lifted the curtain.

"Please," he said politely.

The Celestial Gate swept up the remaining divine abilities. Li Ximing sighed and, along with Li Jiangqian, escorted their king southward. The other three sons, however, followed the nether-carriage.

"Jianglong," Yang Ruiyi called out, "how are your injuries? Come up and speak with me."

Clearly, Yang Ruiyi held a fondness for Li Jianglong, the man he had personally promoted, summoning him alone to ride with him. The young man immediately bowed and entered the carriage, finally coming face-to-face with the Grand General.

Yang Ruiyi’s aura was heavy, and there was little joy in his expression. He glanced at Li Jianglong and frowned.

"Why are you so distracted? How are your father’s injuries?"

"They are not severe at the moment," Li Jianglong replied, cupping his hands.

In truth, Li Jianglong's heart had not been calm since leaving the great hall. A seed of doubt had been planted, and his thoughts were so heavy that Yang Ruiyi had noticed. But it was a matter he could not speak of openly, so he could only shake his head in silence.

Yang Ruiyi didn't press him. After a long, deep look, he said abruptly,

"Now that Jianghuai is pacified, it is time for me to lay down my command."

The words, though spoken plainly, made the young man's head snap up. A tremor went through him. He lowered his gaze and replied,

"Grand General, you have just achieved a peerless victory. This is your moment of greatest triumph. The Northern Zhao are resentful, and the Western Shu watch us like tigers… We still need you to command the overall situation!"

Yang Ruiyi smiled. He sat to one side of the carriage and pushed the curtain aside, gazing at the Exiled Qi outside, so thick it seemed tangible. The weariness in his features deepened.

"I entered the court to serve as a general—the Grand General for the Pacification of Huai. Now… Jianghuai is subdued, the Sword Gate has submitted, and the two major cultivation paths have joined the court. The forces under my command are more than sufficient to hold Jianghuai. It is the perfect time to step away."

"There will be no major wars for the next few decades. It’s just enough time for me to get out and pass this Purple Mystery trial."

"Congratulations, General!"

Li Jianglong's face lit up with genuine surprise. Yang Ruiyi simply waved it away, a profound look in his eyes.

"Whether I succeed or not, my duty from now on will be to guard against the Western Shu. All of you will be reassigned to the Huai region, each under new command. You've served under me for many years, always with diligence and dedication, and you've endured your share of hardship…"

Li Jianglong quickly shook his head, about to speak, but the Grand General cut him off. Yang Ruiyi looked at him with a complex expression.

"I'm a soft-hearted man. Since you've been with me for so long, I ought to give you a bit of advice before we part… Your destiny is tied to the matter of the Bright Yang. If you cannot overcome this tribulation, you will surely die under the Heavenly Light. Only by passing through it can you hope for a new beginning."

Li Jianglong looked up, his golden eyes staring blankly. He seemed to have never expected any guidance from the great general of the Yang family. Yang Ruiyi, however, continued to gaze outside as the waves of Lake Xian slowly faded from view.

"I have met that older brother of yours. He is also not one to bend the knee."

He turned his head slightly, his voice dropping to a near whisper.

"It is best, of course, that your father remains. But if one day he is gone, you all must find your own path. The matter of the Bright Yang is one of a monarch and a father. And as the old saying goes, 'An elder brother is like a father'… You must consider this carefully… Certain things that happened in the Wei court back then… could happen now in King Wei's court."

His words were brutally clear. Li Jianglong lowered his head. The scene from the great hall still burned in his mind's eye. The stronger his father's cultivation grew, the closer he drew to the Bright Yang. Certain omens appeared on their own, prompting a dark question to form in Li Jianglong's heart.

'If one day Father perishes in his pursuit of the Bright Yang, and Li Jiangqian finds a powerful new patron—say, he joins the Buddhists—would he slaughter his own brothers to secure his own fate?'

The answer was terrifyingly clear. He bowed his head in acknowledgment. Before him, Yang Ruiyi said no more. He stared at the immortal peaks in the distance and let out a long breath.

"The Profound Peak Gate."

There was no trace of emotion in his eyes as he watched one divine ability after another flare into existence. Billowing purple qi and the dark, cyan light of the 'Upright Wood' illuminated the sky. The magnificent Celestial Gate officially descended at the foot of the mountain.

Yang Ruiyi lifted the curtain and stepped out. He looked at the profound mountain that had resisted his efforts for more than a decade, a place he had never managed to breach. With a light toss, a treasured cauldron flew from his hand. As it rose, millions of bolts of lightning from all sides crashed down in unison. There were no calls for surrender, no threats. Only his cold voice echoed through the air.

"Attack."

…

The Exiled Qi was as thick as ink, spilling over from the north to swallow the light of the sun and moon, plunging the world into a darkness so complete you couldn't see your own hand. One by one, lights flickered to life on the mountain, providing a final, fragile illumination.

A heavy silence hung before the highest cave dwelling. A middle-aged man knelt on the stone steps, his face a mosaic of light and shadow in the faint lamplight, making him appear dazed.

Kong Xiaxiang remembered kneeling here before. It had been another dark and utterly silent night. The men from the Sacred Writ Gate had broken his teeth, and he had escaped under the cover of darkness to kneel in this very spot, trembling.

It was then that Daoist Master Zhaojing had happened to pass by. Kong Xiaxiang still remembered his words.

"Then kneel. Endure it, and you will no longer be afraid."

'Daoist Master Zhaojing.'

He looked up. There, beneath the Celestial Gate that pulsed with the light of divine abilities amidst the black fog, he saw the master in the pale golden Daoist robes. He looked exactly the same as all those years ago. Kong Xiaxiang was deeply grateful to him; it was just that the Kong family was no longer the one sheltered by the Bright Yang's divine ability.

He pressed his forehead to the ground once more, listening to the faint sounds from above.

An old man was crying.

Ever since the Profound Peak Gate had been restored, Kong Guxi had not cried. He had said that the years of wandering had drained his blood, that his tears could fill a cistern. Back then, Kong Xiaxiang had beaten his chest and promised,

"I will never let our ancestor cry again."

But now, in the pitch-black night, the old man was weeping again. These were not the tears of grief, shame, hatred, or regret from fifty-four years ago. It was a low, unconscious sobbing. The old man still felt he had failed—failed the Daoist Master who had given everything to protect the Profound Peak Gate, the man whose very bones had been lost on their lands.

His turbid, tear-filled eyes were downcast. A hot tear fell onto the golden casket in his hands, making it feel exceptionally cold. It contained Changxi's ceremonial robes, which should have been in the ancestral hall. But Kong Guxi had retrieved it during the night.

'The Yang family's hatred for me runs too deep,' he had thought, tears streaming down his face. 'When the Song army enters the mountain, they will surely desecrate my ancestral temple…'

He thought, 'I would rather die wearing these robes than allow them to be shamed by another!'

Outside, the clamor of divine abilities grew more terrifying, like the world's end, shaking the grand protective array until it groaned. Qi Lanyan's brilliant formation was only prolonging the inevitable, forcing everyone within to stew in a mixture of terror and despair.

"BOOM!"

A brilliant flash of lightning tore through the night, illuminating a woman's eyes. Kong Tingyun sat quietly before the cave dwelling, watching the apocalyptic scene unfold in the heavens.

'Even Qi Lanyan has fallen.'

She gave a short, bitter laugh and poured herself a full cup of wine. She glanced at the weeping old man, then at the silent junior kneeling on the ground. She rose, drained her cup in one gulp, and said,

"We deserved this."

Her words were a hammer blow that shattered the last thread of composure in Kong Xiaxiang's heart. He had thought that after so many trials, he had become strong enough to face anything. But now, tears streamed down his face.

"This is not your fault, Daoist Master!"

Kong Tingyun shook her head, tear tracks marking her own beautiful face.

"The Song court has hated me for years. With the gate broken, I cannot hope to live. I only pray the Grand General has the virtue to spare others and punish only the leaders."

She removed a necklace and placed it in Kong Xiaxiang's hand.

"This was a gift from the Great Daoist Master of the Profound Governance Pavilion," she wept. "It is a precious Spiritual Artifact. I thought of the Daoist Master's old relic, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, which is still with Daoist Master Zhaojing. I tried many times to arrange an exchange, but because of the divide between north and south, I never even had the chance to meet him… It was not meant to be."

"Years ago, I knew my time was short. I wanted to use this to trade for a favor, to protect our descendants, but no one dared accept it. It has remained with me until today."

"Daoist Master Zhaojing has old ties to our Kong Clan. He might be able to persuade them to spare our disciples. Let him take them in… Take this, give it to one of the youngest disciples. If the chance arises, deliver it to Daoist Master Zhaojing and beg for his protection…"

Kong Xiaxiang was sobbing too hard to reply. He knew how slim the chances were of saving the Kong Clan. Kong Tingyun, however, showed little weakness. With a tone of regret, she said,

"My only regret is that the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains dies with me!"

"BOOM!"

A terrifying bolt of lightning slammed into the array. The massive impact shook the forest, and a silvery-white light bleached every corner of the mountain. Kong Guxi's face was deathly pale. He held up the golden casket and cried out,

"Daoist Master!"

Kong Tingyun gave him a gentle, tear-filled look. She took the casket from his hands and, stepping onto a trail of brownish-yellow light, ascended. She rose through the layers of clouds and fog, passed through the vibrant, multicolored array, and came to a stop before the raging lightning.

Instantly, the lightning ceased. The black fog froze. Heaven and Earth fell silent. Cold, hateful, pitiful, and sorrowful gazes all fell upon her.

Kong Tingyun said faintly, "I have come to die."
