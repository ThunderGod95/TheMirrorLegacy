# Chapter 1038: The Killing Formation

The river's waters churned.

Along the banks, a sea of yellow-robed monks covered the muddy flats. Several squads of red-armored cavalry thundered past, kicking up arcs of mud and water. Their long whips cracked through the air, sending the monks on either side scattering in panic.

The soldiers reined in their mounts at the base of a high platform, flanked by two golden statues. One was crimson-bodied and astride a fierce tiger; the other, with a serene face and five eyes, watched them pass with a loose, indifferent posture. The Five-Eyed Merciful One sat motionless, his expression blank.

‘That damnable Minghui!’

Five-Eyed had spent many years cultivating in the north. The incident on the lake years ago felt like a dream, yet it was a nightmare that had kept him on edge ever since. He had done everything in his power to avoid assignments that would take him south, and as a result, his strength was far better preserved than that of Chiluo on the other side. But today, a deep unease—a gnawing dread—had taken root in his heart.

‘This is a disaster! I have to go to the lake again!’

He had no grand ambitions; all he desired was a life of peace and luxury. He wanted nothing to do with these life-or-death confrontations. He raised his eyes and saw Chiluo looking utterly relaxed, which made his anger flare.

“Fool!” he spat.

Chiluo lowered his gaze to look at him, a cold sneer on his face.

“What’s this? Has Daoist brother Five-Eyed become so frightened? There are great benefits to be had in this southern campaign. With the masters leading the charge, even if we can’t slaughter the martial cultivators, what’s wrong with crushing Li Zhouwei’s prestige and seizing a few Immortal Dao artifacts? It’s all good business, isn’t it?”

Five-Eyed shot him a sideways glance.

“A hundred years of cultivation, and all you’ve cultivated is unspeakable foolishness. When have opportunities like that ever fallen to us? You think that by crushing the White Qilin’s prestige, you’ll advance further in the Buddhist Land? That Maha Nuzi… did he rise to his position by crushing someone’s prestige? And Xuwang, who now sits above you—whose prestige did he have to crush?”

The open contempt in Five-Eyed’s eyes made Chiluo frown in silence. He and this man had long been at odds, but after several major battles where Five-Eyed had managed to stay detached and navigate the chaos with ease, he couldn’t help but respect the old senior’s skill—one who had survived since the era of the Great Liang.

‘In the Buddhist Land, having a powerful backer is what truly matters… Without one, you shouldn’t be throwing your life away on the front lines…’

As he was frowning in thought, a disturbance drew his attention. A fierce wind swept across the high platform, and a man descended upon it. The armor he wore shimmered with a divine glow, and he held a short-handled crimson axe. A scar on his face writhed as he spoke.

“Great Monk Minghui!”

Five-Eyed’s eyelids twitched. He then saw the very man he had been cursing, Minghui, arriving on a ray of light. His face was fair, round, and plump, like that of an enlightened master. The Maha beside him, dressed in similar attire, was older and taller, and stood frowning without a word.

Minghui returned the greeting with a smile.

“Greetings, General Gongsun…”

This man was none other than Gongsun Bei.

The general seemed amicable enough, offering a nod. But Minghui pressed forward.

“I hear the general has a treasure in his possession. With a great battle imminent, it would be best to discuss it with us… lest we act in ignorance when the time comes and jeopardize the mission!”

Gongsun Bei stroked his beard, finding the reasoning sound. He nodded.

“Very well!”

In an instant, nearly every eye was fixed on Gongsun Bei. The general held his crimson axe in one hand and raised the other, a small platform materializing in his palm.

The platform was a pale yellow, as if condensed from the qi of earth and stone. It was no larger than his palm, yet it was exquisitely detailed with iron chains, railings, and a towering central structure, all adorned with clouds of various sizes. Looking closely, one could just make out two small, three-pronged halberds planted in the circular dais at its center, every single etching on them perfectly clear.

Gongsun Bei sighed.

“This is the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform, bestowed upon me by the Profound Governance Pavilion for this occasion. It is a Spiritual Treasure of the highest order, impervious to water, fire, light, electricity, wind, sand, clouds, and smoke. Once unleashed, it fills the sky with a million rays of Dawn Qi while the Treasure Platform remains on the ground, creating a formation to trap and slaughter our foes.”

“When its spiritual mechanism is pushed to its absolute limit, the short halberds on the platform will leap forth and fall like thunderbolts, powerful enough to shatter a man’s skull and obliterate his senses.”

Gongsun Bei’s expression turned serious.

“I have tested this item. It consumes dharma power like a river, and an ordinary person could not sustain it. Its might is truly terrifying!”

“This…” Minghui’s heart began to pound.

“Are there any restrictions or weaknesses?” he asked.

Gongsun Bei fell silent for a moment before answering vaguely,

“Ah, Dawn Qi… you know how it is. Just try to use less Profound Qi and Pristine Water, and you’ll be fine. I doubt our Daoist friend possesses the kind of immortal techniques that could counter it anyway.”

Five-Eyed watched with growing anxiety. He didn’t know that on the platform, Minghui’s mind was racing just as fast.

‘I don’t know what Qi Lanyan is thinking, raising such a massive force!’

‘According to the orders from the north, a Buddhist cultivator was supposed to lead a force through the Wilderness to attack Lixia. I already had my disciple-brother accept that mission… It was a way to minimize casualties while still appeasing the Great Adoration Dharma Realm’s request…’

He and his disciple-brother, Mingxiang, had it all planned out. Mingxiang would proceed south and cause a stir in Lixia Prefecture, ready to retreat north at a moment’s notice, staying clear of the affairs at the lake no matter what.

‘According to the master’s assessment, Li Ximing’s divine abilities can easily handle me. If I bring these two Merciful Ones along to delay him for a moment, the master will have to face the combined assault of Gongsun Bei and Taixi… But although this treasure is formidable, he also has a Spiritual Treasure of his own. He should be able to hold on…’

‘Besides, reinforcements from the south are supposed to be on their way…’

With his arrangements secretly in place, he appeared to be in high spirits. 

“Look at this weather,” he said leisurely. “A fine day for a battle!”

The horse-faced Maha next to him, however, was ugly and sullen-eyed, and ignored him completely.

“Maha seems to be in good spirits.”

Gongsun Bei, the general from Zhao State, gave Minghui a perfunctory reply and turned his attention to Taixi.

“Great Monk,” he said in a low voice, “you have been away from the palace for many years, stationed in the south. Several of the great families speak of you… They miss you dearly and are waiting for your return to the palace to pay you a collective visit.”

Taixi had once cultivated in the imperial court of Zhao and was clearly more familiar with its noble houses. He had a relationship with Gongsun Bei, who was the head of the court’s aristocratic faction, and would not slight him. He shook his head.

“The matter on the lake will be trouble for the general.”

Minghui turned his head away with a faint sneer, while Gongsun Bei’s voice grew solemn.

“It is no trouble. I came south today under the command of a revered immortal. I have made my own preparations. The Great Monk need not worry.”

This seemed to put Taixi at ease, but it sent a chill down Minghui’s spine.

‘Qi Lanyan and the noble houses have reached some kind of consensus. What other schemes have they prepared?’

But before he could take another step, a ripple went through the Great Void. A Dharma Body, pure white as snow, materialized and descended upon the platform, revealing a middle-aged monk with a stern expression. A retinue of Merciful Ones followed behind him.

“I am Yanbai,” the monk said, paying his respects. “Greetings, esteemed masters!”

Minghui was deeply shaken. He looked up at the newcomer, while Gongsun Bei showed a hint of surprise.

“Great Monk Yanbai? What is the meaning of this?”

The middle-aged monk pressed his palms together.

“By order of Mount Dayang,” he stated calmly, “I am here to take over the campaign in the Wilderness from Mingxiang. I have already been to the Xuanmiao Temple to report my duties to Qi Lanyan—he said that Great Monk Mingxiang need not report back, but should instead join the assault on Moongaze Lake.”

“...”

At these words, Minghui fell silent for a moment. Down below, Five-Eyed’s scalp went numb.

‘So now it’s the First-Generation Minghui, the Third-Generation Taixi, and the Fourth-Generation Mingxiang, plus the crucial mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Gongsun Bei… Why did this person have to show up? Damn it all!’

An extreme unease gripped Five-Eyed. Each of them under the Golden Lotus Seat was capable of tying down a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with a divine ability. Minghui and Taixi were no ordinary figures, and Mingxiang was said to be on par with a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. If it were just the Buddhist cultivators, he might have held onto a sliver of hope, but the inclusion of Gongsun Bei was a game-changer. It was as good as having three mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm experts, and the general even possessed a Spiritual Treasure specifically designed to counter the Bright Yang!

He didn’t care what happened to the White Qilin; what he feared was that the master’s backup plan would require his sacrifice!

‘Even if I were to turn on them and fight back… it wouldn’t change the overall situation much… I’d probably just be throwing my life-mandate away for nothing. That bastard Qi is really overdoing it!’

‘The Lotus Temple is truly unreliable, but this is strange… Qi Lanyan is a mountain-dwelling Daoist hermit who abstains from worldly affairs. His previous arrangements for the southern campaign were a joke. How does he suddenly have such cunning? It’s like he’s seen a ghost!’

While Five-Eyed desperately racked his brain for a countermeasure, Minghui’s face showed a look of sudden realization, though his heart had plummeted.

“We have long since arranged the manpower for our assault on Moongaze Lake,” he said with a smile. “We are moved by Daoist brother Qi’s concern, but I fear we may not have enough men to spare for other tasks!”

Yanbai had a poor opinion of Taixi, but because of a private agreement between their two Ways to minimize harm to mortals, he held some goodwill toward Minghui. He didn’t let it show, however, and his reply was blunt. Pressing his palms together, he said coolly,

“It is not concern. After hearing the report from the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple, Qi Lanyan stated plainly that the Lotus Temple is prone to treachery and cannot be relied upon. He was worried that Daoist brother Mingxiang’s true priority was self-preservation, and that he would only feign compliance.”

At this, Minghui’s expression darkened, and Mingxiang’s face hardened.

In truth, Qi Lanyan’s guess was spot on. The two disciple-brothers had indeed been planning to muddle through. But to have it exposed so nakedly was a deep humiliation. Minghui couldn’t even blame the man before him for his directness. His curses were all for one person.

‘Qi Lanyan… Qi Lanyan—that son of a bitch, Qi Lanyan!’

He turned it over and over in his mind but simply could not understand. As someone of higher standing, his suspicions took a different angle.

‘What madness has possessed Qi Lanyan? His Profound Governance Pavilion serves the mountain… but surely the mountain doesn’t wish for Li Zhouwei’s death? Impossible! They certainly want this master to continue on his path, to attempt to challenge for Fruition Attainment. For you, Qi Lanyan, to suddenly insist on killing or wounding him… how could that possibly serve the mountain’s interests?!’

Minghui felt as though his head would split, but the answer remained elusive.

All the cultivators had their motives. Why was Gongsun Bei, a cultivator of the Zhao State imperial court, so enthusiastic about this southern campaign? Why was he so meticulously prepared? It was because he cultivated Dawn Qi. Just as Dawn Qi had once destroyed the Bright Yang in ages past, he stood to benefit. Furthermore, he sought favor with the Buddhists, making him even more interested in striking down the Bright Yang…

If one or two Eighth or Ninth-Generation Buddhist cultivators wanted to kill Li Zhouwei, he could fully understand their desire to seize his destiny. But why was Qi Lanyan getting involved? Everyone knew that Wei Xuanyin had always followed the mountain’s orders, using the Bright Yang to bait out the movements of the various Buddhist sects!

‘Something must have changed his mind…’

Beside him, Taixi began to laugh with schadenfreude, assuming that his rival’s scheme against him had failed. He strolled about leisurely with his hands behind his back, throwing out occasional sarcastic remarks, but Minghui had no mind to pay him any attention.

Yanbai’s arrival had completely shattered Minghui’s plans. None of the cultivators present were blind; Mingxiang’s addition would create an overwhelming advantage in the battle. No matter how much they tried to hold back, it would be difficult to control the outcome now. Worse, Mingxiang had no idea what was truly at stake. Once the fighting grew intense, he would surely not hold back!

The addition of Mingxiang greatly pleased Gongsun Bei. He gave the two disciple-brothers a friendly nod and wasted no time.

“I ask you all to lead the charge,” he declared. “I will remain in the Great Void with my treasure, ready to seize the advantage in a single strike and suppress this fiend!”

Mingxiang clasped his hands in agreement and, taking the lead, soared into the air on the wind, a hint of eagerness in his posture. Minghui felt his head throbbing, his heart filled with a growing terror.

‘And what’s more… once Yanbai finishes in Lixia, or if he’s forced to retreat from the south, it’s highly likely he’ll come to the lake to provide support…’

---

_Dong! Dong! Dong…_

The resounding beat of war drums echoed across the river. Countless battle cries soared into the sky. A man in black robes stood on the shore, gazing into the distance at the massive, mountain-like Dharma Bodies that drifted, ethereal and indistinct, within the clouds and mist.

Brilliant, shimmering light cascaded down through the white vapor, making the battle cries below seem all the more insignificant. From within the mist, a colossal being extended its limbs and revealed a sacred, radiant golden head. Its great mouth moved.

“Mingxiang of the Lotus Temple, I greet you, Benefactor!”

The voice caused the light in the heavens to fall, a cascade of overlapping colors. The black-robed man’s expression was grave as he stood with his hands behind his back, the killing intent in his eyes deepening.

_BOOM!_

Two golden palms descended from the sky, only to be bound by surging, silk-like threads of Bright Yang light. Li Zhouwei stretched out a hand, and as rolling purple flames spread, he drew forth a halberd!

In the next instant, a familiar alms bowl appeared, and the same purple-black radiance bloomed once more as karma fire billowed from within. Li Zhouwei’s gaze turned to ice.

“Taixi…”

Taixi met his eyes directly, flinched instinctively for a second, then reacted with a surge of fury. The divine ability in his hands flared brighter as he bellowed a curse.

“Beast! You still dare to resist!”

A massive umbrella of turquoise and yellow unfurled from behind Li Zhouwei, the radiance of the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella deflecting every lick of karma fire. With a twist of his halberd, he spun around. With a clang, he parried a golden sword that had emerged from the Great Void.

_BOOM!_

Mingxiang’s golden artifact had been gathering power for some time, and their clash was evenly matched for a moment. As rolling purple fire billowed out, two more golden figures materialized on either side of Li Zhouwei. One rode a crimson tiger, the other had five eyes upon his body—both were horrifying to behold. One seized the shaft of his halberd, while the other used a mystical art to lock down its tail.

Feeling the immobilizing force on his weapon, Li Zhouwei knew at once that both were from under the Golden Lotus Seat!

At that moment, the sky far above ripped open. Minghui, who had been biding his time, appeared. He held a mirror high above his head, and a thick beam of multicolored light shot down, aimed directly at Li Zhouwei’s brow!

Li Zhouwei showed not a hint of panic. His large hand gripping the halberd tightened with explosive force. Golden patterns rippled across his arm, causing the expressions of the two Merciful Ones on either side to change at once. But his gaze pierced through the countless layers of dust and smoke, locking onto Minghui’s eyes.

That single glance sent a chill of cold sweat down Minghui’s back, but a savage grin still spread across his face.

Yet before he could utter a single taunt, before Taixi’s cry of “Beast! You still dare to resist!” had even faded from the sky, another voice, amplified by a divine ability, followed on its heels. It continued the sentiment, its cold and venomous tone spreading through the Great Void.

“With all of us cultivators gathered today, how could we possibly allow you to run rampant!”

It was the Five-Eyed Merciful One!

The sound of this divine ability overjoyed Minghui. He even found it a bit strange, but he let out a guttural, rolling laugh.

“Precisely! With both Immortals and Buddhists present, you are destined to fall here at the lake!”

As the words left his mouth, Five-Eyed silently swallowed. In the Great Void, Gongsun Bei’s expression soured. He looked from Taixi to Five-Eyed, then to Minghui, his brow furrowed as if he wanted to speak but couldn’t find the words.

‘These people are too arrogant… not a single one of them is reliable! There was absolutely no need to say that.’

_BOOM!_

A brilliant light flashed in the Great Void. Grand Ascension swept out, first knocking Five-Eyed aside. Then, with a flick of the halberd, Li Zhouwei angled it to block the cascading multicolored light!

He braced himself against the Buddhist light—immensely powerful but extremely diffuse—his gaze icy. Without a sound, he broke his stare with Minghui. His Immortal Mirror had already swept violently through the Great Void, discovering Gongsun Bei lying in wait, ready to strike!

‘Golden Feather wasn't warning me for no reason… What a grand formation.’
