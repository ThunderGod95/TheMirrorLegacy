# Chapter 822: Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens

Li Ximing and Li Xuanxuan were both slightly surprised. Ning Heyuan then took out a long jade box from his hand and said softly, “As for this item, it is a gift from my Moon Lake Peak to your esteemed family, and also a token of sincerity from the Ning Family...”

He opened the jade box, revealing six neatly arranged command tokens that emitted a silvery glow. The moment the box was opened, there was a sudden crackling explosion.

Crackle...

Li Xuanxuan looked closely. Each of the six tokens bore a unique pattern and brimmed with silvery lightning. Thunder punishment aura surged out, interwoven with dazzling silver light.

Ning Heyuan said softly, “This item was originally a treasured possession of Daoist Master Yuan Su of our family. It was obtained from the Eastern Sea and is called the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens. It is a rare complete set among Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts... Since Qinghong cultivates thunder arts, I found this set to send over.”

Li Ximing understood at a glance that this dharma artifact was no ordinary item. The Ning Family had indeed paid a heavy price.

Ning Heyuan solemnly continued, “It is said this set of dharma artifacts is several centuries old. The Daoist Master mentioned it was modeled after the Sixfold Quaking Profound Thunder Tokens, which were themselves derived from the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling. It holds many marvelous applications.

“The one who crafted these artifacts must have studied the original Sixfold Quaking Profound Thunder Tokens and grasped some of their subtleties. However, limited by his own abilities, he failed multiple times. It took six attempts in total for him to complete it.

“Later, the creator reworked those six tokens and finally produced this current set, the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens.”

Li Ximing examined them for a while. Ning Heyuan then hesitated and said, “I just don’t know how Qinghong is doing now. Our peak also doesn’t have any Bright Yang dharma artifacts suitable for Ximing... After much searching, only this set of Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens seemed appropriate.”

Ning Heyuan laid out the benefits clearly, then continued to try and persuade them, “Furthermore... your esteemed family lies just north of Yue. If the Great River cannot be held... Moongaze Lake is next. Stationing forces there isn’t just for the sake of Moon Lake and the Azure Pond Sect, but for your family’s own protection as well...”

The Li Family had no real power to refuse. Ning Heyuan had given solid benefits and clearly explained the pros and cons. What words of rejection could Li Xuanxuan still offer? He could only look up at Li Ximing.

Li Ximing merely nodded heavily and replied, “I will obey the order.”

“Good, good, good...” Ning Heyuan nodded and said softly, “Ximing, depart within three days... Your family must send five late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators and six mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators along with you. As for Embryonic Breathing Realm and early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, your family may decide as you see fit. My task is heavy, and I still need to visit the next family... I won’t delay further.”

He bowed respectfully and departed, riding the wind. He left behind the two jade boxes in the hall. Li Ximing picked up the one containing the Essence Gathering Pills, examined it, and said, “The pattern doesn’t resemble a Human Pill, nor does it match the Azure Pond Sect’s pill-refining techniques. It used a few demonic creatures... likely something Azure Pond Sect acquired from elsewhere. It feels quite familiar...”

Li Xuanxuan looked up. After carefully examining it for a long while, Li Ximing exhaled softly and confirmed, “It's the Xiao Family’s method...”

Identifying the origin of a pill based on its refinement method was an incredibly difficult task. Li Ximing normally wouldn’t have this ability, but he had studied under Xiao Yuansi, and had seen all these techniques before.

“If my guess is right, this batch of Essence Gathering Pills was likely refined by Master, or perhaps even by Daoist Master Chuting himself.”

Li Xuanxuan put away the jade box containing the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens and said slowly, “They’ve become generous now...”

Li Zhouwei exchanged a glance with him and said softly, “It’s simply that Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are too scarce in Jiangnan. They’re urgently supplying the families with Essence Gathering Pills so the old family elders and younger Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators can attempt breakthroughs. Only then can the situation be stabilized by the new Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.”

Li Xuanxuan voiced the concern first. “But Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators...”

Their family no longer had as many Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators as before. When he calculated what manpower they had available, especially late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, they were truly stretched thin.

He continued, “Shamoli is already at late-stage, and Donghe must go as well. If I include myself... we’re still short by two... Sigh! Chenghui is still at the Eastern Sea and has also reached late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm by now...

“Let Chenghuai and Chengliao go...”

Li Ximing let out a deep breath and said, “Chenghuai’s cultivation is still a bit lacking, but he can reach the late-stage with a Talisman Pill.”

Only Chengliao, Minggong, Chenghuai, and Chenghui remained among Radiant Lure generation’s outstanding juniors. Now that Minggong’s whereabouts were unknown, once they obeyed this conscription order, only Chenghui in the Eastern Sea would remain...

Li Zhouwei watched for a moment, then sent people to make arrangements and carefully went over the name list. Inwardly, he thought, It truly is... the end of a generation’s strength...

Eastern Sea.

Li Xizhi and his companions rode the water veins, weaving through the surging undercurrents of the sea. Li Quantao’s Waterwall Pearl was exceptionally useful, gathering white water to form a giant sturgeon that sped through the current at incredible speed.

Though severely injured, the dharma artifact’s radiance did not fade in the slightest. It even maintained a high speed spell art on its own, clearly demonstrating the extraordinary marvels of this ancient dharma artifact.

Yu Yuwei is most likely dead... thought Li Xizhi.

Although Yu Yuwei didn’t have many years left, Li Xizhi hadn’t expected him to stay behind to cover their retreat. Whatever the reason, they now owed the old man a debt of gratitude.

Beside them, Li Quantao appeared dejected and distraught. After swallowing several pills, his complexion improved slightly, though anxiety still lingered on his face.

As they traveled through the seawater, they gradually neared the Shallow Sea coast. Faint, thunderous rumbles could still be heard, most likely from cultivators engaged in battle above. From time to time, a streak of fierce and violent sword light slashed into the water, causing the water veins to tremble. This area was near Wanyu Sword Gate, so it was likely the sword gate’s disciples.

The group was in poor condition and had no desire to stir trouble. They traveled swiftly with the current. They had originally planned to land at Lake Xian dock under Profound Peak Gate’s control. However, with the conflict between north and south, much of Lake Xian had already fallen into the hands of devil cultivators, forcing them to head further south.

However, just as they emerged from the water vein, they discovered the surrounding waters were already tightly sealed off. Not only had the route from the Eastern Sea back to the inland been blocked, but a figure riding the wind immediately approached and shouted coldly, “Cultivators from which sect? Report your names! This is Wanyu Sword Gate’s Raising Sword Ferry.”

Li Xizhi actually felt more at ease at this. After all, the Sword Gate was a strict orthodox gate. Since they weren’t devil cultivators, there was nothing to fear.

He had previously encountered members of the Sword Gate, who were openly hostile toward the Azure Pond Sect but held a favorable impression of the Li Family. So he was prepared enough to cup his hands in salute as he replied, “Cultivators of the Li Family from Moongaze Lake, we request permission to pass through your ferry crossing.”

“The Li Family?” Sure enough, the cultivator’s tone on the other side softened slightly, though a heavy wariness remained as he said in a deep voice, “Do you have any credentials? Chunyi and Crimson Reef have frequently raided our immortal islands recently. Our sect has tightened inspections, please forgive us...”

“Credentials...” Li Xizhi was suddenly a bit embarrassed. After all, their family’s name had limited renown, and showing their jade token would likely be meaningless. So he could only reply quietly, “I once had some acquaintance with Daoist Cheng Jinzhu... Might he be present now?”
