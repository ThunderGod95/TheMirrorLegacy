# Chapter 920: Autumn Moon’s Harmonious Echo

Flames surged beneath his feet as Guo Hongkang skimmed across the surface of the Eastern Sea, evaporating mist into the air. He was clearly anxious, his gaze sweeping back and forth over the sea.

The woman beside him was still frowning and complaining, but Guo Hongkang paid her no mind. He had grown familiar with her during their journey and knew it was best to simply ignore her.

I’ve long heard of Guo Hongyao’s name... she truly is someone who won’t listen to anyone, thought Guo Hongkang.

Guo Hongyao’s status was far nobler than his. Her father was a legitimate descendant of the Purple Mansion Realm, though her mother was a mortal, which made her somewhat unwelcome. Fortunately, her elder brothers doted on her. Truthfully speaking, Guo Hongkang’s cultivation resources for the year couldn’t match what she received in a single month.

Born above thousands, yet with the temperament of a spoiled noble daughter.

In Guo Hongkang’s eyes, Guo Hongyao had brought it all upon herself. First, she had flown into a wild temper and inexplicably broken off her engagement with Xi Chang of Chunyi Dao Gate. The man's grandfather had just emerged with divine powers and made him the sect’s young master, so everyone now looked at her with mocking eyes.

Then she managed several islands and completely ruined their businesses. When she was sent to the Li Family to investigate Xu Xiao, she suddenly drew her sword and pointed it at their young master’s throat!

So she had been ordered to return to the Eastern Sea. Guo Hongkang heard that Daoist Master Junjian had seized her Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact. The matter had then escalated up to Daoist Master Tianwan, who slapped her publicly and banished her from the island.

A Purple Mansion Realm immortal descendant, and beautiful too... if she doesn’t speak, everyone thinks she’s a fairy. But once she does, all pity her. A background others can only envy, yet she acts this foolishly—how can someone like this even exist!

Guo Hongkang’s own branch had long declined. He had dreamed many times of gaining just a little more resources, so watching her squander everything made him grit his teeth in resentment. To make matters worse, Daoist Master Junjian had now broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, and even her brothers no longer dared to protect her...

Where has elder brother gone...

Most of her complaints went in one ear and out the other, but this particular line struck Guo Hongkang’s heart and made him frown as well.

Guo Hongkang wasn’t particularly strong. Escorting a Purple Mansion Realm item like the Radiant Sky Stone would usually never be entrusted to just him and Guo Hongyao. The true leader of the mission was the capable Guo Hongjian; they were merely tagging along.

But for some reason, that morning, Guo Hongjian had left behind a talisman, exited the formation, and instructed the two of them to escort the item first. Then, he simply flew off!

Guo Hongkang instantly felt troubled. Worse still, he had Guo Hongyao beside him, someone who wouldn’t listen to reason. A vague sense of unease crept up inside him, Better not follow this madwoman... or we might end up suffering some unforeseen disaster...

Guo Hongyao, seeing that her companion was still not responding, didn’t show any anger. She simply thought this man had been this dull the whole trip and was probably one of those fools who buried themselves in spell studies. Her tone softened, and she looked toward the sea.

"Hm?"

She saw frost and snow sweeping in from the east. A striking young man in white, carrying a sword, walked upon the snow. Her eyes were instantly drawn to him. Guo Hongyao couldn’t help but take a second look, and then suddenly froze.

It's him!

A sudden, inexplicable fury rose in her heart, and the slight good mood she was in had vanished instantly. Gritting her teeth, she said coldly, "So it’s you. Quite fortunate of you to manage to break through even in that tiny family..."

Guo Hongkang was also captivated by the sword cultivator. The phrase 'what a handsome young man' had just reached his throat when he heard a metallic clang.

Guo Hongyao drew her crimson command token in fury and charged forward without a word.

"Ah?" Guo Hongkang rushed to block her and asked, "My lady, what are you..."

"Move!" Guo Hongyao sent her red skirt sweeping forward with a shout, forcing him to step back. The exchange drew the attention to the white-robed youth in the distance. His perception technique seemed remarkable.

Guo Hongyao had planned to approach quietly, but Guo Hongkang’s interference had alerted Li Xijun. Her fury instantly spilled over onto Guo Hongkang as she snapped, "I’ll deal with you later!"

Guo Hongkang dared not offend her. He stepped back in fright as Guo Hongyao raised her flaming token, surging Merging Fire rising with fury across her delicate face. She charged straight toward the snowy figure.

"Fellow Daoist, what is the meaning of this?!" The white-robed youth asked in surprise, strands of cold light forming in his hand to block her.

Guo Hongyao urged the Merging Fire forward and spat hatefully, "Li Xijun, you ruined my Crimson Reef affair that year... I spared your life for Azure Pond Sect’s sake... and you still dare to wander the Eastern Sea!"

Her words exploded in Guo Hongkang’s ears like thunder. He felt the breath leave his body as he exclaimed in shock, "He’s from the Moongaze Li Family!"

The Moongaze Li Family indeed lacked a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but anyone who asked would know that their in-law was Daoist Master Chuting, who had carved his path between the Three Sects and Seven Gates. Moreover, the immortal bow of Mount Bianyan had just fallen in battle for the Azure Pond Sect, and the Si Family patriarch had personally given them their rewards.

Their influence was peaking... and now she wanted to kill one of their direct descendant?

Guo Hongyao dared strike, but he did not, and had no reason to. He simply followed behind, and said with a bitter sigh, "My lady..."

Guo Hongyao ignored him completely. Though she was foolish, she was still a Crimson Reef direct descendant. The gray, ferocious Merging Fire in her hand was no ordinary spell to defend against.

Li Xijun practiced the Dao of Frost and Snow, which was naturally incompatible with fire. His mana and techniques were inferior. His spell, Slaughter Jun Kui Light, barely reached the lower threshold of major sects. The thread-like cold light evaporated before Merging Fire, which forced him to retreat several steps.

"Trifling tricks!"

Guo Hongyao rejoiced when she saw that his cultivation and mana were beneath hers, and that his Immortal Foundation was restrained by her Merging Fire. Stepping forward, her worries vanished, and she surged ahead with commanding flames.

Li Xijun exchanged a few spells with her and drew his sword to defend. His sword qi had some strength but could only split the fire briefly before fading.

Guo Hongyao pressed forward through the sword qi, sneering, "So this is all the sword immortal clans amount to!"

Li Xijun calmly retreated with his sword. When Guo Hongyao rose to give chase, the flustered Guo Hongkang panicked and shouted, "My lady, be careful of a trap! The spirit item... the spirit item!"

Guo Hongyao shot him an impatient glance, flung her sleeve, and tossed the pitch-black jade box into Guo Hongkang’s hands using her mana.

She flew forward, wreathed in flames, leaving behind only a sentence, "Keep it safe!"

Guo Hongkang hurried to catch it, checked it quickly, and finally breathed a sigh of relief. His heart, filled with dread, began to settle, Thank goodness... it probably wasn’t a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability! Otherwise, she wouldn’t have remembered to hand me the item... if she kills Li Xijun, the Li Family will hate me too...

Guo Hongyao surged forward on flames. Though the white-robed youth before her was lacking in cultivation, his escape light was surprisingly fast. Perhaps he had taken some spiritual pill, it would explain why she couldn’t catch up to him for the moment.

"Run... run!" She felt exhilarated as she rode fire all the way. Li Xijun traveled ahead on frost, deep in thought, She’s certainly no weakling. At the very least, this speed is beyond the norm.

Li Xijun had rushed ahead and, as expected, ran into the two of them, confirming his guess. Now, after flying dozens of kilometers, he noticed Guo Hongyao was still chasing relentlessly, drawing ever closer. He thought to himself, She seems to have been thrown off completely. It's not likely that she will be hiding any tricks...

He slowly reached for Han Lin at his waist. The frost under his feet began to dissipate, and his speed slowed as he let the scorching Merging Fire behind creep closer until its heat stung his back. Suddenly, Li Xijun spun around and drew his sword.

Clang!
𝙛𝒓𝓮𝙚𝔀𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝒐𝒎

A streak of white light flared above the sea. Han Lin’s blade was so fast that it blurred through the air. There was a flash of bright white frost emanating from his strike, like a gust of pine-laced winter wind and falling snow rushing straight forward.

Guo Hongyao was caught off guard, seeing only a handful of snow flying toward her. She couldn’t even tell whether it was sword light or dharma light. The piercing chill swept over her, and she blankly thought, A talisman?

The command token in Guo Hongyao’s hand was no ordinary item, and its instinct to protect its master acted faster than she could. The stored Merging Fire burst forth, drawing her mana into it and forming a gray wall of fire in front of her.

But she was only a meter away from Li Xijun. Even Chi Zhiyun and Li Chejing, both sword essence cultivators, maintained the distance of a meter in battle. Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would retreat three meters before Shangyuan.

Yet Guo Hongyao stood only a meter from a sword cultivator who had formed sword essence. Han Lin could practically reach her hem. The hasty wall of Merging Fire was completely useless. Han Lin’s true blade sliced clean through it, cleaving it in half. Her eyes were filled with dazzling white snow, then she felt a chill on her neck.

Pffft!

Blood gushed from her neck as Guo Hongyao’s pupils dilated and her elegant neck was severed in a single stroke. Crimson blood sprayed along the sword for a moment before curling back and pouring into the wound.

Buzz!

The sword had come too quickly. The treasure on Guo Hongyao’s body hadn’t even reacted. Her head had already left her neck by the time the jade pearl protecting her body finally activated its mana to deflect the sword.

The shock and panic in Guo Hongyao’s eyes had yet to fade when Li Xijun’s sword technique reversed. Three strands of snowy light slipped out of the blade, drifting and gliding toward her.

The three nimble, cunning streaks of snow darted toward her Qihai, Shenyang, and Juque acupoints. Though Guo Hongyao’s head was still suspended midair, she managed to react, shoving her long command token forward to block.

She bit down on her lip, causing blood to stain silver teeth and then transform into gray fire that was carried forward with her breath. This gray fire was several times denser than before. Its aura was overwhelming as it surged toward the three streaks of sword light.

But the Threefold Moonlight was inherently agile and cunning. It deftly dodged the gray fire and clashed with her life-preserving protective light with a metallic ring. The sounds of shattering snow and ice rang out repeatedly, and the jade pearl at her neck flickered erratically.

"Thank goodness!"

In the end, it was Guo Hongyao’s lineage that saved her life. Sword Essence grade Threefold Moonlight could already destroy most spells, yet the life-saving treasure gifted to Crimson Reef Island’s direct descendants withstood it, and still had energy to spare.

Guo Hongyao finally had the chance to reattach her head. Frost and Merging Fire hissed into white steam where neck and body met. The gray fire spiraling from her token coiled around her neck, fixing her head in place.

"Damn it!"

Only now did Guo Hongyao belatedly realize her fortune as she realised that Li Xijun practiced Cold Essence. Had he used metal or earth techniques instead, she would never have had the chance to restore her head.

Hatred rose in her eyes. She reached quickly for the storage pouch at her waist, but a question suddenly rose in her mind, He gave me so much time to react... What is he doing?

Her spiritual sense was fully engaged in using gray fire to fend off the three sword-essence-like streaks, so she could only stare blankly with her eyes.

Snow blanketed the sea. Before her, the white-robed man held his sword at an angle. The slender, snow-like blade radiated blinding brilliance. Snowflakes drifted down from the sky, each striking her protective barrier with a crisp clang, like rain on tiles. The three streaks of sword light darted like fish in water, flickering in and out among the storm of snow and sword aura.

But she no longer had the strength to deal with the three streaks. Li Xijun’s sword had already fallen. Guo Hongyao’s trembling hand gripped a talisman, but her vision was pure white. She could see nothing, there was only an intense, and drifting whiteness.

Half the mana had already entered her talisman when a sword light erupted from her Shenyang Mansion, interrupting the mana flow. The half-activated talisman remained in her palm, faintly glowing.

She felt a chill pulse through her chest. The sounds around her shattered into fragments as the tip of Han Lin slid between her brows, freezing her so thoroughly that she trembled. Her consciousness started slowly fading away.

Blood flowed from her mouth and nose, but showed no sign of transforming into Merging Fire. It slid down her fair cheek as Li Xijun stood exactly a meter away, white robes fluttering. As her vision dimmed, Guo Hongyao suddenly realized where she had gone wrong.

I shouldn’t have hastily reattached my head... I should’ve fled first instead... thought Guo Hongyao.
