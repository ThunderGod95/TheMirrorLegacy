# Chapter 748: The Jiangque Generation

A pale golden vessel soared through the skies above the untamed wilderness, gliding on currents of cloud. A man in white robes stood at its center, flanked by Li Jiangqian and Li Quewan who waited in silence. At the stern, Li Wen stood guard, his golden melon hammer in hand.

Li Zhouwei had spent a single night at the Profound Peak Gate's outpost before departing. He rarely wore white, but today was the anniversary of his father, Li Chengliao's, passing. He had changed his robes for the occasion and now stood with one hand resting on the vessel's railing, lost in thought.

The Li family possessed few flying artifacts, and vessels like this were seldom used. The main reason was the sheer number of cultivators under their domain across the Eastern and Northern Yue mountains. The clan had so many members that some had to be sent away to forge their own paths, and many of these poorer cultivators could already fly on their own. For most tasks, providing such equipment was simply unnecessary.

As for the direct descendants and talented outsiders within the prefecture, they were kept on a tight leash. Their days were filled with training and duties, and their responsibilities rarely took them more than a hundred li from their posts. Few would bother acquiring a personal flying shuttle, save for a handful of favored children who received them as gifts from their parents.

Li Jiangqian and his brothers certainly wouldn't dare request one. After all, neither Li Ximing nor Li Zhouwei had requisitioned a flying artifact from the clan during their own training. Since these younger brothers weren't being dispatched to the northern frontier or the Eastern Sea, they had even less of a reason to ask.

The vessel they stood upon, named the *Quhe*, was the first flying artifact the Li family had commissioned after becoming an Immortal Clan. It was the final work of the old West Bank cultivator, He Jiumen. Among artifacts for Qi Refining cultivators, it was of high quality. Unfortunately, He Jiumen came from a humble background and knew nothing of the Dao of Transformations; the spirit vessel could not change its size, making it a far cry from Ning Wan's Ever-Verdant Flowing Cloud Boat. In every other respect, however, it was impressive. And since outsiders wouldn't know of its limitation, it was still a presentable craft.

The vessel cut through the wind, racing toward the Eastern Shore. After Li Zhouwei had stood for some time, Li Wen approached with a dark-colored, handwritten letter. He glanced at it briefly before tucking it into his sleeve.

'Kong Yu has taken his own life…'

Standing behind him, Li Jiangqian noticed no change in his father's expression. The spirit vessel, however, began to slow, coming to a halt in a mountainous region of the Eastern Shore. A moment later, a commotion arose from below as a young man on a black horse with crimson eyes charged forth. Reaching them, he leaped from his steed and onto the vessel.

"Father!" he announced respectfully.

Li Jiangqian recognized him as his third brother, Li Jiangxia, and watched with a faint smile. Their father’s voice was gentle enough.

"It has been some time. Your second brother has also returned from the Profound Peak Gate. Come aboard; we'll return to the lake together."

A wide smile spread across Li Jiangxia’s face. He bowed to Li Jiangqian and Li Quewan. "It has been too long, Elder Brother. I have missed you dearly."

Li Jiangqian had spent a fair amount of time with his second brother, Li Jianglong, but had only met Li Jiangxia a few times. It truly had been a long while.

He returned the smile. "Third Brother, your cultivation has improved. You must practice diligently during the Qi Refining realm. How are your techniques coming along? Your Dao foundation is paramount, so you should seize the time to master some protective arts. It will be a great benefit when you break through to Foundation Establishment!"

Li Jiangxia raised an eyebrow, his own smile unwavering. "The clan's affairs are numerous, and Elder Brother must be exhausted from managing them, yet you still think of me… Thank you for your concern. I will remember your words."

They left it at that. Li Zhouwei had heard the exchange but said nothing. The vessel sped onward, and soon Moongaze Lake appeared on the horizon. Li Quewan, after much deliberation, finally spoke.

"Patriarch… regarding the scrying for the Profound Peak Gate's direct disciples, I'm afraid it will be quite difficult. My shamanic arts are already stretched to their limits when divining for Foundation Establishment cultivators. For those breaking through to the Purple Mansion realm, the task is harder still…"

Everyone present had understood that Li Ximing's earlier talk of personal effects was related to divination. Li Zhouwei, however, knew the Daoist Master had simply used the Immortal Mirror and was looking for an excuse. "Do not worry," he replied. "A Daoist Master will be asked to handle this. You need not trouble yourself."

Relieved, Li Quewan stepped back. When the spirit vessel landed smoothly within the prefecture, Li Jiangqian followed close behind Li Zhouwei into the main hall. As they walked down a corridor, they saw a man in a black robe standing before the hall's entrance.

The man stood with his head bowed, a string of jade tied at his waist. It took Li Jiangqian a moment to recognize his own brother, Li Jianglong.

In the past two years, he had matured. The last traces of his immaturity had faded, his golden eyes and long brows set in a face that held the magnanimity of the Chen clan. His entire demeanor had changed, making him seem far more docile.

Li Zhouwei took the main seat. Li Jiangqian moved to stand at his left and heard his father command, "Bring Liang'er and Nian'er."

Li Jiangqian continued to observe Li Jianglong, who had retreated to a corner and bowed without a word, his gaze fixed on the floor—a stark contrast to Li Jiangxia's cheerful and forthright manner.

Below, Li Jiangxia was already reporting on matters concerning the Eastern Shore. Since these reports had already been submitted to the prefecture, Li Jiangqian listened with only half an ear. He had to admit, his third brother was quite capable. With the full support Li Jiangqian had provided him, along with the dispatch of several of the Li family’s most competent members, the chaotic Eastern Shore had been brought firmly under control. The various families had submitted, and their direct heirs had been sent to the Secret Forest.

Just as he finished his report, Li Jiangliang and Li Jiangnian entered the hall. Li Jiangqian’s appraising gaze swept over them. The one in front, Li Jiangliang, had a pair of golden eyes and a handsome, clever face. He fell to his knees before the throne and respectfully called out, "Father."

There was nothing unusual about his brother's appearance, and Li Jiangqian's eyes merely slid past his fourth brother, Li Jiangliang, to land on Li Jiangnian, who followed behind.

The young man's pupils dilated slightly. For the first time, an emotion other than his usual calm assessment—pure astonishment—flickered across his face. He wasn't the only one. With the exception of Li Zhouwei and Li Jiangnian himself, everyone in the hall seemed to stop breathing for a split second.

The boy's eyebrows were faint, his cheekbones alarmingly high, and his chin sharp, with the skin stretched taut across his face. If Li Jianglong, the plainest of the Jiangque generation, could at least be called kindly-featured, it was difficult to find a single redeeming quality in Li Jiangnian's appearance.

But Li Jiangqian was not one to judge by looks. His attention wasn't on his youngest brother's face at all. With a jolt, his gaze locked onto the eyes beneath Li Jiangnian's lashes, his hand clenching and unclenching at his side.

They were a pair of bewildered, gray eyes.

Li Jiangliang's voice was still echoing in the hall as Li Zhouwei asked him a few concerned questions, but no one was paying him any attention. All eyes were fixed on Li Jiangnian. The child seemed slow to react, completely oblivious to the scrutiny as he watched his brother answer their father’s questions.

After a few more questions for his fourth son, Li Zhouwei finally turned his attention. "Jiangnian, what is your cultivation level now?"

Li Jiangnian's eyes were slightly uneven in size, giving him a somewhat comical look. Nerves made tears well up instantly, and he choked out, "The… the second layer of Embryonic Breathing."

As he had only just begun his cultivation, this was a bit lower than Li Jiangliang's level, but not terrible. Yet a heavy silence fell over his brothers. Li Jiangliang stood properly at the front, the contrast between them painfully sharp. Li Zhouwei looked away.

"I have summoned you today for two reasons," he began. "First, to inquire about your cultivation and see your progress. Second, as I am about to enter seclusion, I have some instructions for you."

Li Zhouwei's cultivation was already at a level where he could attempt a breakthrough to the late stage of Foundation Establishment. With Li Ximing's new arrangements for the Profound Peak Gate and the confirmation that Shanji Prefecture would be abandoned, there was no longer any reason to wait.

He first looked to Li Jiangqian. "Jiangqian, you are at the eighth layer of Qi Refining and already have the confidence to attempt your breakthrough. For now, continue to polish your cultivation and practice your techniques. You will remain in charge of the prefecture. Your Uncle Chenghuai is shifting his focus to cultivation, and Zhouluo has taken charge of Mount Qingdu. The clan has many affairs to attend to, so you and your uncle must consult with each other often."

Li Jiangqian bowed deeply.

His father continued, "Jianglong, your cultivation has progressed these past two years, and you have studied many of the Profound Peak Gate’s techniques. You will go to the Funan territory and take over the positions of Fei Qingyi and Li Anshuo. They will be under your command. You are to report to the elder of Minggong Palace."

At these words, Li Jiangxia let out a quiet sigh of relief. He was currently managing the families of the Eastern Shore under the jurisdiction of the Secret Forest, where he had also established a palace. He was, for all intents and purposes, the forest's superior. His greatest fear had been that Li Jianglong would be given control of the Secret Forest, which would have meant handing over all his hard-won efforts.

Li Jianglong accepted the appointment respectfully, showing no surprise. Li Anshuo's wife was a member of the Chen clan, part of his mother's lineage. He had already dealt with the man and held leverage over him, a fact Li Zhouwei was surely aware of. Since Li Anshuo managed the mundane affairs in Funan, it was only logical that Li Jianglong be sent there.

Having settled the first two, Li Zhouwei's voice grew stern. "Jiangxia will remain in charge of the Eastern Shore. That area borders the wilderness, and its stability is of the utmost importance. Among you brothers, only you have the necessary experience. There is no need for a change."

Li Jiangxia quickly bowed in thanks. By the time he rose, the power within the Li family had been transferred from the Foundation Establishment elders to the younger Qi Refining generation with astonishing speed.

Li Zhouwei surveyed his sons, a faint smile playing on his lips. After a moment's pause, he said, "Zhouluo governs Mount Qingdu, and Li Wen will return to the Jade Court. Only the Secret Forest remains without a master. Do any of you have a candidate in mind?"

Li Jiangqian immediately spoke. "Clan Elder Donghe is worthy of this position."

His words caused little reaction among his brothers. Even Li Jianglong, whose mother was from the Chen clan, remained impassive. The reason was simple: the old man's status was high, and he was impervious to both threats and favors. He was notoriously strict with his own family, to the point that the Chen clansmen feared even mentioning his name, let alone thinking of him as a backer. He would be of no benefit to Li Jianglong.

Li Jianglong, for his part, said, "I have been away for a long time and am unaware of the recent changes in the clan. I dare not make a suggestion. However, this position is crucial. A senior Foundation Establishment cultivator should be appointed to it."

With his refusal, Li Jiangxia did not hesitate. "The position of master of the Secret Forest is too important. It should be held by a family member who is upright and honest. It has long been vacant, and with several elders away, it seems to me that it would be best to leave it empty for now. We could appoint a few respected elders to the palace council. They could handle the affairs of the Eastern Shore. Too many people can lead to disunity, and it would be more convenient for Elder Brother to mediate from the center."

Li Zhouwei was dabbing a vermillion brush in ink, writing out the orders for their appointments. His children's words caused not a single ripple in his composure. He only chuckled softly.

'They each have their own clever schemes.'

Li Jiangqian, in charge of the prefecture, prioritized stability above all else. He didn't want an overly powerful master of the Secret Forest, so a rule-abiding Qi Refining elder like Chen Donghe best suited his interests.

Li Jiangxia's words were pleasant, but his intention was simply to avoid having a direct superior who could interfere with his work. Li Jiangqian was far away at the lake, but the master of the Secret Forest would be right on his doorstep, with power over any personnel sent there. Of course, he preferred the position to remain vacant.

That left Li Jianglong. Stationed far away in Funan, he cared little about the state of the Secret Forest. However, installing a strong Foundation Establishment cultivator would prevent his two brothers from consolidating too much power, which was certainly a good thing for him.

Li Zhouwei saw through them all. "Cui Jueyin is from Chongzhou," he announced, his decision made. "He has a talent for governance, a profound Dao foundation, and is skilled in techniques. The position will be his… Jiangliang, you will also go to the Secret Forest to cultivate. You've spent enough time in the prefecture."

Li Jiangliang quickly bowed. Though clever, he was still young and didn't fully grasp the implications, but he accepted with a smile. Li Zhouwei's gaze then fell upon his youngest, Li Jiangnian, and he let out an almost imperceptible sigh.

"As for Nian'er… he will first cultivate in the prefecture. We can speak of other things when he reaches the Qi Refining realm. You are all dismissed!"

The brothers bowed and retreated. The moment he was outside the hall, Li Jianglong took Li Jiangliang's hand, his face wreathed in a cheerful smile. "Liang'er, you are so bright. That Senior Cui is a direct descendant from Chongzhou. Follow him and learn well."

***

**Azure Pond Sect, Heaven-Probing Pavilion.**

A spring rain had just passed, leaving the stone steps gleaming. Li Xizhi, draped in a feathered cloak, sat at a table, pouring tea from a jade pot. The liquid shone a brilliant green in the cup, its fragrance sharp and refreshing.

"This is Hundred-Year Spring, brewed with the rainwater," he said with a smile. "You must try it, my lady."

The woman beside him smiled back, her eyes on him as she picked up the cup and took a delicate sip. She watched as he prepared another tea, setting a new cup to the side.

"This cup," Li Xizhi said, his tone more serious, "is Sobering Warmth. It's a graded spirit item, made from authentic Qi Refining-level ingredients. It may not be as pleasant to drink, but it has the effect of calming the heart, quieting the mind, and stabilizing one's cultivation."

Yang Xiao'er took the cup, her gaze still fixed on him. "You were in seclusion for so long," she said with a smile. "I missed you terribly."

"You…" Li Xizhi began. "For us Foundation Establishment cultivators, a few months in seclusion feel like a mere few hours. And you're already missing me again?"

Yang Xiao'er sipped her tea. "And why not?"

Li Xizhi chuckled, then his expression turned serious again. "Your Immortal Foundation, the Treasured Reservoir, is formidable. Do not underestimate it. In its own way, it is as profound as my family's Radiant Origin Pass. The Yang family went to great lengths to acquire such a thing for you; you must focus on your cultivation."

At the mention of the Yang family, she paused for a moment. Just then, a figure came up the mountain path. Dressed in silver-white robes and a neat jade crown, with a magnificent red brocade cloak draped over his shoulders, was a round-faced young man—his head disciple, Quan Yuduan.

The boy was prone to dramatics. "Master!" he exclaimed, rushing forward. "That Dantai Jin has come, and he's brought Si Tongyi with him! Protector Wushao has gone to greet them. They're already on the mountain!"

Hearing this, Yang Xiao'er immediately rose from her seat. Li Xizhi, however, looked exasperated.

"I thought it was something serious," he said, shaking his head. "Yuduan, your temperament is still lacking… and so is your conduct. You do everything based on your whims. You are not the scion of some great house or the direct heir of a Golden Core Daoist Master. Who gave you so many airs? Your junior brother has already left the mountain for his training. Until the day you change this attitude, you are forbidden from leaving!"

Quan Yuduan's expression immediately sobered. He nodded in acknowledgment. The Heaven-Probing Pavilion was dreadfully boring, and he often longed to go out. "Disciple will remember!" he said quickly.

As he retreated, a man in an ornate headdress ascended the path. His cultivation was at the late stage of Foundation Establishment, and his bearing was elegant and otherworldly. A short sword hung at his waist, and his face was a picture of courtesy.

"Greetings, Pavilion Master!" he said with a smile.
