# Chapter 1186: Stars Beneath the Mountain

Within the mirror's heaven.

As Tang Xie vanished far beyond the Celestial Gate, the immortal generals in the palace drifted away like falling snow. The entire scene shifted abruptly, and the white-robed immortal appeared.

Lu Jiangxian breathed a quiet sigh of relief, his heart elated.

"The Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition… what an incredible, unexpected haul! These grotto-heavens… there's some real substance in them!"

From the myriad esoteric arts for absorbing qi and cultivating one's nature to the various techniques of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition, all were of considerable use. The piece of intelligence regarding the 'Elucidating Removal' and Daoist Master Yi Chuan’s essay, the Lesser Yin's Quest for the Dao Scroll, was a godsend.

"And what's more… there's Dongjun!"

Lu Jiangxian was not unfamiliar with the name; it was often used in many Daoist arts to refer to the sun. But this was the first he'd heard of a Sun Immortal Lord who bore that title!

'In an age where the deeds of True Monarchs go unrecorded, His existence is far too ancient. Even True Monarchs who achieved the Dao in later eras might not know all His titles. Only someone truly from ancient times like Tang Xie, a disciple of Tongxuan who followed ancient immortals, would have such deep knowledge.'

'But could this person… be the one who carved ‘Lu Jiangxian of Green Pine Temple’ onto the Sun Seeker Ring?'

Lu Jiangxian shook his head, noncommittal.

'According to Tang Xie's judgment, Dongjun is the Lord of the Sun. His conduct, if not tyrannical, is at least noble and forthright… Judging by both his temperament and his divine abilities, I doubt he'd be capable of tailing Chufu and stealing the Penglai Dao Lineage…'

'But Tang Xie’s line of reasoning is sound. If we must trace this back to the Azure Profoundity, it has to be someone from Dongjun's era. Perhaps it was a cultivator who commanded the Supreme Yin at the time…'

At first, Lu Jiangxian hadn't given it much thought, but as the Name Ascending Stone and other clues came to light, coupled with what he'd learned of the ancient cultivators' deeds, his suspicions deepened.

'That's one less candidate for the one who commands both Yin and Yang… Besides, my past life's schemes and actions don't seem very righteous. Could I have been looking in the wrong direction? Was I actually a demonic sovereign…'

'Truthfully, I'm not exactly a paragon of virtue now, either. Under my command, I have a few immortal officials. Though they're quiet now, one was a demon beast that once terrorized an entire era, and the other was a lecherous monk who reveled in pools of wine and forests of meat. And now there's an immortal cultivator who orchestrates bloody wars among mortals…'

He gave a self-deprecating smile. Inside the Immortal Artifact, his greatest priority was still to bring about the Bright Yang and ensure his own survival.

'As for Qi Lanyan and the future immortal officials and generals, I suppose it's a chance for them to attain the Dao. Vicious demons like Shaohui are another matter, but if any of my subordinates deceive good people in the future, as long as I remain free, I will help them see through the mortal dust and let them decide their own path…'

Of course, that was all assuming he would still be Lu Jiangxian then, and not some awakened Devil Lord Lu. Such thoughts were too distant. Lu Jiangxian entertained them for only a moment before setting them aside.

"Still, the name Dongjun is a grand one. It's a name grand enough to scare a few minor devils witless one day. I can also follow this lead and investigate further."

The jade slip Tang Xie had sent floated over, but Lu Jiangxian casually set it on the table and picked up another one instead.

The techniques recorded within were numerous and profound, as vast as mountains and seas. Some touched upon the unwritten secrets of the Daoist traditions, which Tang Xie hadn't been willing to write down completely. But to transcribe them from memory, he would have had to recall them! Thus, the beginning and end of each technique in the jade slip were largely intact, and including what Tang Xie had transcribed from memory, it amounted to ninety percent of the complete texts.

'There are three techniques in total. One is the 'Heart Art of the Divine Core Achieved by Borrowing Earth,' which Tang Xie relied upon to attain the Dao. Another is the 'Righteous Method of the Spiritual Treasure for Advancing Cultivation,' which he used after borrowing the golden position. The last one is rather unique: the 'Profound Art of Supplication to the Spiritual Treasure' is a wondrous technique for sensing one's Fruition Attainment and drawing upon its profundity.'

These were all orthodox ancient techniques, unquestionably the most valuable treasures within the living repository of the Dao that was Tang Xie.

'The so-called Dao of Woven Jade and Yuyi… I know a fair bit, but the version from the Chunyi Dao Gate wasn't the original text. It was written by later generations. Now… I finally have a definitive ancient framework.'

According to Tang Xie's 'Heart Art of the Divine Core Achieved by Borrowing Earth,' this method of attaining the Dao was typically passed down by figures like Divine Monarchs to elevate their retainers, allowing them to follow in cultivation. Even a Dao Embryo could only elevate a few individuals. This process was usually called 'Guided Endowment' or creating a 'Proxy Immortal.' If a full realm was achieved, it was known as a 'Divine Core.'

His use of the term 'False Immortal' was typically a form of self-deprecation. After all, cultivators valued the genuine and abhorred the false. Even if their path to the Dao was truly severed, none wished to bear the label of 'false.'

What surprised Lu Jiangxian even more was the clear distinction drawn: bestowing a Guided Endowment was a burden upon a Golden Core Dao Embryo. However, the paths of the Woven Jade and Yuyi added no such burden to the Dao Embryos of Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang. In fact, the cultivation of a Woven Jade or Yuyi Immortal was still considered their own achievement!

Hence, a special note was included: cultivators of the 'Divine Core' were, in the ancient system, explicitly separate from the Woven Jade and Yuyi paths. In other words, the ancients believed: 'Yuyi and Woven Jade are not false; Guided Endowment is not true.'

This instantly resolved the doubt in Lu Jiangxian's heart, giving him a new appreciation for the sublime status of these two paths.

"No wonder the only power publicly known to have 'Guided Endowment' positions is the Underworld… In ancient times, elevating a junior to hold a Golden Core position by proxy without just cause must have been a troublesome and demanding affair…"

But another cloud of doubt immediately formed in his mind.

He had seen the Underworld emissaries. He was almost certain that in terms of rank and power, they were a world away from Tang Xie. If he had to make a comparison, those emissaries were closer to the ranks of Maha and Holder of the Profound.

'Something must have changed…'

'It was… Li Qianyuan. It was the unprecedented Wei-Li Celestial Dynasty!'

Given the relationship between the Li family and the Bright Yang, Lu Jiangxian knew a little about Li Qianyuan. He had also heard the Dragon-kin imply that the Dharma Master had stolen Li Qianyuan's method for his Celestial Dynasty and gained insight from it. Comparing the two, a greater understanding dawned on him.

'The ancient Divine Core method borrowed from the divine Dao to varying degrees. It was rare but refined, used to create proxies. But the turning point was Li Qianyuan…'

'Perhaps the Heavenly Dao itself changed, or perhaps it was simply the supreme, transcendent talent of the Wei-Li Emperor… Li Qianyuan created an unprecedented method for a Celestial Dynasty, binding the countless masses of the northern lands to his celestial palace. He stood upon the 'Bright Yang' position with the bearing of a supreme Imperial Monarch!'

'The method was so ingenious, so effective, that all the great powers scrambled to study it. Even the august Underworld borrowed heavily from its principles. Today’s Great Song is only learning its superficial aspects, while the Seven Aspects of the Buddhist cultivators used it to complete the final piece of their modern Buddhist framework… thus beginning the great age of strife that has lasted a thousand years.'

'And because of this, the 'Bright Yang' position has remained loyal ever since. No matter how Mount Luoxia corrupted it, it remembered him for nearly two thousand years. If it weren't for the Sun Seeker Ring, it would still refuse to shift its allegiance to this day!'

As the truth gradually came into focus, his feelings grew more complex.

"A figure like that… no wonder Mount Luoxia had to go to such lengths, even allowing Li Zhouwei to emerge to help destabilize Li Qianyuan… Perhaps, in their eyes, defeating a usurper sitting on the Bright Yang throne is far easier than completely eradicating Li Qianyuan…"

"This is truly hell-level difficulty…"

Lu Jiangxian sighed, a hint of worry on his face. He changed his train of thought and began reading the 'Profound Art of Supplication to the Spiritual Treasure.'

This was an art for sensing a Fruition Attainment and drawing upon its power. Naturally, Lu Jiangxian wasn't going to use it to sense the 'Treasured Earth' Fruition Attainment. He simply held the slip and read it carefully, a thought stirring in his mind.

"What would happen if I were to modify it slightly and use it to sense the 'Supreme Yin' Fruition Attainment?"

The moment the idea arose, a sense of danger washed over him. He smiled awkwardly, a premonition taking hold.

'If I use this art, I won't need to have the cultivators outside test the Fruition Attainment with their Quest for Gold. The 'Supreme Yin' Fruition Attainment would probably manifest on the spot…'

He had no choice but to abandon the thought. He picked up the 'Heart Art of the Divine Core Achieved by Borrowing Earth' and began to evaluate his own plans.

"This Heart Art requires a Fruition Attainment to respond, or the entrustment of a Rank Designation of an extremely high order. Without a True Monarch to maintain it, the latter can only cling to a tenuous existence. Yuanshang, lacking a soul, cannot even manage that…"

He pondered for a long time before finally devising a plan.

'When Yuanshang cultivated the Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic, its ultimate destination was me. This confirms one thing: the 'Supreme Yin' position must be within the Immortal Mirror.'

With a single step, he passed from the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance into the deeper Heaven within the Mirror. He held out his hand, revealing the shimmering golden True Spirit.

Instantly, endless radiance converged, coalescing into a body of pure moonlight to grow a Dharma Body and soul for Yuanshang's True Spirit. In moments, it formed into a young man, but his eyes were shut tight, like a corpse.

It was because the hastily coalesced soul could not contain his True Spirit.

'Here in the Heaven within the Mirror, my Supreme Yin spiritual materials are theoretically infinite, and my rank is supreme. If I bring him in here, use his True Spirit to condense a soul and Dharma Body, and follow the 'Heart Art of the Divine Core Achieved by Borrowing Earth'… if I imitate how the ancient immortal Xu Xiang allowed Tang Xie to borrow a Golden Core and implant an object of supreme rank within his True Spirit, can I replicate Tang Xie’s path to the Dao?'

Although Yuanshang's True Spirit couldn't last long in an ordinary soul, there was enough time for Lu Jiangxian to complete one cycle of the process before the soul disintegrated. Furthermore, Yuanshang's True Spirit already possessed the rank of a Woven Jade, which should theoretically make the process easier than it was for Tang Xie.

Back then, True Monarch Xu Xiang had used his great dharma power to place an Auxiliary Position inside Tang Xie to raise his rank. While Lu Jiangxian couldn't produce an Auxiliary Position, he had something else he could try.

A point of light materialized in his palm.

'The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed.'

This Talisman Seed had been resting in the Name Ascending Stone, sensing things for him. As he temporarily retrieved it, a terrifyingly potent rank radiated from him. Endless moonlight surged forth, the 'Heart Art of the Divine Core Achieved by Borrowing Earth' activated, and the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed sank into the young man's brow, erupting in a flash of white light!

The white light pulsed erratically, but it was utterly suppressed by the overwhelming quantity of moonlight and Lu Jiangxian's ever-ascendant rank. Within moments, it slowly began to stabilize.

'The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed can indeed substitute for the Auxiliary Position… and the effect is only marginally inferior!'

The young man had transformed into a brilliant orb of white light, and a look of delight spread across Lu Jiangxian's face.

'Even better, Tang Xie nurtured his for seventy-one days. The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed just needs to be nurtured within his body. Once the process is stable, I can even retrieve it for other uses!'

The only drawback to this method was that everything was an illusion created within the Heaven within the Mirror. In this state, Yuanshang couldn't travel between the mirror's heaven and the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance like Dangjiang could. But Lu Jiangxian didn't need him to leave; he only needed the process to succeed. He focused on stabilizing the white light, his heart finally at ease.

'Yuanshang… once this succeeds, he'll become a Woven Jade Immortal, my strongest asset by far.'

He raised a hand and swiped lightly. A terrifying storm of Supreme Yin instantly erupted throughout the dimension. A vast swathe of the land was torn away, drifting aimlessly before shattering into countless fragments within the endless white light.

These fragments floated in the void, soon forming islands of all sizes across the sky. A heavy, primordial barrier emerged, separating the two spaces, effectively sealing that area off into its own pocket dimension.

As Lu Jiangxian's thoughts flowed, the crumbling, ash-white ruins of buildings appeared on the islands. On the largest island, a mountain peak rose, crowned by a moonlight palace that, though damaged, was mostly intact.

With a flick of his finger, the orb of chaotic white light plummeted, landing on a meditation cushion within the palace. There, as time flowed on, it began to gestate.

Only after arranging everything did Lu Jiangxian solemnly take up the 'Righteous Method of the Spiritual Treasure for Advancing Cultivation.'

'This is the first cultivation method I've obtained for the post-Golden Core stage. Though it's just a technique for a Divine Core cultivator to condense Metallic Essence and increase their strength, it's still an extremely valuable reference.'

The method was incredibly complex. Its core principle was simple: sense the position to which one was anchored and continuously strengthen one's life-mandate. Yet, for Lu Jiangxian, it felt like opening a door to a new world. With a flash of insight, he quickly formed a hand seal and tried to sense it.

'Where is my life-mandate anchored…'

A dark haze rose and fell before his eyes, and a gloomy world appeared. Endless stretches of moon-white buildings came into view. The scene was instantly recognizable.

'The Heaven within the Mirror… I can't say I'm surprised.'

But no matter how he tried, he couldn't perform the step of strengthening his own life-mandate. The technique was apparently not applicable to him. Yet as he exited the vision and the world sharpened around him, his heart suddenly pounded.

'What about… that 'Bright Yang' Metallic Essence from Li Qianyuan?'

He, Lu Jiangxian, had his own uniquely advantageous Heaven within the Mirror, where his rank was supreme and could be manipulated at will. He also possessed the 'Wondrous Technique of True Attainment,' the very art he had used to bring forth Li Zhouwei!

His heart racing, he stood up. The vast, sun-like 'Bright Yang' Metallic Essence immediately appeared before him and morphed into a human figure. The magnificent, imperial golden robes from that time reappeared, and spiritual qi and spiritual fire swirled around him like a downpour.

Radiance of the Six Yangs fell like mist, the glorious flames of the Upper Yang billowed, and an infinite majesty radiated outwards. The face of the figure before him shifted constantly, as if possessed by the Bright Yang Imperial Monarch himself, becoming nearly identical to the master of the Metallic Essence—Li Qianyuan.

Lu Jiangxian did not exert any power. He simply watched as the Bright Yang Emperor's face cycled through countless visages, tracing back through time, until it finally settled on Li Qianyuan's profound features.

'Li Qianyuan' closed his eyes, raised a hand, and began to form a gentle hand seal. The technique he was using was none other than the 'Righteous Method of the Spiritual Treasure for Advancing Cultivation'!

This should have been impossible. But the combination of his supreme mastery of divine sense, the Immortal Lord-level Wondrous Technique of True Attainment, and his limitless rank within the Immortal Artifact truly granted him a sliver of an Immortal Lord's mystique.

He was using the Metallic Essence that Li Qianyuan himself had separated to sense the location of Li Qianyuan's own life-mandate!

'Is it in the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment? At Mount Luoxia? Or is it sealed away by several True Monarchs working together?'

In an instant, a thick darkness swept over him, and all scenery faded away. Even though he was safe from detection within the Immortal Mirror, Lu Jiangxian still formed the hand seals of the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core to shield himself from karmic repercussions, a faint tremor running through him.

Before him was only endless darkness.

The darkness stretched on, obscuring his vision. After an unknown amount of time, just as he was about to give up, he faintly perceived four dim stars emerge from the infinite void.

The four stars were golden, hanging in the depths of the darkness, exuding an aura of vast antiquity and ruin. They were hidden within a tyrannical and bottomless darkness, where they had existed for eons.

The Sun-Surging Governing Stars.

'The Sun-Surging Governing Stars? Stars?'

The stars in this realm weren't some celestial bodies in an outer heaven—in essence, they were manifestations of Fruition Attainments. If a grotto-heaven was established upon a Fruition Attainment, it could even be called a world beyond the heavens… But the stars now were in chaos, moving erratically. The Sun-Surging Governing Stars should have been lost in that chaos long ago…

As his perspective pushed forward, the darkness receded. A flash of sunset-red light flickered before his eyes, and Lu Jiangxian finally saw the location of the four stars.

They were beneath a mountain.

As the vision continued to unfold, Lu Jiangxian felt an unprecedented pressure. Cracks began to appear on the face of the manifested Bright Yang Imperial Monarch, but it faithfully continued to transmit everything it saw.

The mountain was like a pillar, smooth and lustrous, its colors distinct. It glowed with layers of rosy Heavenly Glows and soared into the darkness for countless thousands of miles. Beneath it, thousands of Heavenly Glows swirled, forming a world of their own. Twenty-four streams of Heavenly Glow pressed down from below, constantly colliding with the four bright stars.

'The Sun-Surging Governing Stars aren't among the chaotic stars in the sky at all. They were… with some great divine ability… forcibly plucked from the zenith…'

'Not only that, they've been suppressed in the depths of the Nine Nethers.'

A deep chill rose in Lu Jiangxian's heart, but the scenery around him was receding even faster. His vision was approaching the location at an alarming rate, and a dire warning screamed from the depths of his divine sense.

'An Immortal Artifact!'

'Any further and I'll be exposed!'

But in the same instant that the danger flared, he felt a faint sense of familiarity from a distant place. The feeling made his expression change drastically, but he had no time to think. He snapped his eyes open!

Simultaneously, the Bright Yang Imperial Monarch avatar before him exploded!

The cataclysmic light and flames of Bright Yang instantly inundated the entire dimension. His vision was filled with nothing but endless golden light that seemed to want to incinerate all evil. The world shook violently. Lu Jiangxian decisively shot out a hand, and the light of the Supreme Yin bore down, forcibly stabilizing the wisp of Metallic Essence.

Even now, his heart was filled with boundless horror.

Using an Immortal Artifact to suppress the Sun-Surging Governing Stars and the 'Bright Yang' Fruition Attainment!

So this was how Mount Luoxia treated Li Qianyuan!

But what dazed him even more was the trace of familiarity he had sensed in that final moment… it was someone he never would have imagined in a million years.

Li Xizhi.

The turmoil around him subsided. The thread-like wisp of Bright Yang Metallic Essence hovered in his palm, trembling faintly, as if weeping.

Lu Jiangxian was silent.

That sense of familiarity had come from a place far, far above. If he hadn't used the life-mandate's connection to the Immortal Artifact to shield himself as he rapidly withdrew, he would never have noticed it.

'The Sun-Surging Governing Stars are buried in the infinite darkness directly beneath Li Xizhi…'

'Which means… this mountain, this world-shaking Immortal Artifact…'

'Is Mount Duan.'

The chill coiled in his heart, leaving him standing motionless in the illusory world.

'This is why… the Heavenly Glows of the world pause when they pass that place. Why only forty-eight of the seventy-two types of Heavenly Glows stop there. It wasn't due to a lack of divine ability…'

'It's because… the remaining twenty-four are beneath the Immortal Artifact, suppressing the Sun-Surging Governing Stars! This Dao Embryo of the Heavenly Glow path had dedicated a full third of his divine abilities and cultivation base to supervising the suppression beneath the Immortal Artifact!'

"And this wasn't a 'pause' at all. It's an external manifestation of the Fruition Attainment suppressed below… It's even possible that the forty-eight Heavenly Glows roaming the sky are part of a secret formation that spans the entire world, and Mount Duan is one of its crucial nodes!'

Images flashed before his eyes, finally settling on the face of Cen Du from years ago, his voice echoing once more:

'The Heavenly Glows of the world originate from two places: one, Mount Luoxia, and two, Mount Duan. They seem like two separate places, but they are enjoyed by that one person alone…'

Everything finally clicked into place for Lu Jiangxian, but the realization was immediately followed by profound doubt and lingering fear.

'And my divine sense detected no abnormality… Was it because the immortal arts were too profound and had concealed it, or is the true body of Mount Duan not this Immortal Artifact, but merely a stone mountain propped up by the Immortal Artifact amidst the struggle between 'Bright Yang' and 'Heavenly Glow'…'

But he had no time to ponder further. A new, complex thought rose in his mind.

'A Dao Embryo…'

'Behind Mount Luoxia, there is truly a Dao Embryo immortal… I truly am at risk of being exposed before an immortal.'

His expression turned grave, and the entire Immortal Artifact sank into the darkest silence, unmoving for a long time.

'And there's more.'

Though it was just a fleeting glimpse, Lu Jiangxian had clearly seen his opponent's divine abilities and immortal arts. A fundamental difference allowed him to discern one critical fact:

'It's not 'Wu Earth'.'

'Although there was an aura of Earth Virtue, it definitely wasn't Wu Earth. Heavenly Glow is Heavenly Glow. His position is not an Auxiliary Position…'

'The reason I searched every Daoist tradition in the world and couldn't find a path to the Heavenly Glow Purple Mansion Realm, the reason the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition said that older traditions had fewer things related to Heavenly Glow, is because… He is a product of the current era, having created a pure Heavenly Glow position—something unprecedented in antiquity—by borrowing from the Empty Attestation of 'Wu Earth'…'
