# Chapter 706: Yuanxiu's Intent

Li Ximing agreed. Behind him, Ding Weizeng kept his head bowed, not daring to speak. This was a conversation between two Purple Mansion cultivators; every word he overheard was a stroke of fortune. He was inwardly stunned.

'Daoist Master Zhaojing just broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm,' he thought. 'Daoist Master Yuanxiu is a late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, one of the most powerful in all of Jiangnan. Why is he being so polite?'

He knew nothing of the intricacies of the Purple Mansion Realm, nor of divine abilities and lifespans. He only knew it was best not to overthink it. As he relaxed, Si Boxiu glanced at him before continuing to speak to Li Ximing.

"There is a reason for the weakening of the Upper Evil Spirit Storage. It began here in Jiangnan. Years ago, Zipei fell. Kan Xuyu was a grand master of 'Purple Qi.' Zhaojing, do you know the metallic Dao name of Purple Qi?"

"I would be honored to learn of it," Li Ximing said with a smile.

Yuanxiuâ€™s expression turned serious. "Its full name is the 'Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi Immortal Origin Metallic Essence'"

The name alone told Li Ximing a great deal. As he expected, Si Boxiu continued, "The impact of her breakthrough and subsequent death on the spiritual aura of the Upper Evil Spirit Storage was immense. Just look at the word 'Immortal' in her Dao title. And she was a grand master of it. The fact that the Upper Evil Spirit Storage didn't dissipate on the spot can only be attributed to the lingering, overwhelmingly destructive effects of the rain from Chi Wei's downfall!"

The genesis of the Upper Evil Spirit Storage had been the turning point in the Yuan family's decline, when their ancestor Yuan Licheng failed his Purple Mansion breakthrough. His death caused it to rain for days across several prefectures. The Azure Pond Sect had secretly sustained the downpour to disrupt the previous era of Balanced Qi. It was a sordid affair, but Yuanxiu mentioned it with ease, pinning the infamy on Chi Wei and, by extension, the Chi family. Li Ximing immediately played along.

"The weather was erratic back then. The common folk suffered terribly. An aunt from my clan also failed her breakthrough and perished during that rain. She was from the Xiao family, in fact..."

In truth, the Li family had later investigated and found that the rain's effect on mortals was not nearly as great as imagined; it had a larger impact on cultivators, but it was nowhere near "overwhelmingly destructive." The truth, however, mattered little to either of them now.

Yuanxiu smiled. "And now that the old miser is dead, the Wu Kingdom is at peace, and Jiangnan has changed. From the looks of it, we are entering the era of 'Inward Heart Surging Profundity.' It benefits the Ancient Merging and Immortal Daos, closed-door cultivation, and artifact forging. It also suppresses spiritual sense, weakens Earth Virtue, and inhibits demonic arts, while greatly enhancing Fire Virtue powers and clarifying the Twelve Qis."

The Si family's heritage was extraordinary. According to Li Xuanfeng's records, they were descended from the Sima family, a great northern clan. An ordinary person would be lucky to recognize the name of the new spiritual era, and even an immortal sect would likely only know the basics, not such intricate details.

But as Li Ximing heard the description of Inward Heart Surging Profundity, his heart sank.

'Of all things, it had to be Earth Virtue! What terrible luck. The Profound Peak Gate lineage of Changxi's clan is based on Earth Virtue. With this era suppressing it, the already slim chances of those three Foundation Establishment cultivators breaking through have just become even slimmer...'

He wanted to help them, and a new Purple Mansion cultivator for the Profound Peak Gate would have been the best outcome. It seemed heaven itself was working against them.

Li Ximing didn't think this new era was intentionally targeting the Kong family. After all, the spiritual aura had been shifted by the successive deaths of Qingtangyin of Mount Changhuai and Daoist Master Zipei. Changxi's clan was insignificant compared to them, and using one's own death as part of a scheme was unthinkable.

Li Ximing nodded his thanks. Si Boxiu observed him shrewdly. "Years ago, while I was in seclusion, Si Yuanli took care of the sect. I heard that Li Xizhi provided invaluable assistance and deserves much credit. I have not yet had the chance to meet him since I emerged."

"I've also heard that the Yuan family tried to harm him on several occasions. Is this true?"

The question was abrupt. Li Ximing hadn't expected him to sound as if he were planning to settle scores with the Yuan family, especially since Yuan Chengzhao was now a loyal dog of the Si family. He simply smiled. "Not exactly. Those were all Chi Zhiyan's schemes. The Yuan family was an innocent party, and we were on good terms with them in the early years."

Though Li Ximing spent most of his days secluded in cultivation, he had been raised and educated as a potential clan head. He might not be the equal of Xiao Chuting or Si Boxiu yet, but he wouldn't stumble over such a simple political test. The excuse came easily. "Later, some unpleasantness arose from a marriage alliance. The people below love to gossip, and as rumors spread, people add and subtract details to suit their own preferences. It's a common occurrence."

It was a clean deflection. Si Boxiu nodded, appreciating his tact. Having the Yuan and Li families at odds served as a useful buffer for Moongaze Lake. "The Yuan family has an unusual ancestry," he said. "Even I cannot see it clearly. Zhaojing, it would be best not to lower yourself to their level."

Li Ximing couldn't tell if this was a threat or a genuine warning, but it was clear they had a mutual understanding: the Yuan family would remain.

Yuanxiu smiled. "Zhaojing, you hide your talents well. The younger generation is truly formidable."

"Yuanli is in seclusion now and cannot meet you. But the sect's main seat is empty, and that Dantai Jin is an outsider who joined us midway. He cannot command the respect of the masses. When all is said and done, there is only Xizhi."

Yuanxiu smiled faintly. "Why not let Xizhi become the new sect master? It would satisfy everyone and demonstrate our sect's impartiality."

"Absolutely not!"

The last thing Li Ximing wanted was for Li Xizhi to become sect master. Such a position required a corresponding level of backing. It sounded prestigious, but if they were to swallow that bait, the Li family would not only be firmly tied to the Azure Pond Sect's faction but also be forced to clean up the Si family's messes. He would never agree.

"Senior!" he said in a low, firm voice. "My family has never had any designs on power within the Azure Pond Sect! My brother is not suited to be a sect master. It is out of the question!"

"Zhaojing, don't be so quick to refuse," Yuanxiu said calmly. "Putting other benefits aside, the sect master's seat grants access to the Pristine Merging Owl Pool. Within it grows a Moon-Glazing Glass Tree. Consuming its fruit can enlighten one to all Dharmas and greatly increase one's chances of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm."

He stroked his beard. "You know my time is short. While my situation is not as dire as Changxi's, my end draws nearer each day. If Xizhi is willing to take the seat, a share of that spiritual fruit will naturally belong to the Li family."

"As for the Azure Pond Sect's Purple Mansion spiritual items and artifacts... Zhaojing will not be left out. When I pass, they can all be handed over to the Li family."

Yuanxiu's voice was warm. "Your clan is a family of sword immortals. Zhaojing, would you not like to see the spirit sword, 'Great Snow's Severing Edge'? It rests at the bottom of the pool right now!"

"I also know that the White Ye Immortal Sect and the Changxiao Gate have some friction with your clan. If you agree, I will immediately mediate between the three of you. I will ensure everything is arranged to your satisfaction."

'The Moon-Glazing Glass Tree...'

Li Ximing was silent for a breath before bowing. "Senior, you think too highly of us. My family has always been respectful to the main sect; we would never dare to be so audacious. A Purple Mansion breakthrough is a rare opportunity. Please, save such a treasure for Yuanli!"

"Purple Mansion spiritual items are exceedingly rare, and Great Snow's Severing Edge is a spirit sword... The Li family dare not covet them. Besides... with Daoist Master Suiguan overseeing all, everything should be decided by him."

Would Si Boxiu really be so generous? Li Ximing wouldn't believe this old fox if his life depended on it. Not to mention Chi Buzi was still out there, and Suiguan's whereabouts were unknown. Did Si Boxiu truly have the final say in the Azure Pond Sect?

Daoist Master Yuanxiu did not seem angered by the refusal. He casually poured some tea and took a sip. "So be it. Thank you, Zhaojing, for watching over the north for my Azure Pond Sect. If Yehui pushes you too far and you find yourself outmatched, you can always request aid from the sect. My previous offers will still stand. It would only take a single word."

'If I agreed, not only would I have to face Suiguan, I'd probably have to enter the Pristine Speech Heaven. A single word, he says...'

Li Ximing let Si Boxiu's beautiful promises go in one ear and out the other. Seeing that he was unshaken, the old man simply smiled and looked at Ding Weizeng. "And this is...?"

Li Ximing had been waiting for this. He smiled. "This is a newly recruited retainer of my family. Unfortunately, his Qihai was injured by the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion. While my Bright Yang divine ability can foster life, my lineage does not specialize in healing. I thought I would take this opportunity to ask the Daoist Master for his opinion."

Si Boxiu was a great cultivator of Wood Virtue, and a late-stage Purple Mansion one at thatâ€”likely the only one of his kind in the entire Yue State. Li Ximing wasn't one to stand on ceremony. An opportunity not taken was an opportunity wasted. Since he was already here, he might as well ask. It was a small matter, after all.

A damaged Qihai was a death sentence for a clan, but it was nothing to a Purple Mansion cultivator. Si Boxiu heard him out and nodded with a smile. "When it comes to healing, 'Valley Water' is first. Below that come 'Pristine Water' and 'Horn Wood.' However, the Dao I cultivate is a unique branch of Wood Virtue called 'Upright Wood.' It is the union of Jia and Yi wood, hard as stone with properties akin to Metal. It does not foster growth."

Li Ximming nodded slightly. Si Boxiu was saying his 'Upright Wood' was an anomaly among Wood Virtue paths, and his healing abilities were no better than his own. A thought sparked in his mind.

'No wonder Si Yuanli's swordsmanship is so ethereal, with no sense of Wood Virtue. His family's Dao, Upright Wood, is hard as stone and takes on the properties of Metal. A sword is the killing instrument of Metal. It all makes sense...'

As his thoughts churned, Si Boxiu smiled. "If you're interested, you could take a trip to the Eastern Sea. Near the Beihai Sea, there is a Changliu Mountain. The Daoist nun Xiang Chun who resides there cultivates 'Valley Water.' She is a charitable person and might be willing to help."

This wasn't a matter that required him to go out of his way to seek the aid of a Purple Mansion cultivator. Li Ximing frowned slightly. Si Boxiu, reading his expression, chuckled. "Ah, but I forgot the bond between the Xiao and Li. You could also ask Xiao Chuting. He cultivates 'Pit Water' and could give it a try."

Li Ximing's heart eased. After exchanging a few more pleasantries with Si Boxiu, he finally heard the old man speak in a softer tone.

"Zhaojing, since you came to visit me first, I will be clear with you. The Hengzhu Immortal Dao has a feud with the Changxiao Gate, and thus they view you favorably. However, the Golden Feather Sect has its eyes on Hengzhu..."

"I had many disputes with Hengzhu in my youth. Now that I am old, I see things more calmly... but..." Yuanxiu paused, then said casually, "No matter who the Li family allies with, you must not get too close to Hengzhu. It would be dangerous."

It was clear now. The three individuals Li Ximing planned to visit each represented a faction. Purple Mansion cultivators were all shrewd. Having chosen to visit Si Boxiu first, he could not, under any circumstances, go to Hengzhu now. To do so would be to alienate both sides and be left with no allies at all.

'But I had to come to the Azure Pond Sect,' Li Ximing thought with a sense of helplessness. 'Si Boxiu is nearing the end of his life and is naturally sensitive. And with Jiangbei so perilous, I cannot afford to have an unstable rear...'

'Hengzhu is at odds with the Golden Feather Sect and on poor terms with the Azure Pond Sect... who would dare get close? And my Moongaze Lake is situated right between the Golden Feather Sect's poisonous flood dragon and the Azure Pond Sect's sick tiger...'

"This junior understands," Li Ximing said gravely. Only then did he take his leave. Yuanxiu rose to see him out. The moment they left the Pristine Merging Owl Pool, the world felt clear and bright again. They walked out of the Azure Pond Sect, and Li Ximing departed, vanishing into the Great Void.

Yuanxiu watched him go before returning to the mountain. He slowly stroked his beard, musing, "Next is Xiao Chuting. Who knows if that fellow will even see him. Li Ximing speaks well. His fortune is strong, and he is not a fool... just too young."

***

**The Great Void.**

After leaving the Azure Pond Sect, Li Ximing did not immediately head for the Xiao family's grand formation. Instead, he traversed the Great Void, following the flows of spiritual energy until he came to a stop before Mount Xianyou.

A formal visit like this was different from a private one. One could not simply step out of the Great Void into their territory. At the Azure Pond Sect, he had entered through the main gate, a gesture signifying goodwill between the two families. If he had done so for the Azure Pond Sect, it was even more imperative for the Xiao family.

'What kind of figure is Hengzhu, to have reached such a state?' he wondered. 'I haven't heard of him being particularly close to any family, yet he has managed to offend so many.'

This reminded him of something. "When Murong Xia came south all those years ago, he devoured one of Hengzhu's direct descendants. At the time, I just thought the monk was arrogant, but thinking back on it now... perhaps Hengzhu's predicament was already beginning to show then..."

The Three Sects and Seven Gates had always been aloof and remote. Only upon reaching the Purple Mansion Realm did he understand the sheer amount of infighting that occurred within their ranks. As he was lost in thought, a figure approached from the mountain ahead. The man, dressed in a long robe, clasped his fist. "Xiao Ruyu of the Xiao family greets the Daoist Master!"

The middle-aged man had a warm smile and a humble, courteous demeanorâ€”clearly a man of the world. Li Ximing had heard his name before; he had some dealings with his father's generation. He waved his hand. "So it is Market Master Ruyu."

Xiao Ruyu had once been a leading figure in the Xiao family, but it seemed he had made some mistake and was sidelined for decades, tasked only with guarding the market. With no interaction, the relationship with the Li family had cooled.

There was no trace left of the high-spirited youth who had pursued the Golden Tang Gate alongside Li Xuanfeng. All that remained were the deep marks of time's cruel passage. The life of that once-righteous young man had not been smooth either. He had endured different hardships than Li Xuanfeng, and his sharp edges had been worn completely smooth.

He bowed his head respectfully. "My clan uncle, Xiao Yongling, should have been the one to greet you, but he entered seclusion years ago to attempt his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. I can only ask for your forgiveness for having to receive you in his stead."

'Xiao Yongling is attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm...'

Li Ximing was surprised. After a moment of thought, he asked, "If I recall correctly... he cultivates the 'Eastern Feather Mountain' lineage, does he not? Which branch of the Dao is it?"

Coming from anyone else, the question might have seemed like prying into their cultivation secrets. But from a Purple Mansion cultivator, it was a gesture of concern. Xiao Ruyu answered respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, my clan uncle cultivates the 'Capital Guard' lineage from the Ancient Merging Dao. It is a path that has been lost to the Yue State for many years. It was a chance discovery by our own Daoist Master."

It was the first time Li Ximing had heard of this lineage. He committed it to memory but knew it was not the time or place to inquire further. He followed Xiao Ruyu into the mountain. When they arrived before the main peak's formation, Xiao Ruyu finally spoke. "I must ask this Daoist friend to wait outside."

He was, of course, referring to Ding Weizeng. The big man hesitated, looking to Li Ximing. A thought stirred in Li Ximing's mind, and he immediately sensed something was wrong.

'If Xiao Chuting hadn't given a specific order... Xiao Ruyu would never dare to bar my way... What does this mean?'
