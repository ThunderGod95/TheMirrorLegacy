# Chapter 1212: The Talisman of the Luminous Chord

Pingya Island.

Within the palace, a kaleidoscope of colors shimmered. Streams of lucid Mansion Water light reflected upon the grand hall's ceiling like ripples on a pond. A Mystic Pill, seemingly forged from quicksilver, hovered silently above the pool, shimmering with a soft radiance.

The woman’s red lips pursed lightly as she exhaled a breath of turbid air and rose to her feet. After a moment of centering herself, the slight deficit in her divine ability and dharma power swiftly recovered. She lifted her head and looked toward the entrance of the great hall—a youth in a crimson robe with golden eyes already stood there.

"So fast."

A hint of astonishment touched Li Jiangqian's eyes as he spoke.

"Over two hundred days, and with these past few, it has been less than three years."

His golden pupils shifted, landing on the black-robed man in the pool. Li Wushao's face was a touch pale, but his dharma power had gradually stabilized, and he now possessed an aura as light as a cloud.

Li Que'wan, meanwhile, casually formed an incantation seal. Still feeling a little uncertain, she performed a quick calculation to confirm that Li Wushao could now continue his cultivation stably on his own, then replied:

"It was meant to be precise. I've been calculating the exact time with my arts these past days. Barring any unexpected interruptions, the timing wouldn't have been off by a day, not even by a single hour. And yet, for some reason..."

Li Jiangqian, having just emerged from the grotto-heaven, was lost in thought. Seeing that Li Wushao's condition was stable, his mood lifted slightly, and he asked:

"Senior… cultivates the 'Morning Cold Rain'?"

"Indeed."

Li Que'wan gazed at the uneasy surface of the pool and said:

"'Morning Cold Rain' is considered an aberration even among arts of the 'Mansion Water'. According to the joint divinations of my divine ability and shamanic arts, it should ideally be mastered under the open sky. However, that is a matter not easily revealed..."

"And yet, a later calculation showed that its progress in this pool is not slow. Perhaps it is because the 'Neck Feathers' itself originated from the pool in the Wave-Suppressing Mansion."

Her Dao-Profundity was almost entirely focused on the transformations of the material world, and her divine ability and shamanic arts augmented this, leaving her much to consider. Li Jiangqian, pleased with the good news, walked out with her. Seeing her use a divine ability to seal the great hall, he asked:

"With the Mystic Pill left here to refine, how far can you travel?"

Li Que'wan tilted her head up gracefully and answered:

"The shores of the lake are no issue, and brief forays into the great desert are fine as well. But traveling to Jianghuai would be pushing it."

She paused for a moment before adding a reminder:

"In the future, should Senior Wushao succeed, the distance between him and the Spiritual Treasure… I fear he will be unable to leave this perimeter."

Li Jiangqian gave a pensive nod. The two Daoist Masters then stepped into the Great Void, journeying west. In but a moment, they arrived at the great desert and saw streams of light flowing like rain at the base of a mountain, where vast numbers of cultivators moved to and fro.

The great desert was dotted with palaces of all sizes. Some were completed, but most remained unfinished. Seven enormous formation platforms already stood upon the land, each as tall as a small hill. They were as white as jade and covered in shimmering with intimidating, pale golden runes.

These Lesser Yang runes flowed with light, tracing paths down the formation platforms and deep into the desert sands. Occasionally, a fierce gust of wind would sweep the ground clear from beneath the high platforms, revealing more white jade and golden runes below. Clearly, the construction ran far deeper than the platforms alone.

Although the area covered by this great formation was less than a third of the area of Pingya Island, the two were fundamentally different in nature. Pingya Island possessed superior earth and spirit veins, allowing a formation to be established with just a few dozen anchoring seals. But this spiritual formation in the great desert was forged piece by piece from solid jade bricks and inscribed line by line with formation runes!

Even Li Que'wan, with all her experience, was momentarily stunned by the sight before her. She murmured in a daze:

"It's only been a few years!"

Li Jiangqian let out a hearty laugh, though a trace of pained reluctance flickered in his eyes.

"It is indeed astonishing… Not only have we called in favors and poured countless resources into it, but we even had the help of those two younger members of the family."

Li Que'wan's gaze shifted slightly.

"It wasn't just people from our family?"

"Not just."

Li Jiangqian understood her implication and said:

"The spiritual resources consumed are beyond discussion. We borrowed people from Purple Smoke and Xiukui, creating quite the stir…"

He paused, then continued:

"But this is a matter that can't possibly be kept secret. At this point, whether we proceed with great fanfare or with discretion, Western Shu will not let the matter rest. Since the formation's establishment, neither Suining nor Suihuan has crossed the Western Mountains. I, too, have guarded this place day after day."

Li Que'wan said nothing more. With a turn of her hand, she produced three jade tablets. She channeled her divine ability to perform a calculation, flipping them twice. Seeing no cracks upon their surfaces, she nodded in satisfaction.

"The formation's foundation is indeed solid and complete."

Li Jiangqian nodded, his expression turning serious.

"The spiritual resources for the foundation were gathered by Daoist Master Cheng Qian. He is a man of considerable ability, far faster than I had anticipated. Lacking only two components, he sought out Senior Zhong Qian. Now, only about ten percent of the finer details remain, which we can perfect over time. Time is not of the essence for that. The true key is the formation plate."

"Regarding the formation plate, I requested Daoist Master Tinglan to venture out and meet with Daoist Master Yuanbian near Qusi. They are to forge it with the two Daoist Masters of Qusi, but that goal remains a distant prospect..."

Li Que'wan sighed to herself as she listened. The comings and goings of these Daoist Masters sounded simple, yet each trip represented a chain of favors owed. The Li family's influence was currently at its peak, so everyone readily agreed, but these debts would have to be repaid sooner or later.

But as painful as the cost was, the danger from Qing Jifang loomed like a dagger at her back. As long as they could safely navigate that threat, she didn't consider the price too steep. Instead, she offered a reminder:

"Since we have already committed such capital, there is no need to hold back. Daoist Master Ning is also a master of the Dao of formations… She…"

Li Jiangqian shook his head.

"The Dragon-kin are watching. She cannot easily leave Jiangnan…"

Li Que'wan understood immediately. She hesitated before saying:

"If a battle between those of the Purple Mansion Realm were to occur here, the foundation would surely be lost, regardless of who won or lost. It is indispensable. We have done all that can be done; the rest is up to the Mandate of Heaven!"

"Indeed."

Li Jiangqian nodded and smiled.

"However, there is one more matter. I have already calculated the dates and made the arrangements. Since your refinement is so precise, we can proceed with it immediately, within the next two or three months!"

A flicker of confusion crossed Li Que'wan's eyes. She saw that her brother had already produced an urn from his sleeve. It was the size of a human head and covered in a wood-grain pattern. The eyes of the crimson-robed youth shone with intensity.

'Time to receive your talisman!'

…

Phantasmal colors drifted over Gardenia Scenery Mountain. The mystic urn had been placed upon a table of white jade. And though the great lake formation was fully active, only the brother and sister were present on the bright and beautiful mountainside.

It was true that the Li family, barring times of war, held an annual sacrificial rite without fail, with a grander ceremony every three to five years. Some years the affair was large, others small. After so many years of cautious tradition, it was hardly anything out of the ordinary.

But Li Jiangqian was a prudent man, and he had made his own secret calculations.

'A few years ago, when I received my own talisman, it was a grand gathering of the four lineages. That was already an elaborate affair. We are already overwhelmed by the work on the formation; to then stage another elaborate ceremony would surely arouse suspicion.'

For this reason, he had made special preparations. This year happened to be his father, Li Zhouwei's, hundredth birthday—a convenient excuse. More importantly, it was a matter of some consequence to his father's current condition.

"It has not been long since Father was injured; the Supreme Yin pill cannot possibly be refined so quickly. According to outside speculation, King Wei is said to be weakening by the day..."

He blinked and smiled.

"Since the Li clan has been so devoted to sacrificial rites for so many years, and since King Wei carries a royal mandate, it would not be strange for the family, in its desperation, to use his centennial celebration to try and ward off calamity."

Li Que'wan understood. She nodded thoughtfully and said:

"Brother, your considerations are impeccable. But our family has already drained our resources and manpower on the great formation. To hold another grand sacrificial event now… I fear the various factions and subordinates below will surely voice their discontent."

"Discontent? That is better than being slaughtered by Western Shu until the western banks run red with their blood and their lives are forfeit."

Li Jiangqian knew that the ways of the world were often absurd. In terms of sentiment, at least if they were attacked by Western Shu, the common folk would direct their hatred toward Western Shu, rather than resent their lords for the heavy burden. But he cared little for such things. With Li Suihuan there to placate them, he had even fewer concerns. He calculated the time and said with a smile:

"It is time!"

Li Que'wan raised her hand, her expression solemn, and placed it gently upon the Spiritual Treasure.

No matter the demon beast, once subjected to the sacrificial rite, it was annihilated without a sound. This Merciful One, the mystic tiger, possessed immeasurable loyalty, yet at the mere brush of her delicate hand, it perished on the spot, its essence transforming entirely into divine ability and dharma power!

She felt her vision plunge into blackness as a torrent of color flooded her senses. Her world quickly became a vast, empty darkness. Then, streams of pure, clear light poured down. Within her Shengyang Acupoint, the clouds parted to reveal the moon, bathing everything in radiance.

Li Que'wan had already discussed this with Li Jiangqian. Even if she accepted this infusion of divine ability, she could not easily form a second one. Rather than risk exposure, it was better to keep it as a hidden ace. Besides, Li Que'wan was already in seclusion to avoid unwanted attention; how could she render all her efforts moot? She immediately gathered her spiritual sense and sealed away the divine ability.

Her own divine ability resided in the 'Whole Pill' and specialized in transformation. The azure current of power even carried a faint aura of the Shaman-Register Dao. Compared to the slight difficulty Li Jiangqian had faced, Li Que'wan completed the convergence in the space of a single thought, transforming the power into an azure talisman that came to rest within the Shengyang.

In that instant, the darkness before her eyes shattered. It was as if bold, vibrant colors swept in from nowhere, coalescing in her ink-black vision into four great characters:

Luminous Chord of Obscurity!

These four characters seemed forged from lead and quicksilver, yet also like clusters of ink of varying shades splattered against the darkness—some grey, some white, some bright, some dim—possessing an extraordinary mystique.

'Mediate loss and gain, draw from and add to the life-mandate. By the Dao of embracing fullness and guarding emptiness, illuminate the Golden Palace of Purple Cloud. By the method of observing the waning golden throne, silence the Divine Furnace of Bright Fire… With the Luminous and the Obscure both present, so is the Dao achieved…'

This Talisman Qi solidified within her Shengyang Acupoint as if it were a physical thing, lingering for a long time. A divine mystery descended, rendering the yin and yang within her Juque indistinct. Her vision was a field of pure white, and she felt countless thoughts and profundities race through her mind. For a moment, she lost track of her own thoughts, and in that trance, she finally attained enlightenment.

"This is a peculiar talisman of transformation..."

She slowly opened her eyes to meet her brother's expectant gaze, only to find herself so overwhelmed with shock that she did not know how to speak.

Li Jiangqian had been waiting on the mountain for some time. He had been using the Immortal Artifact to keep watch on their surroundings, but he was also burning with curiosity. He could not bear to leave without learning of the mystery. Seeing Li Que'wan's expression, he broke into a wider grin.

"Don't tell me you intend to keep me in suspense as well!"

Li Que'wan could only stare, dumbfounded.

The divine mysteries within were manifold and exceedingly complex. They were not like Li Zhouwei's sheer martial dominance, which broke skill with raw power, nor were they like Li Jiangqian's boundless ambition and limitless future. They were, in fact, fundamentally different from the abilities of all her ancestors.

She pondered it again and again, taking a long while to sort through her thoughts before she finally found the words, murmuring:

"This Talisman Qi manifests within the Talisman Seed of my Juque. It is the [Bright Talisman], capable of this: [Perceive the actions of others, maintain unceasing thought, balance gain and loss, and compartmentalize the spirit]. The first part is easy to grasp. If I am in a battle, so long as my opponent's life-mandate is not concealed, I can almost anticipate their next move. And no matter what transformation I face, the incantations I cast will almost never be interrupted!"

"As for balancing gain and loss and compartmentalizing the spirit, it allows me to fortify one's will, divest oneself of all emotional fluctuations, and make the most rational judgment at all times, without distraction... In truth, this is the very foundation for maintaining unceasing thought."

Li Jiangqian had held certain expectations for the Talisman Qi his sister would receive. He was taken aback and stared in stunned silence.

"The elders once said… that one's Talisman Qi is intimately tied to one's destiny and character… But from what I see, you do not seem the type for battle…"

Li Jiangqian was not wrong. The effect was not a poor one, but if that was all it did, it was merely an enhancement for combat, hardly in line with her Dao of the Whole Pill. But of course, that was not the source of Li Que'wan's shock. She said softly:

"Brother, you have guessed correctly. This talisman possesses the dual aspects of the Luminous and the Obscure. Not only can it reside in my Juque, but if this Talisman Qi manifests in my Shengyang, it will immediately transform into the [Obscure Talisman]!"

"Transformation?"

At these words, Li Jiangqian's expression finally shifted, his face a mask of astonishment.

"It can do that?!"

Li Que'wan's brow furrowed, her expression a mixture of joy and apprehension.

"The [Obscure Talisman] can do this: [Draw from and add to the life-mandate, diminish the forge and douse the furnace, embrace the great throne, and conceal within the profound]. It can elevate my life-mandate and fortune. When the [Obscure Talisman] is active, any factors involving luck or destiny will be greatly amplified in my favor."

"In short, it is somewhat like the Dao of Auspicious Qi."

And the talisman's uses did not end there. The so-called mystery of 'concealing within the profound' would make her movements exceedingly difficult to track. As her divine ability and life-mandate grew stronger, this power of concealment would become even more potent.

"There is one more aspect… one that is exceptionally special… It is to [Embrace the great throne]."

This was related to the shamanic arts. The Shaman-Register Dao placed great importance on one's station. With this talisman's blessing, certain shamanic arts that relied on a higher station for success would become far easier for her to perform—provided, of course, that success was possible to begin with. If she were to stand here and cast an empty curse for Changxiao to die, it would be utterly useless…

Li Que'wan savored the feeling as she explained it in detail. After listening for some time, Li Jiangqian found himself growing eager and excited. He smiled and said:

"This Talisman Qi of yours is just like your divine ability. Hearing about it makes one burn with the desire to see it in action."

But Li Que'wan still had her concerns.

"These two transformations are both incredibly powerful, but they are not without their limits. When the [Bright Talisman] is active, my arts of the Shaman-Register will be greatly suppressed. More importantly, the [Obscure Talisman] must not be perceived by others. The moment I go from being unharmed to being injured, the balance will be broken, and it will revert to the [Bright Talisman]!"

"That in itself is not a great problem; if one is injured, it is time to fight. The trouble comes after the battle ends, when it reverts to the [Obscure Talisman]… At that point, my injuries will not have healed. If another conflict arises, the [Obscure Talisman] will grow indistinct and neither aspect will respond. The [Luminous Chord of Obscurity] will dim, and until my wounds are fully mended, it will be completely useless..."

Li Jiangqian's mind was sharp; he understood the limitation almost instantly. A chill went through Li Que'wan's heart as a dreadful thought occurred to her.

'This means that this talisman requires one to think carefully about the aftermath. It must be concealed and revealed with perfect timing to harness the tides of fate. If I am gravely injured in a fight and then pursued, or if I am forced to act again, it could lead to a long-lasting state where my injuries will not heal and the talisman will not respond…'

Li Jiangqian pondered this for a long time, until the light in the sky began to fade. At last, he met his sister's gaze. Li Que'wan smiled.

"It is already more than good enough."

She was right. Limitations aside, Li Que'wan's Talisman Qi was nearly perfect, in no way inferior to those of her forebears. It had offensive power, it had esoteric methods, it could even manipulate fortune and enhance her station. It was practically all-encompassing…

"Whether it is brother's [Greedy Snare of Profound Li] or Uncle's [Illuminating Sun and Moon], both walk paths of extremes, growing stronger with every battle, more terrifying with continued cultivation. Even our Grand-Uncle's Talisman Qi is defined by its specialized and extreme mastery over fire."

Her eyes shone with a dazzling light.

"It is not a question of which is superior, but simply that the paths are different. The [Luminous Chord of Obscurity] balances yin and yang, drawing transformation from their interplay. While it may not match the others in their specific strengths, in terms of sheer versatility, I fear only our Grand-Uncle overseas, with his [Rainbow Pierce Skyway], could possibly compare!"

Li Jiangqian smiled and picked up where she left off.

"And what's more… in the future, you will have four more 'Whole Pill' divine abilities, also renowned for their versatility and transformations, to complement it!"
