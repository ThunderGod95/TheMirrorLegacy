# Chapter 667: The Nature of Demons (Part 2)

Li Zhouwei remained silent for a long moment, carefully weighing the fox demon's words.

The Demon Cave of Mount Dali had always been on friendly terms with his clan. Favorable rumors, true or not, often circulated, but the bond between Bai Rong and Li Tongya was clearly something Bai Rong held in high regard.

After a moment of hesitation, he spoke. "Thank you for your guidance, Senior. You and my ancestor shared a profound friendship, and we of a later generation naturally treat you with the utmost respect. Since you have spoken, I know you would not wish me harm, and I will follow your advice."

A look of pleasure washed over Bai Rong's face at these words, a hint of nostalgia in his eyes. Li Zhouwei paused, then feigned confusion. "But... while my innate talent may be decent, my clan has fallen into decline. It makes sense for the Dragon Prince Dingjiao to befriend you, Senior, but why would he extend such kindness to me?"

Beneath his robes, Bai Rong's tail gave a slight swish. He tossed a piece of fruit into his mouth and pointed a finger at Li Zhouwei. "You are a White Qilin," he said softly.

Then, he gestured to himself. "I am a white fox."

Seeing Li Zhouwei nod, he stated plainly, "And Dingjiao is a white flood dragon, is he not?"

A thoughtful expression crossed Li Zhouwei's face.

Bai Rong chuckled. "That's just how the dragon lineage is—proud, arrogant, with the hearts of kings. It started a thousand years ago... they began uniting the demon clans, offering generous aid to declining demon races. You must understand, the dragon lineage has always dreamed of becoming true dragons. And what is a true dragon? Their ambition is boundless. They see themselves as demon emperors, and all demons of a single color as their subjects. Having a White Qilin under his banner would naturally be to his advantage."

He paused, a thoughtful look on his face as he murmured, "I seem to recall a Daoist Master mentioning years ago that some fellow named Guo... Shen... something... also received a great deal of help from the dragon lineage."

Li Zhouwei nodded in understanding, though a sliver of doubt remained in his heart. For now, he could only accept the explanation. After a moment of silence, he finally let out a breath and said in a low voice, "But I am human."

Bai Rong snorted, the smile slowly vanishing from his face. His tone grew solemn. "White Qilin," he whispered. "There is no difference."

His voice echoed through the cave. The old ape lifted his head to look at him.

Bai Rong's voice became a little sharper. "You've reached the Purple Mansion Realm. This is merely a physical shell. An ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator can discard their body at will, choosing to be male or female as they please. If you no longer wished to be human, sculpting a body of a bird or a beast would pose no problem. In the Dao of transformation and divine arts, the beast is me, and the man is me. What is the difference?"

He studied the young man before him intently. "And you are even more unusual. You carry the Wei-Li bloodline. To put it bluntly, you are the descendant of a True Monarch. When your cultivation reaches its peak, you *are* the White Qilin. With your innate arts, if you simply will it, you can transform into a true White Qilin in an instant."

"How can a mere human body compare to that of a White Qilin? Back in the day, none of the Wei-Li imperial family thought otherwise. They often walked the world in their demonic forms, only assuming human shape when it was inconvenient, much like any other demon."

His foxy eyes blinked as he took a sip of fruit wine. "The distinction between human and beast was never so great to begin with, especially for a descendant of a Golden Core cultivator. And he was a True Monarch!"

"A True Monarch is a cosmic position, a being that transcends the boundary between human and beast. The moment they achieve that realm, they are no longer human! You carry their blood, so you naturally carry their form!"

The fox demon laughed twice and pointed upward. "Take that True Monarch Lushui, for example. Is he truly just a man? His every thought is the clear green water of the world, a single blink can ripple across every pond from north to south. He is the water, the pond, the spring, the dew... he is even the feathered serpent, the azure flood dragon, the talisman, and the incantation. His few centuries of life as a human are as thin and insignificant as a single drop in that pond."

Li Zhouwei listened in silence.

When he finished, Bai Rong said softly, "Do not dwell on it. In the end, all cultivation comes down to one's nature and one's destiny. If you can one day seek out your Metallic Essence, you will grasp the profundity of this even more deeply."

"I have learned a great deal, Senior."

Li Zhouwei acknowledged the lesson, a contemplative look on his face. Bai Rong nodded, his solemn expression melting away into a grin. "That's what my master always says, anyway," he added with a chuckle. "I just listened carefully and thought I'd share a thing or two with you."

"Then please, thank your master on my behalf..." Li Zhouwei said.

"Well then, let's not delay," Bai Rong said, his smile widening. "We'll go to the Flood Dragon Palace together. The Azurewater Scale-Beasts are incredibly fast; it'll save us the trouble of flying."

"Please wait a moment while I arrange matters at home," Li Zhouwei replied. "I will join you shortly."

But Bai Rong was already brimming with enthusiasm. He sprang to his feet, shaking out his blue-green robes. "No trouble at all! I'll go with you. I can see that old fellow of yours while I'm at it."

The waves of the Eastern Sea crashed endlessly.

Two streaks of light, one silver and one purple, shot across the sky. The silver-robed young man gazed down, seemingly admiring the unique beauty of the Eastern Sea.

"Senior," he said with a smile, "I've heard that there's a Miao family in the Southern Sea whose lightning arts are quite unique. Do you know of them?"

Li Qinghong, who had her own history with the Miao family, replied softly, "I've crossed paths with them twice. They are formidable. I was still inexperienced at the time and suffered a small setback. I might even run into them again in the Grotto-Heaven. They are a peculiar clan, and their cultivation of demonic arts makes them truly one of a kind."

She and Xi Zikang had been flying for over half a year to reach the Eastern Sulphur Islands. The landscape below was a scorched patchwork of red and black. The smoke of war that had choked the skies for so long had finally begun to thin, as most of the islands had already been conquered.

The islands were charred black, with no mortals in sight. The few tattered grand arrays that remained were now controlled by cultivators, and wreckage was strewn everywhere.

The main island of the Eastern Sulphur chain was still holding out. Though it had been under siege for five or six years and its defensive light was incredibly dim, it had not yet collapsed. The ring of cultivators surrounding it seemed to be in no hurry, taking turns to attack, slowly grinding down the array.

The mainland sects, having once been the pillars of the righteous path, would have ended such a conquest quickly. They rarely let a siege drag on for years. But in the Eastern Sea, concepts like reputation and restraint held little sway. Here, profit was the only law, and slowly wearing down an enemy was the most practical approach.

Li Qinghong and Xi Zikang flew to the edge of the main island completely unnoticed. The few Foundation Establishment cultivators standing guard were clearly not of high caliber—lucky survivors pushed forward by elixirs and grueling, life-or-death cultivation. They hadn't cultivated any ocular arts and were completely oblivious to the two figures in the sky.

Xi Zikang observed the scene with her for a moment before smiling. "Senior, do you intend to intervene? My cultivation is respectable enough; I can offer some assistance."

"They're just a group of rogue cultivators... there's no need."

Li Qinghong wasn't worried about them. The cultivators besieging the Han family were clearly a loose alliance of several nearby powers, disunited and weak. Otherwise, the Han family would never have been able to hold out for so long.

She was contemplating the best way to resolve the situation, preferably without a fight. Xi Zikang, however, had already sensed her hesitation.

"This isn't difficult," he said with a smile. "I'll drive them away. You can go and free the people, Senior."
