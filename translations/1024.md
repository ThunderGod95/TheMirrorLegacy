# Chapter 1024: Dongli

The skies over Chongzhou churned with clouds of interwoven color. A mottled stone gate trembled, shedding fine streams of dust.

"Divine ability refined!"

An endless sea of the Great Void emerged in his spiritual sense, and Cui Changfu felt tears welling in his eyes.

'How many years has it been? How many long years! My Cui clan has lived under another's roof... year after year, we've had to tread carefully, catering to the whims of those with divine abilities. We even had to respectfully welcome any Demon beast that happened to pass by...'

'Now, at least within our own prefecture, there's finally a divine ability in charge... No longer will we have to borrow Daoist Master Yangya's prestige day after day, only to be scorned by him!'

The old man closed his eyes. Like every newly ascended cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm, he marveled at the sensation of the Great Void, just as the ancient texts described. Overcome with ecstasy, he took a step forward and entered it.

Cui Changfu's figure materialized from the brilliant Heavenly Light in an instant. He gazed at the radiant phenomena in the sky, a spectacle caused by his own breakthrough, and felt a surge of pride. He stopped before the golden steps of the great hall, only to find the area before the Celestial Hall empty, as if everyone had been dismissed long ago.

"Hm?"

Doubt and unease stirred in his heart. He placed a hand on the hall's door and pushed it gently.

"Creeaak..."

The heavy sound echoed through the great hall. Cui Changfu stepped forward, and the first person he saw was his own clan brother, Cui Changyan.

When Cui Changfu had entered seclusion, he was prepared to die. He had entrusted the clan's affairs to Cui Xianye, with the elderly Cui Changyan to assist. Yet now, this same old man was seated in a subordinate position, while a young man stood respectfully on the other side, a step higher than him.

'That must be the second brother from the Jue generation...'

Cui Changfu remembered Cui Jueyin clearly. Years ago, he had recognized the boy's intelligence and instructed Cui Xianye to nurture his talents. Though decades had passed, he still recognized him at a glance.

And there, at the far end of the bright hall, another young man occupied the master's seat. He appeared relaxed and casual, the gold-embroidered cuffs of his sleeves draping over the armrest, revealing a strong wrist that held a teacup with perfect stability.

His features were imposing, almost fierce, cast in shifting light and shadow by the Heavenly Light filtering in from the side of the hall. A pair of golden eyes stared across the vast space, meeting the gaze of the newly ascended Daoist Master.

Cui Changfu's mind went blank. The man was sitting casually, yet the reflection in his pupils was a dazzling fusion of brilliant Heavenly Light and the potent colors of a divine ability, a swirling expanse of gold and white.

'A Purple Mansion Realm expert!'

'A Purple Mansion Realm expert of the Bright Yang Dao!'

At the side, tears streamed down Cui Changyan's aged face as he watched from across the hall, but he didn't dare speak first. Cui Jueyin stepped down and moved aside, careful not to obstruct the view between the two Daoist Masters.

_Clink..._

A porcelain cup was set gently on the table, the crisp sound echoing in the hall. The young man nodded. "Congratulations, fellow Daoist."

Logically, even if Cui Changfu had only been at the Foundation Establishment Realm a moment before, his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm made him the master of this place. If another Purple Mansion expert came to visit and had taken the host's seat, they should have greeted him with a smile and graciously offered it back. But the young man before him made no move to rise, instead calmly inviting him in—a clear breach of etiquette.

Yet Cui Changfu felt not the slightest displeasure. Instead, he stared at those golden eyes, his heart pounding with fear, his mind illuminated by a single thought: 'The White Qilin has come...'

In every respect, Li Zhouwei had the right to that seat. Cui Changfu showed no sign of being offended. He bowed naturally and said in a weary voice, "Cui Changfu of Chongzhou greets Your Highness!"

He walked forward several paces until he stood before the young man's seat, gathered the hem of his robes, and bowed deeply.

"Forgive me for not welcoming you from afar, Your Highness!"

"Rise."

The golden-eyed young man gestured for him to take a seat to the side, his expression unruffled. He smiled and said, "Years ago, a Daoist Master from my family visited your clan and took a liking to Cui Jueyin. He brought him back for careful training. I never imagined your Daoist Master Yangya would call him back. I had some business out at sea today, so I decided to stop by and see him."

The words struck the old man like a clap of thunder. At his age, how could Cui Changfu fail to understand the implication? His world felt like it was collapsing.

'Cui Yushan! You took our Dao Lineage, demanded our spirit items, and spirited away our talented youth... and even that wasn't enough! Now you want to use my clan as a sacrifice to ensure your own safety! You... you!'

Whether the Cui clan wanted to sever ties or not, how much autonomy could they possibly have under the Dragon-kin? Daoist Master Yangya clearly didn't care if Chongzhou lived or died!

Rage surged through him. He gritted his teeth and spat, "That Yangya... he thinks only of himself, only of his Western Sea Cui clan! He has used every means possible to strip Chongzhou of its resources! I could say nothing about the Dao Lineage, the geniuses, the spirit items... we didn't dare utter a word of complaint. When outsiders asked, I had to smile and claim he was one of our own Daoist Masters... But when others asked him, he acted as if he'd never even heard of Chongzhou... and now he chooses to interfere!"

Cui Changfu lowered his head, his jaw clenched tight. He sighed. "To be perfectly honest, when Your Highness's elder came to the island back then... asking about Bright Yang spirit items, my clan couldn't produce a single one!"

Perhaps it was because their statuses had been so disparate before that Yangya’s actions had seemed acceptable. But now, as a Purple Mansion Realm master in his own right, many of those same actions felt utterly detestable. The fury on Cui Changfu's face was so genuine that Cui Changyan, standing nearby, froze in stunned confusion.

'So this is what my brother has been thinking all along... He was the one enduring the humiliation, bearing the burden. We were the ones who were too shortsighted...'

Cui Changyan then picked up the thread. "Later, when Daoist Master Zhaojing came to Chongzhou and also inquired about spirit items and resources, our clan had nothing to offer... for that very reason!"

"Everything was given to the Dragon King early on. Any scraps that remained were taken by Daoist Master Yangya in the name of 'safekeeping'... There is nothing left on the island!"

Li Zhouwei listened without surprise. He had met Yangya in the Grotto-Heaven and knew what kind of person he was. Instead of responding directly, he changed the subject.

"The matter of the Wei restoration demonstrated your clan's loyalty. But tell me... what is your connection to the Dongli Sect?"

Cui Changfu held his tea and remained silent. Cui Changyan, however, answered without hesitation. "The Dongli Sect was founded by two masters of the Cui clan, from the Dongli and Donghuo branches. The Sect Master's given name is Mu... This master... once cultivated in an Immortal Estate and later became the Grand Tutor in the imperial court. His status was... unparalleled in the dynasty!"

"Hm?"

Li Zhouwei murmured, "Cui Mu?!"

The Li clan was very familiar with that name. The first cultivation manual they ever obtained, the _Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art_, was written by this very cultivator! The work was attributed to the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate... meaning he wrote it before leaving seclusion to serve the court!

And the _Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art_ was a gift from the mirror!

For over a century, this was the first trace they had found of a Bright Yang method bestowed by the mirror! Li Zhouwei's focus sharpened, his guard instantly raised.

He frowned slightly and asked, "But that can't be right. If the Dongli Sect Master was a figure from the Wei era, how could he have survived for so long to become the master of the Dongli Sect? Was he a True Monarch?"

"What was Cui Mu's cultivation level?"

At this, Cui Changyan glanced hesitantly at his clan brother. Cui Changfu spoke up.

"If Your Highness must ask... then before the fall of the dynasty, he held the false rank of a True Monarch. After its fall, he was merely a Daoist Master."

Li Zhouwei's head tilted up slightly, his pupils dilating. He had heard descriptions from the Dragon-kin and understood what the man meant.

"The methods of an Immortal Dynasty... can they sustain a True Monarch?!"

Cui Changfu hesitated for a moment before shaking his head. "The Sect Master was a once-in-a-century genius of our Cui clan. He was selected to cultivate in the estate, and by the time he entered the imperial court, he had already perfected his divine ability."

"The Great Wei Celestial Dynasty, at its peak, had two positions of power. They differed with each emperor... but their functions were similar. During the reign of Emperor Gong of Wei, they were the 'Cardinal Minister of Culture and Order' and the 'Phoenix Marshal of Conquest and Exorcism'. When one of these positions was bestowed, they granted a 'false golden rank'. The Cardinal Minister held this power for domestic governance, while the Phoenix Marshal wielded it for external campaigns. Both possessed the might of a True Monarch..."

Li Zhouwei listened, frowning, as Cui Changfu continued. "The last Cardinal Minister of the Great Wei was the Sect Master. It was because he once possessed the might of a True Monarch that he was granted an extended lifespan, allowing him to move to the Yue State and establish a new sect."

"These two positions were prestigious, but they came with many cumbersome restrictions. Not only did one have to perfect their divine ability before even attempting to ascend to the role, but once the position was accepted, their path of cultivation was severed. There was no longer any chance to truly become a True Monarch. Their very life-mandate was bound to the fate of the nation..."

"When the Great Wei collapsed, the one holding the rank of Phoenix Marshal perished in Mobei. Although the Sect Master survived by relying on the Cui clan's bloodline oaths and his own Dao-Profundity, and was left with some esoteric abilities beyond the peak of the divine ability realm, his vital energy was grievously wounded. His existence became a living death, unable to walk the world freely, and in a fight, he was no match for a peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator."

A bitter look appeared on Cui Changfu's old face. "We only learned of this later... When the Dongli Sect was founded, his divine might seemed boundless. The world believed he had risen from the ashes, stronger than before, and had attained a high position within Bright Yang Dao..."

Li Zhouwei's expression was noncommittal.

'Who knows how much of that was just empty reputation? It might have been a deliberate ploy by the northern powers—letting him rise, only to strike three times and ensnare all those still loyal to the Wei-Li. A convenient way to prepare for their later efforts to 'shepherd' the Bright Yang...'

Cui Changfu continued in a somber tone, "Now, the Dongli Sect has fallen, and all that history has turned to dust. After all, people only pay attention to Grotto-Heavens that have yet to fall, or to lineages that still have value to be exploited..."

Li Zhouwei asked, "How did this master fall?"

Cui Changfu's expression turned grave. "We have no detailed records... but the elders of Chongzhou, by cross-referencing numerous texts from the old Wei, came to a conclusion. This master... likely succumbed to grievous injuries that never healed, eventually passing away in meditation."

He sighed. "The Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven produced many talents, but at the time, its relationship with the various sea-based Daoist traditions was tense, so much so that they were on the verge of attacking our mountain gate. The Sect Master's continued absence only emboldened these overseas traditions... while another Supreme Yang Daoist tradition established itself in Jiangnan, growing its power. We were beset by enemies from within and without."

"It was at this time that the Daoist Master Donghuo, who had been guarding the seas, fell near the Suzhù Reefs. He cultivated the path of Li Fire, and his divine abilities were astounding, having reached the peak of that realm... The celestial phenomenon at the time of his death was world-shaking. The nearby sea boiled, and endless Baleful Fire Qi rained down... To this day, that area is still saturated with potent Li Fire, creating countless salt reefs."

"Once the Daoist Master Donghuo fell, the Dongli Sect's precarious situation became untenable. The cultivators stationed in Chongzhou were all recalled, and the few ancestors my clan had sent over perished one after another. We never heard from them again..."

After listening to the tale, Li Zhouwei remarked with some emotion, "Your clan has guarded the Eastern Sea for many years. It has not been easy!"

Cui Changyan misinterpreted his meaning and hurriedly added, "The Chongzhou branch originally hailed from Zhaoyuan. But when the calamity befell the nation, we lost contact with the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate. Wei Huang Heaven was sealed... even the Wei cultivators on the mainland couldn't be reached, so naturally, our connection was severed..."

"Later... when the Qi... when the Qi rebels founded their dynasty and brought chaos to the north, it wasn't that we couldn't go back... we didn't dare!"

Li Zhouwei took a sip of tea, a hint of doubt in his eyes. "Tell me about the time before and after the Qi dynasty."

Cui Changyan paused, about to speak, but Cui Changfu cleared his throat. "He is only at the Foundation Establishment Realm; it is not his place to speak of ancient history. Allow me to explain it to Your Highness..."

He sighed. "The Qi Emperor, Qiji Tanluo, had the court name Shi Chang. He was born in Mobei and served as a general under the Wei. He was a skilled horseman and archer, fierce and adept in battle. When our clan's ancestor pacified Mobei, Lord Shi's contributions were outstanding, and he was enfeoffed as the General of the Pacified North... for a time, he was stationed to guard Hetao."

"At that time, the Helian family... was just a small Xiongnu tribe. It was because he promoted the Helian ancestor, Helian Bo, while guarding Hetao that the later Tiefu royal clan came to be."

Cui Changfu glanced at Li Zhouwei's expression, hesitating for a long moment before continuing. "Back then... an ancestor of my clan served in the same encampment as him. He appeared exceedingly obedient and humble. Because the commanding general was also named Cui, he deliberately tried to curry favor with my ancestor. Whenever a carriage departed, he would hold the whip and attend to it. Sometimes, when addressing my ancestor... he would even call himself a slave..."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, surprised. "And which ancestor was this?"

Cui Changfu looked slightly embarrassed, but his expression was also one of nostalgic realization at how things change. "He was of no renown... never even broke through to the divine ability realm... The man who once held the whip and called himself a slave became an emperor. It truly shows how unpredictable the world can be!"

Li Zhouwei was silent.

Cui Changfu quickly continued, "Because of this connection, my clan knows a few things... At that time... a young man often visited his tent. His cultivation was not high, merely Foundation Establishment Realm, but he had a refined and elegant bearing. He was known as Daoist Shanqing."

"Later, when the Qi founded their empire, he became the nation's Grand Preceptor. His cultivation reached the very pinnacle of the divine ability realm. He vanished when the Great Qi collapsed and was never seen again..."

"Daoist Shanqing..."

Li Zhouwei mulled this over as Cui Changfu continued, "Indeed... That man's methods were terrifying!"

A look of hatred crossed the old man's face. "The old empire's supervision of its prefectures was extremely strict. Not only were powers divided, but there were also immortal masters from the Immortal Estates assigned to oversee the regions. Although the Bright Yang lost its luster for a day and the officials and armies faltered, the large number of cultivators stationed throughout the land by the Immortal Estates quickly took command. They used their power to suppress the uprisings, and the situation was already beginning to stabilize..."

"But this Daoist Shanqing drove the common people like cattle, breaking through three mountain passes to open up Guanlong. He gathered the people of Wei, only for the Qi Emperor to have them buried alive. After breaching the palace, he rounded up the members of the Li clan and used spell arts to block out the Heavenly Light, allowing the Qi Emperor to humiliate the Bright Yang at his leisure... The imperial descendants died like livestock or were cooked in cauldrons, their tragic cries shaking the heavens."

"Even though he used spell arts to hide it, the Bright Yang is ultimately a Dao that manifests in the world. Whenever a great personage perished, the sky would inevitably brighten for three breaths—brightening and darkening, darkening and brightening, an uncountable number of times..."

Li Zhouwei listened intently, his cup frozen in mid-air. Suddenly, he asked, "What dao did this Grand Preceptor cultivate?"

Cui Changfu whispered, "Dui Metal!"
