# Chapter 690: Proclamation of the Purple Mansion

The moment Li Chenghui descended from Mount Wu, he was met by a cultivator in black armor. The man was thin-cheeked with gray eyes and a sword at his waist. His expression was grim, his jaw tight, his gaze heavy.

“Cousin!” the cultivator called out.

Li Chenghui nodded. “Chen Yang, what’s happened?”

Chen Yang, now in the late stage of the Qi Refining Realm, was shrouded in a swirling gray aura. He cultivated the *Pestle Ice and Sea Expansion Art*, a water-element technique the Li family had acquired years ago. Its grade was unknown, but it was a clear step above the family’s foundational arts.

The black-armored cultivator lowered his voice. “A group of people arrived from the river. They’re from the Floating Cloud Cave, one of the three sects on Mount Xiaoshi. They claim they’re here to offer congratulations.”

“Congratulations?” Li Chenghui scoffed. “The Three Sects of Mount Xiaoshi have been eyeing our shores for years, encroaching on our territory inch by inch, colluding with demonic cultivators on the northern bank… Congratulations? More like a harbinger of ill will.”

Chen Yang’s grim expression confirmed his suspicions. His recent exchange with the envoys had clearly not been pleasant. “My lord, the man leading them is arrogant, yet he’s merely a guest elder in the early Foundation Establishment Realm. They mean to provoke us, to probe our family’s true situation.”

Chen Yang was a shrewd man, not one to be trifled with. He had seen through their ploy instantly. “They refuse to enter the island, instead making a show of force in the air above the lake. The Old Master has already gone to confront them. Please, my lord, hurry.”

Hearing that Li Xuanxuan had been intercepted, Li Chenghui’s expression finally changed. A strange, ancient light flickered in his lacquer-dark eyes, and a purple glow welled within them. “Let’s go!”

A muffled clap of thunder echoed from beneath his feet as his form blurred into a streak of purple light, streaking toward the island’s edge.

From a great distance, he could hear a sharp voice, amplified by spiritual qi. “Old man, still managing the household at your age!”

Li Chenghui’s eyes shot toward the sound. He saw An Siwei standing firm, his long spear already in hand, locked in a tense standoff with a young-looking Daoist. Behind An Siwei stood Li Xuanxuan, his brow furrowed with unease.

Rage flared in Li Chenghui’s heart. He arrived like a bolt of lightning, landing amidst the clamoring cultivators. The six command tokens of his artifact spun into the air, their pressure forcing the onlookers back a step. He slammed the butt of his spear into the ground with a deafening boom.

“You…”

The young man’s face shifted. He waved a hand, dispelling the force of the impact, his displeasure evident. “Oh… so it’s Fellow Daoist Cheng!”

Though the man appeared young and his voice was strong, his aura reeked of decline. Li Chenghui saw at a glance that this was just a facade. In truth, this was some old fossil who had only managed a lucky breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm after a century of cultivation, thanks to the recent surge of spiritual qi in the state of Yue.

“Greetings, Fellow Daoist,” Li Chenghui said coldly.

‘The Floating Cloud Cave is not without powerful cultivators,’ he thought. ‘This man is nothing but a pawn sent to test the waters.’

The Three Sects of Mount Xiaoshi were a relatively new power from across the river. They all hailed from the same mountain and acted as one. With the Golden Tang Gate backing them, they were a force to be reckoned with. They were a typical northern power, unbound by the orthodoxies and immortal laws of the Three Sects and Seven Gates. Their ranks were a chaotic mix of immortal, demonic, and Buddhist cultivators, and they had been a constant source of friction for the Li family over the last decade.

He didn't recognize the man, but the man clearly recognized him. Li Chenghui had stood guard on the northern bank for several years. His lightning arts, combined with the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman, had once routed several demonic cultivators so thoroughly that the Three Sects were shaken and had to send a Buddhist cultivator to deal with him.

“Fellow Daoist Cheng… your cultivation has improved again! I am Zaixingzi. It is a pleasure to meet you!”

Perhaps realizing he was no match for Li Chenghui, and on foreign soil, Zaixingzi adopted a cordial tone, though his smile didn’t reach his eyes. “I was merely asking after the old senior. I meant no harm.”

Li Chenghui was not fooled by the thinly veiled mockery. “State your business,” he said flatly.

Zaixingzi chuckled. “Our sect master saw the rainbow clouds gathering over Moongaze Lake and the sky brightening at midnight. We presumed that Senior Ximing has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, so we came to offer our congratulations! Where might the senior be?”

Li Chenghui stared at him, his voice like ice. “My elder’s affairs are none of your concern. Be on your way.”

Zaixingzi frowned. “Fellow Daoist, you are hardly welcoming. I came to offer congratulations… yet I am not permitted to see him? And I’ve seen no official announcement to the great families…”

He let out a short, muffled laugh, answering his own question. “I believe a failed breakthrough also produces quite the phenomenon… could it be that your esteemed elder…”

The Three Sects and the Li family were enemies. Zaixingzi made no move to enter the island’s grand formation, simply hovering outside it. His voice, amplified by his power, boomed across the lake.

Li Chenghui’s brow slowly furrowed.

Everyone in the clan knew about the phenomenon, and all the major families suspected it was Li Ximing, though they were unsure of the specifics as the clan had remained silent. Now, with Zaixingzi’s public speculation, anyone with a lick of sense would guess the truth. An Siwei and the others stiffened.

Zaixingzi sneered. “To fail after only a decade… your elder was certainly hasty! Fellow Daoist Cheng, you yourself know that breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm is not a matter of a mere dozen years!”

Li Chenghui held his token, his expression unmoving.

With the family in a precarious situation, Zaixingzi’s bold and timely arrival told Li Chenghui everything he needed to know. His face darkened.

‘The Floating Cloud Cave has shallow roots. They couldn’t possibly have understood the celestial phenomenon, let alone been so certain as to come asking questions. They have deep ties to the Golden Tang Gate… this has Situ Mo’s fingerprints all over it.’

Zaixingzi’s words were too pointed, his knowledge too specific for it to have originated from his own sect. It had to be Situ Mo pulling the strings from behind the scenes. Li Chenghui had been a target of that man’s insidious plots before and knew the depths of his cunning. He could only sigh inwardly.

He spoke clearly. “The purple flames on our Mount Wu have yet to subside. Our elder has not yet emerged from seclusion. If Fellow Daoist Zaixingzi continues to cause trouble here, do not blame my lightning for being merciless!”

Li Chenghui cut him off before he could spout any more nonsense, the token in his hand already glowing with purple light. Zaixingzi just chuckled.

‘I already know Li Zhouwei went out to hunt demons!’ he thought. ‘What’s the point in pretending? Where else would he dare go besides the Eastern Sea… and without that White Qilin, does your Li family truly dare to start a fight?’

After a final laugh, Zaixingzi feigned alarm. “Fellow Daoist, please don’t be angry! I was merely concerned. So, your esteemed elder truly has broken through and is now recuperating in seclusion… My sect master had me prepare a gift. You wouldn’t turn me away, would you?”

As he spoke, his gaze swept past Li Chenghui and locked onto Chen Yang behind him. He saw the man’s eyes were incredibly sharp and hostile, like a poisoned blade used for flensing bone.

Zaixingzi was taken aback that a mere Qi Refining cultivator would dare to look at him with such venom. He paused, momentarily forgetting his next move as he took note of the man. ‘Such a venomous gaze. I wonder which Li family junior that is. I’ll have to find a chance to kill him sooner rather than later.’

Li Chenghui heard the blatant sarcasm in Zaixingzi's words, and a chill crept into his heart. ‘It seems the other sects are quite certain that Clan Uncle Ximing has failed… They came prepared. I can fend them off this time… but what about the next?’

In truth, the Li family knew a breakthrough was unlikely given the short time frame. Their hopes were slim, but as long as Li Ximing’s life jade in the ancestral hall remained lit, a sliver of hope endured. Yet more than a decade had passed, and the jade slip had not been nourished by its owner’s spiritual sense in all that time, making its status unreliable.

‘Even with the patriarch’s careful planning, who could have predicted this celestial phenomenon…’

The thought flashed through Li Chenghui’s mind. Zaixingzi had already presented a jade box, holding it out respectfully with both hands while his cold eyes watched Li Chenghui’s reaction.

Every eye was fixed on the box. Li Chenghui swallowed his anger, his expression returning to a calm mask as he prepared to accept it.

‘I have to deal with this for now.’

He had just reached out his hand when another, luminous and fair, shot past him. It deftly plucked the jade box from Zaixingzi’s grasp, turned it over in its palm, and held it up to the light for inspection.

‘Huh?’

Not only Li Chenghui, but Zaixingzi too was stunned into silence. A hush fell over the entire lake as everyone stared, dumbfounded, at the figure in the sky.

A man in a white and gold Daoist robe had appeared between them without warning. His features were not exceptionally handsome, but they were well-formed and proper. His pale golden eyes were fixed on the jade box, and at the center of his brow, a point of celestial light shone with blinding brilliance.

This was Zaixingzi’s first visit to the Li family; he had never seen this person before. The celestial light from the man’s brow was so bright he could barely keep his eyes open. A thought struck him, and he sneered inwardly. ‘Li Zhouwei? So you didn’t leave after all… So what?’

Before he could speak, an excited voice cried out beside him. “Clan Uncle!”

‘Clan Uncle? That’s the wrong generation!’

Zaixingzi was thoroughly confused now. He stared at the man’s face, only to see him look up from the box, his calm, golden eyes meeting his own.

“I have achieved divine power, and this is the gift your sect brings me? A trinket for a Qi Refining cultivator?”

Zaixingzi’s mind went blank. He vaguely heard the old man behind Li Chenghui let out a choked sob that turned into a laugh. He saw the wild joy explode across Li Chenghui’s face.

‘What?’

‘Li… Xi… Ming?! A Daoist Master?!’

Silence reigned over Moongaze Lake, broken only by the old man’s triumphant laughter. Zaixingzi’s mind was a maelstrom of chaos. He saw a blinding celestial light that drilled into his pupils and shot straight into his brain.

The skin on Zaixingzi’s face peeled back as if caught in a gale, revealing the wrinkled, ancient visage beneath. The sheer terror in his eyes vanished as his pupils began to tremble violently. Both eyeballs leaped from their sockets, transforming into two large, brown cicadas that buzzed away into the air.

The sight of the eyeless old man was utterly horrific. His arms shattered like porcelain, exploding into a shower of fragments. The sun in the sky seemed to become a terrifying weapon, causing his entire body to go limp. His flesh, as if boiled to mush, slid from his bones in great sheets. His heart leaped from his chest like an untamed stallion, dragging his scorpion-shaped stomach and a long train of intestines with it.

Then, in an instant, the illusion vanished. Zaixingzi was whole again, restored to his original appearance. His lips trembled twice, and then he exploded into a cloud of flying stones.

Li Ximing turned his face away.

Zaixingzi had cultivated the Earth Virtue, and the stones that rained down from the sky were Radiant Sky Stones, falling like a pure white snow as Li Ximing stood silently in their midst, sending ripples across the lake.

The cultivators who had come with Zaixingzi went weak at the knees. Some fainted from fright, tumbling into the water with a splash. Li family cultivators scrambled to fish them out, jolting them awake with bursts of spiritual qi and forcing their heads up to continue watching the spectacle in the sky.

The purple flames on Mount Wu flared, growing thicker and more intense. A brilliant column of celestial light shot into the heavens, connecting with the rainbow clouds and transforming them into a dazzling, blinding expanse. The whole of Moongaze Lake was saturated with celestial light, its surface a perfect mirror reflecting the sky, until heaven and earth were a single sheet of brilliant white.

Li Ximing did not speak, but a vast, resonant voice emanated from him, spreading through the Great Void and reaching every corner of the state of Yue.

“I, Zhaojing, Li Ximing of the Moongaze Li clan, have this day achieved the Bright Yang divine power! I hereby proclaim my clan an Immortal Clan of the Purple Mansion Realm. In three months, a celebratory rite will be held. All fellow Daoists are welcome to attend!”

The voice was clear and resonant, carried for thousands of miles by his divine power. As Li Ximing hovered over the lake, specks of glittering gold began to emerge from the rainbow clouds.

*Hummm…*

A magnificent, bright white celestial gate, covered in intricate patterns, materialized from the clouds. Majestic dragon banners and phoenix-drawn chariots of every color streamed through it, accompanied by fluttering canopies and streamers. Golden-armored and golden-robed celestial soldiers, each bearing a weapon, filled the sky.

Celestial music and profound hymns swelled in the air as the gate descended from the heavens. Almost every cultivator present lost their ability to fly, dropping to the ground to stare up in awe.

‘The Bright Yang divine power: Audience with the Celestial Gate!’

Only now did Li Ximing understand what an art-based divine power truly was. His own body contained only purple flame and celestial light; his entire power was manifested in the magnificent spectacle of the Audience with the Celestial Gate. The Wei Li clan had been an imperial lineage, and the sheer pomp of this divine power was enough to inspire awe and fear in any who beheld it.

He stood silently amidst the celestial light and music. In the Great Void, figures who had been watching now began to reveal themselves one by one. Li Ximing nodded to them with a smile, listening as their voices rang out.

A celestial mountain wreathed in profound black qi was the first to appear. A powerful voice boomed, “Congratulations, young friend, on your breakthrough! On behalf of the Profound Peak Gate, Changxi wishes you great success with your divine power, and may you forge your Golden Core within a century!”

Li Ximing looked up and saw a middle-aged man with a jade pendant on his chest standing on the mountain. In the blink of an eye, the man’s appearance shifted to that of a white-haired elder, a strange and wondrous sight.

“Senior, you are too kind!”

He returned the greeting, then turned to the south, where a simple cloud had appeared. A stern-faced old man stood within it, his gaze filled with surprise and a complex mix of other emotions. “I am Si Boxiu of the Azure Pond Sect. On behalf of my sect, I congratulate you on reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. As a gift, I offer you the great lake. May you master the five arts and attain Fruition!”
