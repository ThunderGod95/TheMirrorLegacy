# Chapter 896: Settling the Mountain

'Well, what do we have here? A pair of golden hammers!'

Li Ximing waved his sleeve lightly, plucking two golden objects from the pink haze filling the sky. They were the pair of golden hammers from the Buddhist cultivator he had just slain, each one nearly half the size of a man.

Though large, the hammers were of clearly inferior quality, far worse than the monastic robe he had previously confiscated. Li Ximing didn't understand Buddhist arts, but he could still discern quality. With a flip of his hand, he stored them away.

'Agony!'

Pinned by Li Ximing's Audience with the Celestial Gate and scorched by a blast of True Fire, the two Merciful Ones below had no thought to spare for their fellow disciples. They were in dire straits. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual fire, and his 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' was at the perfection stage. They were instantly immobilized.

'They're already suppressed. There's no hurry to kill them. In fact, I mustn't let them become too desperate. If I force them to abandon their dharma bodies and self-destruct to return to the Buddhist Land, that would be a poor outcome.'

Thus, he deliberately varied the pressure, sometimes light, sometimes heavy, feigning that his divine ability was unstable. Although the flames remained fierce, the power of the celestial gate overhead gradually weakened, filling them with wild joy.

After all, the two of them held low status among the Merciful Ones. If they lost their dharma bodies and barely managed to return to the Buddhist Land, no one would help them. They would have to seize the bodies of their own subordinate Master Monks to refine as new vessels—a grievous loss!

Although the Immeasurable Water and Fire was potent, the Supreme Minister's Gourd had already flown into the distant Daoist Master Tinglan's hands after releasing the flames. It wasn't directly upon them, so they still had time to react.

'Self-destruct right now? No, better to stall for time...'

With this thought tempting them, they continued to silently push back against the celestial gate. They knew the man in the sky was likely holding back, but they played along, waiting for some variable to change, for any chance to escape.

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow and scanned the battlefield.

The entire mountain range was enveloped in multicolored light. Daoist Master Kui Qi was leading the charge. A black cord whipped through the air as he held a bronze sword plunged straight through the skull of one golden-bodied cultivator, immobilizing it. His other hand brandished a small, unfamiliar bell that radiated blinding light, hovering phantom-like behind another Merciful One's head.

The strongest of the Merciful Ones, wreathed in Immeasurable Water and Fire, stood upon several golden rings, blocking Kui Qi's path with a grim expression. His once-smooth, translucent golden body was now crawling with dark spots, and several feathers had even sprouted from his armpits.

'I wonder what kind of art he was hit with.'

Tinglan's injuries hadn't fully healed, so she was mainly using the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion for support and suppression. Ning Wan was without her Great Snow's Severing Edge and couldn't quite hold a front by herself. Aside from Kui Qi, the most imposing presence was, naturally, Houfu.

The Daoist's robes billowed as he held his hands high, pressing down on a golden-bodied cultivator. His grey, pouch-like Spiritual Artifact hung high above, its mouth gaping open. It unleashed torrential blasts of Supreme Yang radiance, a brilliant, soul-shaking light that hung between the peaks like an intense waterfall.

Beneath this radiance, two Merciful Ones were thrown into disarray, suppressed by the Supreme Yang brilliance. They could neither summon their flames nor ride the gales. Though not in immediate mortal danger, they clearly had the air of lambs waiting for the slaughter.

Li Ximing had seen this item before, back at the Peacock Sea. It was the very thing that had forced Yu Guang to retreat. His insight, however, was on a completely different level now. As he examined it, he sighed inwardly.

'This bag is undoubtedly a Spiritual Treasure from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. How extravagant. I wonder how many transformations such a powerful external treasure possesses.'

To put it bluntly, with that one Spiritual Treasure deployed, Houfu likely wouldn't even have to lift a finger to give a Purple Mansion Realm demonic cultivator or an Eastern Sea Daoist Master a world of trouble. It was probably no weaker than Tinglan's life-saving Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion. No wonder he dared to preside over an entire region at such a young age.

He watched for a moment more. Suddenly, the Supreme Minister's Gourd vanished from the sky. A ripple stirred the Great Void beside him, and Tinglan, clad in purple, materialized silently beside his celestial gate, smiling faintly at him.

Li Ximing started, his spiritual sense sweeping out.

'Her true body is clearly still on the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion!'

'It's a Traversal Token...'

He understood in an instant. The celestial gate wavered and suddenly lifted, opening a gap. Below, amid flashing light and raging flames, the two golden-bodied cultivators were overjoyed and lunged for the opening.

Tinglan, however, presented the Supreme Minister's Gourd. She tilted its mouth, and a torrent of azure and blue dichromatic flames surged through the gap.

'What a brilliant maneuver!'

'A clone from a Traversal Token naturally has no divine abilities. But its marvel, compared to other clones, is that it's nearly equivalent to the true body. It even has its own sphere of spiritual sense. And though it lacks divine abilities, it *can* activate Spiritual Artifacts!'

Tinglan's cultivation base was profound. Whether by some divine ability, Dharma Art, or artifact technique, she had made this clone completely undetectable. Now, as the raging Immeasurable Water and Fire poured in, the two cultivators inside were momentarily stunned.

Li Ximing finally had his opening. He transformed into a streak of light, shot through the gap, and drew his halberd!

"Boom!"

The Merciful One took the full blast of the Immeasurable Water and Fire to the face, and in the next instant, the light of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd cleaved down. His golden body was mediocre; it could block common divine abilities and Dharma Arts, but already wounded by True Fire and spiritual fire, it stood no chance against this assault.

His entire dharma body shattered, disintegrating from the crown of his skull. It broke apart into a cascade of fragmented, glittering shards, scattering like brilliant, broken glass.

A surge of pink light erupted, but the celestial phenomenon of his fall was blocked by the celestial gate, momentarily preventing it from rising. Li Ximing had already turned, his gaze locked on the other, stupefied Merciful One.

The brilliant radiance of Splitting Light flared, but Tinglan did not press the attack. Instead, her clone dissolved and vanished, already moving to another target.

The reason was simple: this band of Merciful Ones was already a flock of startled birds. If several of them fell in succession, this survivor—who had dodged the Immeasurable Water and Fire but was now trapped—would inevitably self-destruct to escape.

While destroying his dharma body was a significant victory and a huge loss for the Way of Emptiness, if they could kill him outright, wouldn't that eliminate a future threat for good?

The other three cultivators in the sky attacked in perfect concert. Instantly, the heavens filled with overflowing radiance and a storm of pink light.

***

By the time Li Ximing retracted his divine ability and flew up, the True Fire had refined the ground below into a glassy, golden slag. The death phenomena had been suppressed, unable to spread, and were instead condensed by the True Fire, melting into the earth. As the pressure lifted, a final diffusion of pink light scattered.

He rode his bright light forward. The rain of flowers in the sky, now mixed with fine snow, had reached its zenith, falling in a dense flurry.

Snow drifted down. Three massive heads, like low hills, lay quietly in the snow. Their faces were frozen in expressions of shock, fury, and defiance, with ferocious brows and wide, staring eyes.

"Truly a great victory..."

Li Ximing observed, his expression thoughtful.

At least for him, Li Ximing, this was a great victory that perfectly suited the interests of his Moongaze Lake. As for who truly won or lost in the greater conflict between the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and the north, and which side had suffered more... that was a matter of perspective.

Daoist Master Kui Qi strode across the void toward them. His expression was solemn. Despite the celebratory rain of flowers, his mind was clearly heavy, and he showed little joy. He asked softly,

"Tinglan... I see the Primordial Magnetism here has stabilized."

Daoist Master Tinglan, in her purple robes, gazed at Tangdao Mountain, now covered in snow. The slopes were a ruin of shattered walls, littered with toppled, broken statues. She sighed.

"It could not be helped. Now that we have reclaimed this place, it falls to us to defend it."

Li Ximing landed near Ning Wan, overhearing Daoist Master Kui Qi say softly,

"Daoist Friend Hengxing!"

The Great Void fluctuated, and a field of crimson light emerged. A woman in austere robes appeared, cradling an umbrella. Her expression was placid.

"Congratulations, everyone."

'Hengxing...'

'This must be Daoist Master Hengxing, of the Hengzhu Dao!'

The Hengzhu Dao and the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had grown increasingly distant in recent years. Her appearance now made the situation awkward. Li Ximing said nothing, standing silently as if he were invisible.

As soon as Hengxing appeared, the other cultivators tensed with awkwardness, uncertain what to say. Fortunately, the umbrella-holding woman spoke first, her voice soft.

"I was unable to persuade my disciple-brother. He insisted on chasing after the Great Daoist Master and that band of Buddhist cultivators. I never expected to encounter you all. This is truly a great victory."

Her words were laced with detachment. Even so, Daoist Master Kui Qi was extremely polite, even showing a trace of guilt. He said in a heavy tone,

"The Hengzhu Dao considered the greater good and still came to Tangdao Mountain. This Lin, on behalf of the Xiukui Daoist tradition, offers his sincere thanks."

It was rare for a man as proud and stubborn as Kui Qi to speak so amicably. But Hengxing was not appeased. She smiled.

"Naturally. The 'greater good' always comes first, and morality second. Isn't that how things are calculated every year? It's just that my Dao is ignorant. We calculate too little, and we don't get along with Golden Feather, so we rarely come north. Best to avoid causing trouble for you all."

Li Ximing's heart pounded as he listened to the barbed exchange. Beside him, Ning Wan sent a voice transmission:

"I've already ordered the Azure Pond cultivators to move in. You should have your people from the lake and the Capital immortals Dao... come as well to take over Baijiang Creek and Tangdao Mountain. Guarding from here will be far more tenable than from the riverbank."

Li Ximing nodded discreetly and crushed a jade talisman. At that exact moment, the heavy snow across the world suddenly ceased. A Daoist with a gourd at his waist returned, stepping on the clouds and cradling a sword. His clothes were immaculate, his eyes half-closed beneath sharp, prominent brows.

"Greetings, Great Daoist Master!"

Seeing him appear, Kui Qi visibly relaxed, the worry that had clouded his mind finally dissipating. The entire group bowed. Even Daoist Master Hengxing, so cold moments before, showed clear respect for a sword immortal of Lou Xing's caliber, bowing deeply and formally.

The Great Snow's Severing Edge in his arms pulsed with white light, circulating with images of profound harmony. It seemed to be thrumming with excitement; clearly, this outing had allowed the Spiritual Sword to finally display its might, and it was overjoyed.

The sword immortal, however, seemed unconcerned. With a light toss, he sent the Great Snow's Severing Edge flying into Ning Wan's arms.

"I had thought there might be a character on par with Jingzhan or Helian. I didn't expect the north to be filled with such filth."

His aura seemed entirely undepleted. He was, after all, a cultivator of one of the Three Shaman Daos. Li Ximing could see no sign that his lifespan was nearing its end. He looked to be in the vigorous prime of his life.

Ning Wan scrambled to catch the sword. Houfu chuckled.

"Daoist Master, with the Great Snow's Severing Edge in hand, your swordsmanship is unrivaled across four hundred years!"

Lou Xing stepped forward, casually deflecting the praise.

"Ridiculous. Look ahead, and there are True Monarchs. Where do four hundred years come from? I wouldn't even dare claim forty."

It seemed the Great Daoist Master was far more amiable with this junior, Houfu, than with Kui Qi, the nominal leader. While everyone else was reserved and respectful, only Houfu dared to offer such smiling, blatant flattery.

But modest as his words were, the three heads lay on the ground. The power of his sword was plain for all to see. If one discounted Shangyuan, claiming it was unrivaled across four hundred years was no exaggeration.

Lou Xing's return should have been a moment of celebration, but Hengxing simply bowed. "This junior takes her leave," she said quietly.

Lou Xing did not stop her, merely watching as she dissolved into light and departed. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back. Kui Qi looked as if he wanted to speak but held his tongue, his expression frustrated. The sword immortal spoke.

"All of you, return to Tiger's Frontier."

The sword immortal led the group back toward Tiger's Frontier. Li Ximing had his own spirit embryo to refine, and in any case, it would be improper to leave halfway. They soon arrived at the small, snowy courtyard on the mountain at Tiger's Frontier. It was just as he remembered: blanketed in white, bustling with busy cultivators.

They heard the Great Daoist Master at the front click his tongue in annoyance.

"Fwhoosh..."

A grey wind instantly descended, scouring the mountain clean of snow and revealing the grey-brown flagstones beneath. The blast swept all the bustling cultivators clear off the peak, leaving only an empty temple with incense smoke curling into the air.

The sword immortal said,

"Sit."

Everyone took their seats. They watched as Lou Xing straightened his sleeves, retracting the sharp, sword-like aura from his body.

"This incident with the Northern Buddhists is only the beginning, not the end. The reason I went to slay Vija and not Zhelu is precisely this."

"Zhelu is the one presiding over the Way of Emptiness. Whether it's Dharma Master or Wu Light, to make use of him, they need him alive and active. He's not the one to kill. If they were to succeed, it would merely be a repeat of the Way of Great Desire incident. But unlike them, I have no True Monarch at my back."

"Vija, on the other hand, was from the Way of Great Desire, meddling in this affair to get a piece of the pie. He made his wager and lost. Nothing surprising there."

He accepted the cup of tea Kui Qi offered him and continued quietly,

"They wanted to test me. Since I had to reveal myself sooner or later, striking early was a way to cut our losses."

Daoist Master Kui Qi bowed respectfully, listening as the Great Daoist Master spoke again.

"This business with Hengzhu... it was Golden Feather's doing, wasn't it."

"Reporting to Master..."

Here, only Kui Qi dared to take responsibility and speak. He said in a low voice,

"Yes... The... benefits that Azure Pond and Golden Feather agreed upon... it was a matter suspected to involve a True Monarch. We did not dare interfere. Still less could we ruin things for Golden Feather, who is wavering in the middle... The Supreme Yang and Golden Feather Daos have been covertly supporting each other for a very long time."

Hearing Kui Qi's explanation, the sword immortal laughed.

"If Yanque were still alive, both you and Qiushui, every last one of you, would get a vicious tongue-lashing. He would have charged out and forced that Murong Xia to spit up blood."

Kui Qi bowed his head in acknowledgment. He felt guilty, but clearly, he had no regrets.

"Sword Gate adheres to the ancestral laws, and the lessons of the past are fresh. If Azure Pond had never agreed, that would be one thing. But they *did* agree. By the time I came out of seclusion, so many... had already been consumed. If we had driven them off then, Azure Pond would have broken its oath, Golden Feather would have suffered grievous losses, and we would have let the Buddhist cultivators walk away with full pockets. The north would have been overjoyed. Would that not have been even more foolish?"

"Now, we can only hope for an opportunity to sit down and resolve this misunderstanding..."

This made Lou Xing laugh. The sword immortal, who had been famous for his fiery temper in his youth, now seemed perfectly calm. He rose and turned his back to them.

"The Three Profounds, the Four Daos, the Immortal Clan, the Imperial Scions... eventually, they all part ways. The Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition will be no exception. Those whose Daos differ cannot plan together. There is no need to force it. Three hundred years from now, the Great Xiukui Monastery might not even exist."

His voice echoed with perfect clarity in the empty temple.

"I have cultivated to this day, but I have failed to comprehend the Purple Mystery, and my divine abilities are lacking. I no longer have any hope of Fruition Attainment. In the two or three years I have left, I will serve the sword until the end."

"When my time draws near, I will go to Luoxia to see Xueyang. I will walk the final leg of my Way of the Sword and settle that old dispute—the one between the sword technique and the sword of intent. I will go... and see his sword."

The sword immortal spoke with a faint smile.

"Perhaps without the Great Snow's Severing Edge, my own sword light will not match the strike I made today. But this Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... I leave it to you."

Everyone rose from their seats and bowed deeply. They watched as he floated up, transforming into a faint wisp of dark vapor before vanishing completely. The white snow began to fall upon Tiger's Frontier once more, drifting through the empty courtyard.
