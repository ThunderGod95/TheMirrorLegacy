# Chapter 798: The Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda

As Si Xunhui finished speaking, Quan Yuduan immediately stepped forward and lowered his voice.

“Master sent us this time for two reasons. First, a sect mission required me to escort Junior Brother here. Second… I have something extremely important to deliver.”

Li Zhouluo understood at once. With a lift of his chin, Dili Guang led the contingent of guards out, and the hall fell empty in an instant.

Quan Yuduan spoke softly, “Master is guarding the Southern Sea. He has completely overturned the blood-essence resentment system that the Chi and Lingu clans ran for over two hundred years. He simultaneously eradicated the demonic cultivators throughout the entire Shitang Island system under his jurisdiction. With the disciples of the five peaks he leads acting as a barrier, he transformed the islands under his rule into territories filled with smaller sects, minor islands, and lesser factions…

“From then on, they used those islands as their foundation. Several nearby demonic sects, large and small, came to raid. But as soon as they made a move, Master slaughtered virtually all their high-level cultivators… Since then, the entire Shitang Island system has been peaceful. The markets are also a cut above. Southern Sea cultivators are now willing to travel several extra days and nights just to visit the Shitang markets…

“Now, all commerce in the northern Southern Sea flows toward Shitang. This has, consequently, offended Thunder-Hearing Island. Fortunately, Daoist Master Yuanxiu is at the height of his prestige, so Master is naturally fine. He just warned the family to be careful, as he fears someone might retaliate.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded silently, his heart sinking. Li Zhouwei had spoken to him about the Southern Sea. Most of those demonic cultivators were actually fostered by Thunder-Hearing Island. This was probably about far more than just grabbing market profits.

'Daoist Master Yuanxiu likely did this intentionally,' the old man thought. 'Transferring Zhi-er to the chaotic Southern Sea and then ordering him to reorganize the markets. The Si Clan gets all the profit, while Zhi-er is forced to bind himself even tighter to them…'

While his mind was turning, Quan Yuduan retrieved a colorful, glazed pagoda from his sleeve. It was only the size of a finger, small and exquisite. He held the pagoda in his palm and said in a low voice:

“Master specifically had me bring this artifact back. It is called the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda. It was an artifact from an ancient Southern Sea sect that resurfaced a few years ago, and Master spent enormous effort to acquire it.”

Li Wushao took the item and handed it to Li Xuanxuan. Though the object was merely thumb-sized, the old man felt it sink heavily in his hand, almost dropping it. He looked at Quan Yuduan.

“Young Master, this Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda is an extremely special and wondrous artifact that can be used to temper disciples. It has twenty-four levels. Every sixth level has a doorway, which, when opened, unleashes water, fire, wind, and thunder. From bottom to top, they are respectively: Supreme He Fire, Crop-Injuring Wind, Autumn-Perishing Water, and Northern Palace Thunder.”

“As for the remaining twenty levels without doorways, each has a considerable capacity and can be used to store related spiritual items. When locked within, the pagoda can be connected to a spirit vein to preserve the spiritual items. It is extremely useful.”

This looked like an artifact meant to guard a sect gate, the equivalent of a foundational treasure. If it were a Dharma Artifact, it would be something that anchors the sect's destiny, even for major lineages like the Azure Pond Sect or the Golden Feather Sect.

He shook his red robes and explained:

“Master checked carefully. This should be a replica of a pagoda created by an ancient lineage to help disciples avoid the 'Three Disasters and Nine Calamities'. But even if it’s a modern lineage's replica, to us, it still comes from an extremely ancient past…

“Nowadays, there is no longer a need to avoid any 'Three Disasters', so this ancient artifact's effectiveness is greatly reduced, but it remains a rare treasure, integrating punishment and tempering into one.”

His eyes filled with admiration as he praised it endlessly.

“The Supreme He Fire refines True Essence. Within that doorway are three types of potent Merging Fire that have been highly refined and neutralized. The Crop-Injuring Wind expels distracting thoughts; its doorway holds six types of spiritual wind, all possessing clarifying abilities. The Autumn-Perishing Water washes away vanity; its doorway contains twelve types of spiritual waters from the Pristine, Converging, and Pit Water daos…”

It truly was an incredibly wondrous artifact. Li Zhouluo knew immediately it was ancient; only ancient cultivators were this extravagant. The spiritual items sealed within, if dismantled and sold, would likely represent more than half the entire savings of an old Foundation Establishment family.

But Quan Yuduan stopped abruptly at that point. Li Zhouluo couldn't help asking, “But isn't there still the Northern Palace Thunder at the very top?”

Quan Yuduan hesitated for a breath, then nodded.

“The Northern Palace Thunder… erm… it can also kill… in combat. This doorway contains twenty-four types of lightning… Contrary to the previous ones, these twenty-four types are all Profound Thunder, specifically pointing toward the four divine abilities of Profound Thunder…”

“It’s very convenient for killing people. If it strikes the body, it can blast them directly into ash.”

“This…”

Li Zhouluo and Li Xuanxuan exchanged a look. The old man nodded. “So the highest doorway is for defense and killing enemies. Truly profound and wondrous.”

Si Xunhui chuckled. This was his Master's grandfather, after all; he remained very respectful. He cupped his hands.

“My lord, according to the Daoist Master, the creator of this artifact was deeply dissatisfied with the Thunder Palace. The first three doorways, though agonizing, all leave a sliver of life, and one can even receive various benefits. But this top doorway exclusively uses Profound Thunder. Not only is there no benefit whatsoever, but it also refuses to stop until the person is struck dead… The Daoist Master said the specification of twenty-four paths is extremely high… He said that person… must have been struck miserably when they broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm…”

“…Oh… haha…”

Since it was a joke from a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, even if it wasn't particularly funny, the two men in the hall had to laugh. Li Xuanxuan coughed out a few laughs, beautifully admiring the thumb-sized pagoda in his hand.

'This is an excellent artifact to suppress Mount Qingdu,' he thought. 'In the past, when the family punished those cultivators, we just docked some merits or, at worst, sent them to the periphery. Actually killing them was too much… We lacked anything truly intimidating. With this artifact, it is beneficial in many ways.'

The Li family's Milin Mountains already had an ancient artifact suppressing it called Stray Fragrance, an incense burner that could regulate the ley lines and store spiritual energy. For the last ten-odd years, the spiritual energy had been flowing in and out of Milin.

Quan Yuduan smiled. “Old Ancestor, don't be hasty. I have more.”

He took a storage bag from his sleeve and explained, “Inside are four stalks of treasure medicines. They are Azure Reverence Flower, Zi-Wu Vine, Profound-Patterned Yellow Viper Fruit, and Untraceable Grass. There are also three Foundation Establishment spiritual items, and over one hundred and fifty spirit stones, to subsidize the family.”

Li Zhouluo took the heavy storage bag and secured it. Quan Yuduan then retrieved a letter from his sleeve, his expression turning solemn.

“This… Master entrusted this to me, requesting that I personally deliver it to Chenghuai and bring back a reply. I was wondering…”

Li Xuanxuan frowned, hesitating. “Chenghuai is in seclusion. Since it is so important… I will send someone to ask him.”

When Quan Yuduan heard this, he quickly waved his hands and replied, “The matter is important, but it is not urgent. If he is in seclusion, we can certainly wait. I will finish the business I have on hand, and I still have to pass by the lake on the way back. I can see the young master then. It will not be too late.”

“Right now, there is another critical matter. Back when Daoist Master Zhaojing visited Chengyun Gate, it was decided that Moongaze would have a share of the Xiaoshi Mountain Dao Repository. Has your clan's cultivator reached the Foundation Establishment Realm? The time is near. I also came today to escort my junior brother there.”

He nodded slightly and stepped aside. Clearly, the next words were not his to say. Even as the senior disciple of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, he could not speak on behalf of the Si Clan. Si Xunhui stepped forward, cupping his hands.

“Since your clan's cultivator is also going, we ask that you trouble yourself to bring this junior along.”

'The Xiaoshi Mountain Dao Repository?'

Li Zhouluo looked thoughtful and glanced up, but Li Xuanxuan stopped him. Li Zhouluo didn't know the details of these matters, but the old man knew much more. His aged voice sounded:

“There is a Foundation Establishment sword cultivator on the lake. He was raised from obscurity by Daoist Master Zhaojing himself. His Immortal Foundation is the Floating Cloud Body, which is precisely from the Xiaoshi Mountain lineage.”

“He already reached Foundation Establishment!”

Si Xunhui was startled. Neither his Si Clan nor the Li family were Purple Mansion powers who had known about this firsthand; they had joined the endeavor much later. After all, it was hard to find a suitable Embryonic Breathing candidate, and even if they found one, it was difficult to raise their cultivation level in a short time. He mulled this over internally:

'And he's an outsider. That's good. If it were truly a relative of Master, some uncle or elder, it would be extremely awkward when we had to compete for things… An outsider is good. Daoist Master Zhaojing isn't greedy.'

Thus, the Si Clan direct descendant replied, “It is indeed the Floating Cloud Body. With your clan's senior here to watch over things, this junior also feels at ease.”

Li Zhouluo immediately went personally to summon Wang Quwan. Li Xuanxuan, meanwhile, stroked his beard and asked, “I read the clan reports. It said Chengyun Gate captured two cultivators, and an underground palace appeared beneath Chengshui Marsh. Is this true? According to the report, the palace is a ruin of the ancient Wanling Upper Sect…”

Si Xunhui shook his head silently. Quan Yuduan, however, was far more impulsive and direct. He replied:

“Of course that's just what Chengyun Gate spread themselves! It's true they caught cultivators, but they just used them to lure out the Xiaoshi Mountain cultivator, thereby fulfilling the conditions to open the Dao Repository.”

“As for some underground palace, I've never heard of it! What kind of lineage is the Wanling Upper Sect? If they really built an underground palace, anyone entering would just be seeking death. If you ask me… Chengyun Gate built it themselves!”

Si Xunhui's information was clearly more comprehensive. He spoke softly, “It is highly likely Chengyun Gate built it themselves. One reason is to provide a training ground for their own disciples. Second, collecting blood qi everywhere is inconvenient. If they suppress the families under their command for too long, resentment inevitably builds. This palace is much more useful.”

“And they can sell talismans and pills on the side, making their sect's legitimate business easier… After all, their items are crude and simply cannot compete with Jiangnan. Using this method, they can continuously and reliably profit from the local area.”

Li Xuanxuan understood and nodded. Li Zhouluo had already returned, bringing Wang Quwan up from outside the hall. The middle-aged man still wore his sword, his expression grave. Li Zhouluo smiled.

“Protector Wang, this is the First Disciple of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, Quan Yuduan… And this… is Young Master Si Xunhui of the Azure Pond Si Clan.”

These two names might not sound too terrifying to the current Li family, but in Wang Quwan's eyes, they were absolute top-tier young masters. The Si Clan now ruled the Azure Pond Sect. He quickly moved to bow, but he heard Si Xunhui call out:

“Greetings, Senior. We… will be troubling you this time.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded lightly and spoke. “These two disciples from the immortal sects are heading to that underground palace and were passing through. Since you also received the opportunity, you will go together.”

“How can this be permissible?... Such an opportunity should go to the direct line of Moongaze…”

Wang Quwan's first reaction was panic. He tried to bow lower, but Quan Yuduan understood the situation. He gave a meaningful look and smilingly interrupted:

“The scenery of Moongaze Lake is beautiful. We brothers will take a stroll on the lake and return later.”

He pulled Si Xunhui away. Li Xuanxuan waved his hand, and Li Zhouluo also retreated, leaving only the two of them in the hall. Wang Quwan knelt firmly. Li Xuanxuan helped him up, speaking softly:

“Quwan, rest assured. You are not being sent as a pawn. Although Si Xunhui is a young master of the Azure Pond Sect, this time you are not meant to protect him… If they really needed protection, why wouldn't Azure Pond just send two Peak Lords?”

This sentence startled Wang Quwan. He quickly raised his eyebrows. The old man before him was smiling and nodding.

“This time, you are representing the Moongaze Li Clan. Although I do not know the situation in the underground palace, few families should trouble you right now. Foundation Establishment cultivators have their own opponents. Protect yourself, and see what opportunities you can fight for.”

“As for Si Xunhui, do not fear him too much. Whatever should be shared, you take your rightful share. Unless it is a spiritual item of the Purple Mansion level—in that case, you must let him take it, so that you can stay alive…”

Wang Quwan finally nodded, his voice respectful. “This subordinate will remember the Old Master's instructions and will do my absolute best…”

Li Xuanxuan continued, “As you head out, go find Zhouluo. Get the Hundred-Stone Spirit Shield and the Crimson Orb Jade of the Profound Peak Gate from him. After all, the palace is filled with the direct descendants of Purple Mansion lineages. We are not asking you to gain great prestige, but with these two items for protection, at least you will not be completely suppressed by a single artifact.”

These were two complete Foundation Establishment artifacts. The Hundred-Stone Spirit Shield was of ordinary quality, but the Crimson Orb Jade was an exceptionally rare treasure. Wang Quwan nodded heavily, finally saying:

“Quwan will remember the main family's grace. I will certainly bring both of these artifacts back fully intact from this trip north.”

Only then did Li Xuanxuan see him out, instructing Li Zhouluo to equip him with the artifacts. Wang Quwan, however, set the items down, stating solemnly:

“This matter is significant. Please allow this subordinate to return home first and instruct my descendants. I will then return to retrieve the two artifacts.”

He rode the wind toward Jiangbei. Si Xunhui and Quan Yuduan, who said they were going to tour the lake, flew a circle. Li Wushao returned early.

The old demon still wore his middle-aged appearance, wearing a sword at his waist. Upon seeing Li Xuanxuan, he bowed, his voice low and hoarse:

“Wushao greets the Old Master!”

Li Wushao's appearance greatly resembled Li Yuanjiao. Li Xuanxuan stared, dazzled, and quickly helped him up, tears welling in the corners of his eyes.

“It has been many days…”

Li Wushao saw this and cupped his hands. “Old Master! I’m having a great time at Azure Pond! In that damn place, everyone calls me Lord Li. But if I take a trip to the Eastern Sea, and they don't recognize me, shit, they might even try to capture me for alchemy… Haha…”

The old man couldn't help but laugh, shaking his head. “You still speak so crudely, even after entering an immortal sect… You can't shake those Eastern Sea habits. People will talk about you…”

“Can't learn! Won't learn!”

Li Wushao said, “They have to say I'm 'frank and passionate,' 'unrestrained and free.' I say it's all bullshit… Anyway, I've returned and taken a look around, so I have something to report back to the Pavilion Master. The young master isn't married yet, is he?”
