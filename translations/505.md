# Chapter 759: Reforging Dharma Artifacts

Li Xuanfeng landed on the peak and saw everyone looking up at him. He noticed many unfamiliar faces among them. Ning Heyuan stood at the front, hands clasped behind his back, his expression relaxed and eyebrows slightly lifted, concealing a trace of pride.

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly, and Ning Heyuan immediately stepped forward and said softly, "Congratulations, Brother-in-law..."

He stepped aside, revealing the man behind him. It was Chi Zhiyan, younger brother of Sect Master Chi Zhiyun. The man had a somewhat sinister appearance and narrow eyes, which he opened bigger only upon seeing Li Xuanfeng.

He smiled and said, "Daoist, your archery is truly formidable! To kill Murong Wu in just a quarter of an hour, our eyes have been thoroughly opened!"

Chi Zhiyan, nearly the highest-ranking person present, gestured for him to enter for a more private discussion. His tone remained courteous as he asked, "Which Daoist Masters did you meet?"

"Daoist Masters Qiushui and Yuan Xiu..." Li Xuanfeng answered as he stepped forward. He stood a head taller than Chi Zhiyan, who looked up and met his eyes. Li Xuanfeng continued in a deep voice, "The Daoist Masters gifted me a pill, offered much encouragement, and said little else."

Chi Zhiyan seemed to be thinking deeply. He lowered his head and, after a moment, asked, "And what sort of immortal pill was it?"

"A Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill..." Li Xuanfeng spoke the name as he searched Chi Zhiyan’s face. The man’s eyes were blank, and he seemed to ponder it repeatedly, as though he had never heard the name before.

"Which Daoist Master gave it to you?" asked Chi Zhiyan.

"Daoist Master Yuan Xiu." Li Xuanfeng replied and, seeing that Chi Zhiyan still looked utterly puzzled, thought to himself, Chi Zhiyan probably has no idea what it is...

He answered a few more of Chi Zhiyan’s questions perfunctorily. Once enough courtesy had been shown, he finally said, "I’ve just come from a fierce battle and am wounded... Forgive me for not staying longer. Once I finish healing and stabilize my qi, I’ll take the pill."

Chi Zhiyan could only nod and retreat. Ning Heyuan bustled in shortly after. Li Xuanfeng had only managed to suppress his injuries after half an hour of treatment, but the exertions along the way had caused his organs to ache again, and his face was slightly pale.

He simply took out Murong Wu’s helmet and armor and tossed them to the ground. Instantly, dharma light shimmered across the jade tiles. He said softly, "Have this armor reforged. Find a few artifact smiths to present a couple of designs for re-casting. I'll choose one or two."

Ning Heyuan nodded lightly. Li Xuanfeng quickly made his way down and saw Li Qinghong waiting in the hall.

When she saw him approach, she looked at him with concern. "Second uncle, how are your injuries?"

Li Xuanfeng merely exhaled and waved it off. Seeing his expression, Li Qinghong quickly explained how she had injured Helian Changguang and took two items out from her storage pouch.

One was a dark green fan with intricate patterns and densely inscribed spells, arranged in five distinct totem-like motifs. Its style was refined, but carried a hint of opulence.

The other item was a white brocade robe with long turquoise feathers at the shoulders. It had previously been worn by a devil cultivator and was shrouded in demonic energy, concealing its features. Now that it was revealed, it looked ethereal. However, it was slightly faded, since it had been scorched by lightning.

Li Xuanfeng listened carefully, then activated the array in the hall and said, "Qinghong, the Helian Family is of royal blood in the Tiefo State, north of Zhao. From your description, Helian Changguang holds some status. To fight two and kill one on your own is not an easy feat."

His old eyes beneath his brows were still sharp. He stood with arms crossed; even in his injured state, his voice was crisp and firm, "But offending that man isn’t a good thing. I’ll make a note of it. Stay within the pass for now and cultivate. When I make a circuit eastward, I’ll find him and shoot him before he has time to hold a grudge."

Li Qinghong was taken aback. Though she wasn’t afraid of the man, she had family in the pass and couldn’t remain constantly on guard. There was some risk.

Still, unwilling to trouble Li Xuanfeng too much, she replied, "Thank you, second uncle... but your own matters are more important."

Li Xuanfeng only shook his head and said with a slightly hoarse voice, "Even if you weren’t the strongest in the family, you would be going regardless. Killing a single devil cultivator isn’t an issue."

He didn’t say more. After a closer look, he pointed at the two dharma artifacts and said, "The Helian Family has deep foundations; these two dharma artifacts are of decent quality. I know you’re uneasy wielding them. Go find Ning Heyuan and have him assign someone to escort you to the central region to have them reforged."

Li Xuanfeng paused, then gave special instructions, "Don’t reforge them on Mount Bianyan. There are too many eyes and too many complications. I’ll have Murong Wu’s armor remade and delivered home to the younger generation."

Li Qinghong understood that by ‘younger generation,’ he meant Li Zhouwei. She nodded and kept it in mind. Li Xuanfeng already looked tired as he waved his hand and started to make his way out. Li Qinghong accompanied him out of the hall, thinking to herself, Second uncle’s authority grows heavier by the day.

She went to find Ning Heyuan, who was now quite enthusiastic. He brought several artifact smiths under his command and specifically introduced one, a burly old man in red robes.

Ning Heyuan said with a smile, "This is Daoist Chu, he once practiced at the Moongaze Lake Market. He’s an old acquaintance of my brother-in-law!"

Li Qinghong nodded. She understood what Li Xuanfeng meant about the mountain being crowded with watching eyes. She had already grown restless, so she didn’t exchange many words with Daoist Chu before hurriedly taking her leave with him.

She brought along Fei Tongyu, who still looked weary and dispirited. The three of them flew off together.

As they flew, Li Qinghong quickly offered an apology and asked, "The matter is urgent, so I dared not linger. May I ask for your name, fellow Daoist?"

"Chu Minglian." The old man laughed heartily, clasped his hands behind his back, puffed out his chest, and replied with great gravitas, "Back in my youth, I refined artifacts at the Moongaze Lake Market. The Golden Age Longbow that Xuanfeng wields was crafted by none other than myself!

"Even sword immortals came to my shop to stock up before heading home!"

This was clearly Chu Minglian’s favorite boast, one he shared with everyone he met. After a round of hearty laughter, Li Qinghong’s eyes suddenly lit up with anticipation as she asked, "Then, senior, have you ever seen my father, Li Xuanling?"

"Li Xuanling...? I've heard of Li Xuanxuan... but never Li Xuanling," he replied.

Chu Minglian looked slightly embarrassed. Li Qinghong quickly added, "He is the son of the Celestial Moon Sword."

"Oh!" Chu Minglian’s demeanor instantly turned solemn, and he nodded, "So you are the granddaughter of Li Tongya..."

He recalled fondly, "Of the three who came back then, he alone looked like a mere escort. I vaguely remember his broad shoulders. Who would've thought he was such a remarkable figure?"

The two continued smiling as they chatted, and soon returned to the inner pass. They saw Kongheng pacing around from a distance, scanning the area, but there was no sign of Li Wushao.

Li Qinghong casually asked and learned that there was a Foundation Establishment Realm female cultivator within the central valley whose mount was a white Hooked Serpent. Li Wushao hadn’t seen another of its kind in decades and couldn’t restrain his excitement, so he went to pay a visit.

The news surprised Li Qinghong a little. She chuckled softly, then led Chu Minglian and Kongheng forward before bringing out the two dharma artifacts.

Chu Minglian examined them carefully, but Kongheng was the first to speak, his voice thoughtful, "This fan looks like something from the Helian Family. As for the robe... hard to say, but it carries an ancient aura."

Chu Minglian paused, slightly surprised by the monk’s sharp insight. He then showed his own depth of knowledge and said softly, "I've never been to the north, so I can’t speak much on the fan. But the robe, there’s definitely something to it."

He lifted the snowy-white robe, examined the turquoise feathers on its shoulders, and carefully studied the patterns embroidered on it before speaking in a low voice, "There is a ninety percent chance this is from the Wanglin Sect of Ning State."

Wanglin Sect...

Li Qinghong had heard of that immortal sect before; her family’s Wanglin Blossom technique also originated from them. But a sudden doubt rose in her heart, He claims to be a rogue cultivator... yet his knowledge is so precise. It seems his inheritance must be a long-standing one...

Chu Minglian examined the robe carefully, clicking his tongue in admiration before continuing, "The Wanglin Sect is composed mostly of women. This dharma robe reflects that delicate feminine touch. They’ve long followed the ancient system of separating sect halls by region. The thirty-six feather patches arranged in two rings likely represent the various sub-temples under their governance."

Li Qinghong listened intently and nodded, "Senior, your insight is impressive... May I ask, what is the strength of this sect?"

"They call themselves an upper sect, so of course they have Golden Core Realm cultivators." Chu Minglian sighed, as though suddenly remembering something, and added, "My Chu family originally came from Jiangbei, so naturally, I know of them..."

"Chu... the Chu family from which prefecture?"

Only now did Li Qinghong realize that Chu Minglian had a family background too. She had thought him to be from a minor lineage, which would have explained his lack of reputation. But since he had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, he ought to have belonged to a proper cultivation family.

Chu Minglian’s aged eyes narrowed slightly as he adjusted his red robes. A hint of melancholy touched his voice as he answered, "It was once a small family... but now there’s no Chu Family left to speak of."

His expression dimmed further as he added, "My grandnephew... his name was Chu Yi, the Li Fire Spear."

Chu Yi!

The name had faded into history for decades, yet it was still whispered among cultivators. Those who had lived through it remembered with unease. He was a rogue cultivator who caused chaos, forced open the long-sealed Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven of the Dongli Sect, and singlehandedly stirred a storm that shook the entire Yue State.

The Li Family had benefited greatly from that event. The jade vial on Li Qinghong’s waist was most likely an item from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven and of ancient provenance.

"He had posed as a rogue cultivator back then, but offended the Han Family, who uncovered the truth in secret. He was still in seclusion when calamity struck our home."

Chu Minglian seemed unwilling to dwell further on it. But clarity dawned in Li Qinghong’s heart, So it was this Chu! The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven incident stirred such chaos... Most likely, he recovered his memories and went to Mount Luoxia, never to return... No wonder Chu Minglian feels so disheartened.

Though she understood, Li Qinghong didn’t wish to press further. She sighed and remained silent.

Chu Minglian quickly regained his cheer and said, "This brocade fan isn’t much. One glance is enough to reveal that it’s a crude collaboration between a northern buddhist cultivator and a devil cultivator. I can reforge it with a few materials. Give me a few months and it’ll be usable.

"As for this robe..."

Chu Minglian examined it again with great care, then spoke seriously, "I see many poorly crafted additions. This robe was likely lost from an immortal sect, then passed through the hands of several devil cultivators who added and patched it over time, either due to damage or blind tampering, until it is what it is now.

"I’ll just remove those faulty patches and repair it according to the original markings. It’ll take half a year or so, and once done, it’ll be much better than its current state. I’ll need some Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items though, depending on what can be gathered."

Chu Minglian accepted the task with great confidence. Li Qinghong recalled the many spirit items Li Xijun had given her and laid them out one by one on the table.

Chu Minglian examined the spirit items thoroughly and confidently said, "If you trust me, leave it to me. I’ll trade some of these, get more materials from the mountains, and if it’s still not enough, I’ll ask you for more later."

Li Qinghong nodded readily and politely saw him off. Kongheng followed beside her, a hint of worry in his expression as he quietly asked, "Daoist Qinghong... did you kill someone from the Helian Family?"

"I didn’t quite kill him... but it was close. We met on the battlefield and there was no way out." Li Qinghong answered casually.

Kongheng followed behind, feeling a quiet unease as he thought to himself, Could fate have intertwined their paths? The Helian Family’s ancestors were once a border tribe of Wei State... and received favors long ago...

As the thought lingered, he chuckled inwardly, It’s been so many years... I’m overthinking it. Always reading too deeply into fate and karma. Now I’ve gone and entangled myself in it too.

————

Mount Qingdu.

Li Xijun received the remains of those who had returned from the north. He collected the bones of Li Chengchu, then examined the other corpses one by one. Two were from lesser branches, one from the Chen Family, two from the Xu Family, and one from the Dou Family.

Li Xijun had watched Li Chengchu grow up. He was quiet, reserved, and a fast cultivator. Now, as he looked at his cold remains, all Li Xijun could do was sigh.

The Ning Family had offered some compensation. Li Xijun, on behalf of the family, also provided a stipend and arranged for the remains to be returned to their respective families. Under the clear moonlight, he silently reflected, This is only the beginning.

He had received word from Li Qinghong. She and Li Xuanfeng were only lightly wounded. Li Xizhi’s Baixiang Valley had also been among the few places untouched by conflict, which gave Li Xijun a measure of relief.

But it’s still Brother Xizhi’s side that worries me more... They haven’t been attacked yet, but they’re facing the Tuoba Family. If anyone comes for them, it won’t be a simple matter.

As he mulled, Chen Donghe came rushing up, gave a quick bow, and said gravely, "A monk has appeared in Lijing Town!"

Li Xijun’s heart skipped a beat. He quickly rose from the main seat. Though he had long been prepared for this, tension still surged through him.

He strode out of the hall and asked, "What’s the situation? Can you tell who he is?"

The Li Family’s great formation only protected a few immortal peaks. It was pure fantasy to think it could cover the dozens of towns around Moongaze Lake. Those outlying areas had only basic warding arrays and cultivators rotating day and night patrols.

These measures could detect low-level devil cultivators, but if a Foundation Establishment Realm buddhist or devil cultivator slipped into town, they would almost certainly go undetected. Only strange movements might trigger a response.

Li Xijun had long suspected that some Master Monk would eventually infiltrate a town to gather information. He had placed guards everywhere, so that any disturbance would be noticed.

So he asked two quick questions, "Did he kill anyone? Or confuse minds?"

Chen Donghe shook his head and replied solemnly, "The monk is just sitting in the restaurant in town. He asked someone to send word that he wishes to see the Li Family’s steward.

"The townsfolk, startled by his sudden appearance in monk’s robes, were both frightened and uneasy. They sent someone to inform the mountain immediately. I happened to be patrolling nearby and rushed here with the news."
