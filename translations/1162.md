# Chapter 1162: To Remain Whole

The sky churned with roiling energy, scattering clouds and vapor until the brilliant light dimmed to nothing. It merged with the shadows of the Exiled Qi, precipitating into a heavy, oppressive gloom.

The palm, blasted apart by the Jade True light, was filled with shattered jade. Amidst the fragments, the Chu State military tally still pulsed with a faint, crimson glow.

Yang Ruiyi’s black robes whipped about in the fierce wind, the sword at his waist a deep, somber shade. He parted his lips and spoke a single, cold name,

“Tian Langzhi…”

The eight-life Maha lowered his gaze to the shards of jade in his hand. A fury began to brew in his eyes—not the wild anger of frustration or the bitterness of regret, but an indignation steeped in shock and sudden, jarring comprehension.

Only when Yang Ruiyi’s voice echoed through the air did the Maha look up from his stupor. An irrepressible laugh burst from him as he said coldly,

“Grand General Yang, why the pretense? You raced a thousand li to shroud this place in Exiled Qi… for which sword? Do you think I don’t know?”

The words struck Yang Ruiyi like a physical blow, and the last shred of hesitation in his eyes gave way to resignation. He took a step forward, drew his sword, and commanded,

“Get out of Jianghuai.”

Tian Langzhi’s gaze was venomously cold. He raised an eyebrow and sneered,

“And if I refuse? What will you do? I’ll wait right here for Cheng Xunzhi. Does your Song Court dare to fight?”

Yang Ruiyi, already in a foul mood, actually laughed at the threat.

“You are welcome to take that gamble,” he said, his voice tight with fury. “If a war breaks out here and now, do you think my Yang clan won’t do everything to protect Cheng Xunzhi? Will you, an eight-life Maha, be able to preserve your own life? And can that master of yours bear the full wrath of the Underworld!”

Tian Langzhi’s lips trembled, his eyes flickering with uncertainty as if trying to gauge Yang Ruiyi’s resolve. The black-robed man’s expression grew increasingly grim, his eyes locked on Tian Langzhi.

“Why do you think the Golden Feather Sect is stationed at the White River right now?” he said in a low voice. “Tangdao Mountain is just over the ridge from there. Don’t be a fool.”

The statement landed like a thunderclap under the dark clouds, and a look of horror crossed Tian Langzhi’s face. He stumbled back a step, but before he could speak, a faint yet distinct cracking sound echoed from the heavens.

“Crack.”

Everyone’s expression changed in an instant as their gazes shot toward a single point.

A corner of the thick, ink-black Exiled Qi blanketing the sky had shattered. Like a ray of light piercing a sealed, dark room, a point of bright Dui Metal Sword Intent appeared in the fissure.

The edge of a sword, etched with a pattern of golden pear blossoms, thrust into view!

‘So fast!’

The world seemed to shake. Yang Ruiyi’s eyes flared with a mixture of shock and rage as roiling black qi began to flow into his hands. In the Great Void, the watching Daoist grew tense, his form suddenly materializing. He raised his hand, forming a seal with two fingers before his lips.

The moment he saw that figure, Tian Langzhi knew the situation had escalated. The hatred in his eyes vanished, replaced by urgency. He sprang into the air, gathered his two Dharma Protectors, and transformed into a streak of brilliant white Buddhist light, hastily descending into the Buddhist Land below.

A pair of sword-like pupils lit up in the oppressive darkness.

‘Damn that Tian Langzhi!’

Seeing the figure of the Dui Metal sword immortal emerge, Yang Ruiyi’s heart plunged into an icy abyss. Fortunately, the Buddhist light had already fled, disappearing over the horizon. The Great Daoist Master of the Sword Gate could only stand silently in the raging wind, his aura as cold as ice.

The iridescent light of Jade True descended from the heavens, bit by bit. Yang Ruiyi suppressed the chill in his heart and lowered his head.

“Senior Cheng…”

Cheng Xunzhi was silent. After a long moment, his voice, raspy and strained, finally came.

“Liu Bai has fallen.”

Yang Ruiyi’s voice was bleak.

“Tian Langzhi borrowed the Purple-Gold Scenery Ingot-Flint… even this grand formation couldn’t stop him…”

The sword immortal turned his head, his gaze lingering on Yang Ruiyi’s face for a moment. The brief pause felt like a blade scraping across Yang Ruiyi’s heart. Finally, Cheng Xunzhi spoke.

“I was delayed by Daoist Master Chunshuo of the Golden Feather Sect. I was a step too slow.”

His words seemed to be an explanation for the lingering Jade True qi in the air, and a statement of fact for Yang Ruiyi. He then began to walk, treading across the Exiled Qi and brilliant light in the sky. He collected the jade stones in a box and slowly vanished toward the southern horizon, eventually becoming a tiny speck of gold.

Only then did Yang Ruiyi slowly let out a breath. But an urgent cry suddenly rang out.

“Grand General… Grand General… I beg you, save him!”

Startled, Yang Ruiyi quickly turned to see Daoist Master Cheng Qian rushing forward. The tears in the young man’s eyes had not yet dried, but there was no time for grief.

“Please, Grand General, save my master!”

Yang Ruiyi’s gaze flickered. He turned to the other side, where Xianyao’s expression was ashen, like a mask of white porcelain shrouded in a faint, dark light. He was barely holding himself aloft in mid-air. Powerful divine abilities were pouring from his wounds while halos of multicolored light circled behind his head, making him look like a celestial being.

The sight was undoubtedly beautiful, but to the two Daoist Masters, it was terrifying.

“His six senses are collapsing from within, his spiritual essence bleeding into the world…”

The old Daoist Master was already nearing the end of his lifespan. After joining the Great Song, he had consumed numerous life-extending pills just to survive this long. A cultivator so close to his end was supposed to be in quiet seclusion. How could he possibly withstand such a high-intensity battle?
These were the signs of a lamp about to flicker out.

Yang Ruiyi hurriedly channeled black qi, tapping the old man’s face six times. The layer of dark light slowly dissipated. He then took out a medicinal pill and gave it to him. Xianyao coughed up a mouthful of black blood, and some color slowly returned to his face.

“Many thanks, Grand General!”

Yang Ruiyi stared at him for a moment before turning to Cheng Qian, his expression pained.

“Return to Overlook Peak at once and rest!”

This was tantamount to telling him to prepare for the end. Even though Cheng Qian had expected it, the words washed over him like a bucket of ice water, from his head to his toes. He stared blankly at Yang Ruiyi.

Yang Ruiyi’s mind was in turmoil, and he misinterpreted the look. He sent a message via his divine ability.

“After you have arranged the old master’s final affairs… you can return here to find me.”

Cheng Qian seemed to snap out of his daze. He averted his gaze, bowed, and without another word, supported the old Daoist Master as they began the long journey toward their sect’s gate in the Eastern Sea.

Yang Ruiyi watched his departing back, and the breath he had just swallowed caught in his chest again, feeling like a block of eternal ice that crushed the air from his lungs.

But what could he do?

‘Whether it’s Li Zhouwei, Cheng Xunzhi, Liu Bai, or Xianyao… of course this is all my fault… who else could be blamed?’

His lips were pale as he raised a hand with a complicated expression, watching the Jade True light stream through his fingers. He murmured to himself,

‘Was it really necessary… to eliminate a future threat… I could have just exhausted your life-mandate, severed your path to the Purple Mystery… I already reacted as fast as I could… I clearly made it in time…’

Liu Bai guarding this place was a tacit agreement between the Way of Great Desire and the Yang clan. The Way of Great Desire coveted him, and by having him defend the mountain alone, he could tie up all their forces at Tangdao Mountain, preventing them from interfering in the great war between the north and south. This was precisely why the slave Nuzi, forcefully summoned by Qi Lanyan, had fallen so easily without drawing any intervention from the Way of Great Desire!

Meanwhile, his own father was wary of this rapidly rising descendant of the Chu State and had long harbored a desire to suppress him. As the one tasked with carrying out the Yang clan’s interests, Yang Ruiyi was caught in an unimaginably contradictory and awkward position. He had, of course, thought of saving Liu Bai in time—even if his path to the Dao was lost, at least his life could be saved…

He had raced a thousand li to arrive before Cheng Xunzhi and prevent the situation from escalating, but he had also acted out of a sliver of selfish intent.

But the result had clearly been beyond his expectations.

His pupils dilated slightly. The final, mocking smile of the Jade True sword cultivator within the golden palm still lingered in his mind. Yang Ruiyi didn’t know what Tian Langzhi had said in the end, but he understood with deep certainty that the last surviving Daoist Master of the Chu-Liu line had probably understood everything long ago.

Yang Ruiyi stood rooted to the spot, a chill seeping into his limbs.

‘Better to be shattered jade than an intact tile.’

The Exiled Qi continued to roil and boil in the sky, seething with a thick, palpable fury. Yang Ruiyi squeezed his eyes shut, his heart aching.

‘Or perhaps… it was…’

…

“It was that he would rather fall on the spot than fail to rip off a corner of their feigned, whitewashed masks!”

“Cheng Qian was watching, Cheng Xunzhi was watching… and who knows, maybe even Li Zhouwei and that Emperor of the Great Song were watching too!”

The Great Void was a kaleidoscope of colors. The shock had still not faded from Wang Ziya’s eyes. He held the scroll painting, feeling an immense pressure in his heart. Beside him, a gentle white mist took the shape of a leaping beast, from which a voice emerged.

“Tian Langzhi helped him achieve it, too. Putting on a show, risking his life to delay them for that moment… his hatred for the south is no weaker than anyone else’s…”

“Truly disrespectful…” Wang Ziya’s tone was complex, but it didn’t sound like a reprimand. Wei Xuanyin retracted his light and sighed.

“Back when the Chu-Liu clan was destroyed, the Yang clan received orders to act as the mortal hand that pushed them to their doom. They left a branch in Southern Yue holding the military tally, which is how we have the Liu Bai of today. To the great powers, he wasn't worthy of notice, but for the Yang family, with the world in such utter chaos, they had to prevent future troubles.”

“After all, Liu Bai harbored a grudge.”

Wang Ziya’s gaze fell upon the scroll in his palm, his expression desolate.

“No wonder they sent me.”

His heart felt heavy.

“Yang Ruiyi can’t be feeling good either… this war has shaken the north and south. At least four mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have fallen… not to mention countless others of lesser rank… Who won? No one won. It seems to me this bloodshed was just exchanged for more bloodshed. Every family is weeping.”

“At least they have tears to shed.”

Wei Xuanyin, however, was already accustomed to such things, or perhaps he had long since seen the true nature of this war. He glanced at the scroll and asked,

“Is this the true form of the True Monarch of Nurturing Life and Prosperous Treasures?”

Wang Ziya nodded silently.

“Disciple-brother is truly learned!”

Wei Xuanyin shook his head.

“I know a thing or two about True Monarch Chilang’s affair of the ‘Son’s Oath’.”

It was an event from the distant past. Back then, True Monarch Chilang had not yet achieved the Dao. He lived under an assumed name, had traveled far from home, and had become a disciple under Xu Xiang. He was known for his unyielding temperament. True Monarch Xu Xiang was at odds with the Buddhists, so Chilang became a vanguard in suppressing them.

At that time, Tongxuan Palace was being established. True Monarch Xu Xiang moved to observe the ceremony, closing his six senses and erecting a pavilion with his bare hands. Chilang, finally free, returned home for the first time in fifty years. Unexpectedly, the ‘Tianwu Revered One’ was spreading his teachings in the mortal world and passed through his hometown. His young grandson, drawn by the excitement, went to the temple to pay respects to the Buddhists and was seen by Chilang upon his return. Chilang was incredulous, then enraged.

For years, he had stayed on the mountain under a false name, practicing cultivation to spare his family from the karmic consequences of his path. Yet, every year, he sent letters home, instructing his family’s descendants to diligently study Daoist methods and not stray onto the wrong path. But his family only knew he had gone to some mountain to cultivate; they didn’t know he had attained divine abilities and had never taken his words to heart. They had even invited a Master Monk into their home!

Chilang was furious. He seized the monk, only to find he was a mere mortal. He could only banish him. Believing his grandson was young and ignorant, and that his eldest son had been lax in his teachings, he cut off his son’s ears as punishment. Then he forced him to swear an oath before the ancestral patriarch’s statue.

‘The descendants of my line shall not follow their base nature, nor accept Buddhist teachings. They shall not dissect illusion, nor speak of ultimate truth. If any violate this oath, they shall be executed before the Treasured Earth.’

It was because of this oath that, whether during the spread of Buddhist law into the Central Plains or in later eras of karmic defilement, no one from the Chu-Liu lineage had ever turned to the Buddhist path.

Wang Ziya affirmed his words, saying softly, “My master went to Dongmu Heaven to see the lord and mentioned that my cultivation had stagnated, my qi circulation blocked. I had already sought emptiness to refine the Dao, switched to cultivating the Purple Gold, and entered this mortal world… then a disciple-brother spoke up…”

“He said he had calculated for a long time that a descendant of the Liu clan was about to enter the Buddhist Land. There should have been a reaction from the oath, but it was being blocked by Martial Cultivation. He suggested I bring the patriarch’s statue down to Jiangnan and show it to him face-to-face, to make him die by the oath.”

Wei Xuanyin hesitated a moment.

“If that was truly the case, from what I saw, the Way of Great Desire’s Buddhist Land was advancing with overwhelming momentum. If you hadn’t come, Daoist friend, there would have been a true summoning light…”

Wang Ziya’s voice was bitter.

“Indeed. I made sure he saw me, intending to extinguish that sliver of desire to join the Buddhists. To be selfish, it was because my Numinous Treasure Order was unwilling to lose face. On a personal level, I couldn’t bear to see him become a Buddhist and hoped he could retain some dignity… but he took his own life so decisively! Ai!”

A trace of admiration rose in Wei Xuanyin’s eyes. He then offered comfort,

“The situation now is beyond your control. Preserving the dignity of the Numinous Treasure Order is already fortunate. The matter with Vast Cicada crossed a line, and the powers that be wanted to retaliate. What has happened now is enough for the Yang family to swallow their loss and suffer in silence.”

Hearing this, Wang Ziya felt a measure of peace, though the image of the Jade True cultivator still occupied his mind. His gaze was complicated.

“In ancient times, Encompassing Profoundity was established separately, yet one could still temper their heart in the mortal world, and Divine Monarchs arose in droves. It wasn’t some special favor from the heavenly Dao… ‘There are no heroes in the grotto-heavens.’ Those words say it all!”

Wei Xuanyin had heard this saying before and was not surprised. He raised an eyebrow and said,

“In this world, one seeks the Quest for Gold to attain a position. Whether seeking or attaining, it’s nothing more than a manifestation, an aura. Once you hide away in a grotto-heaven, it’s all just about leisurely seeking immortality. What other kinds of manifestations can there be? I came from the mortal world, and I will prove my worth in the mortal world.”

Wang Ziya fell silent at his words. After a long pause, he said,

“That saying is not appropriate for these times.”

Wei Xuanyin also grew quiet. Seeing the slope of the Great Void grow steeper, Wang Ziya indicated his intent to leave.

“This tempering in the mortal world has brought me great enlightenment. Disciple-brother Wei… do you have further plans?”

Wei Xuanyin nodded, then paused.

“I’m going to Shanji.”

Wang Ziya froze, alarmed.

“That’s not a good idea!”

The man in white robes smiled.

“Since I’ve come to the Profound Governance Pavilion and seen the Zhaoyao Mountain lineage, she must call me senior. I can’t simply ignore this matter. I’ll wait in the mountains. If she has the will to leave the mortal world and return to the mountains, I will bring her back, even if it means offending the Yang family.”

Wang Ziya, who had been about to step away, immediately retracted his foot. He felt a headache coming on. It seemed every Daoist Master he had met since leaving the grotto-heaven was more shocking than the last.

‘Perhaps the mortal world is so treacherous that one must be shockingly unconventional to transcend it.’

But he had always been a good-natured person, just an old Daoist in a temple back in the grotto-heaven. Even knowing the other man was far more calculating than himself, he still tried to dissuade him.

“The matter in Shanji has dragged on for too long, and the Yang clan’s resentment runs deep. This isn’t like the incidents at Lake Xian or the siege of Tangdao Mountain, which were just the schemes of one or two underworld officials with the Yang surname… If this involves Yang Zhuo’s destiny, I estimate that even Judge Yang himself is paying attention!”

“Offending the Yang family is a small matter, but offending Judge Yang is a grave one. If you dare to probe into this… if you displease the lord…”

Wei Xuanyin lowered his hand.

“I see it differently.”

His expression was distant as he mused,

“I have observed that Yang Zhuo’s destiny bears a vicious aspect—wings beating, beak sharp and sinister, a figure bent and exiled, bearing injustice and harboring grievances… And while the Underworld in the south is notoriously ruthless, they are usually meticulous when employing someone, only casting them aside like worn-out shoes when they are no longer useful. It is rare to see them act with such disregard…”

“I fear they never intended to treat him as a monarch.”
