# Chapter 939: Owing Nothing

Li Qinghong waited in the hall for a while before Li Chenghuai arrived with a youth. The young man wore a silver-feather thunder robe whose collar was embroidered with purple patterns. A sword hung at his waist, and his eyes shone with piercing light.

He spotted Li Qinghong the moment he entered and clasped his hands in a formal salute. His voice was clear and his speech was crisp and decisive as he said aloud, "Xi Zikang, a thunder cultivator from the Northern Sea, greets you, fellow Daoist!"

Li Qinghong nodded slightly and replied softly, "I am Li Qinghong. Well met, fellow Daoist."

"I have long heard of your great name." Xi Zikang had his black hair tied back, with a faint purple mark on his fair forehead. He appeared youthful and gave off a bright aura. His age was unclear, but his gaze was pure as he spoke gently, "I reside in the Northern Sea and have heard of the Zhao-Yue conflict. As I journeyed south, I wished to first pay a visit to your esteemed family."

Li Qinghong didn’t know his background, but the youth was courteous, and as a thunder cultivator, he naturally didn’t give off any ill feelings. She nodded and said, "Our household has encountered some upheaval. I apologize if the reception is lacking..."

After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Xi Zikang considered his words before speaking in a steady voice, "My family has long resided in the Northern Sea, and have been cultivating the Profound Thunder Dao for over eight hundred years. We have some foundation but lack in Celestial Thunder arts. One of my purposes for this visit is to exchange for such arts with your esteemed family."

He had chosen a mild topic to open the discussion. Li Qinghong took a small sip of tea, feeling her thoughts settle. The Li Family had two Celestial Thunder arts, both derived from the Profound Thunderpool. One was the third-grade Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique; the other was an ancient method, the Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique. Both started from third-grade, neither reaching fifth-grade. Li Qinghong had also cultivated them.

There’s nothing that can’t be offered in exchange, thought Li Qinghong.

Simply put, the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique wasn’t considered powerful by the current standards of the Li Family. While it was strong for a third-grade technique, it shortened one’s lifespan and cut off descendants. What truly held value were the three Profound Thunders, the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique.

Moreover... could someone travel thousands of kilometers just for one technique? My arts stem from the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling, so it’s not hard to guess. He’s probably here for the grotto heaven and is merely sounding things out.

Li Qinghong had always felt a faint gloom surrounding the Thundercloud Grotto Heaven. So she nodded courteously and replied, "Very well. Our family is also facing hard times, and your family’s thunder arts belong to the righteous Dao. As long as we agree on the price, there’s no issue in proceeding."

Xi Zikang smiled faintly and said softly, "I’d like to take a look at the opening scroll first."

Li Qinghong summoned someone to bring out the jade slip. The Li Family had long prepared recorded excerpts for the younger generation to choose from, so there was no need to transcribe anything anew. Xi Zikang waited a while, and when a crisp chime echoed at the front of the hall, Radiant Light shimmered as a young cultivator stepped inside.

The cultivator wore a white Daoist robe with a gray-golden inner layer. His features were upright and handsome. His eyes were slightly open, and celestial light flowed gently around him. He raised his brow and gave Li Qinghong a formal bow. Someone behind him brought in the jade slip.

"Li Ximing of the Moongaze Li Family."

Xi Zikang noticed his slightly hoarse voice, but his tone was calm, so he paid it no mind. He turned over the jade slip in his hand and read it. Surprise flickered across his brows as he said, "Profound Thunderpool? Is this your technique, fellow Daoist?"

Li Qinghong’s Immortal Foundation wasn’t a secret, so she simply acknowledged it. Xi Zikang hesitated and said, "To be honest, I’ve also heard of this Immortal Foundation... it belongs to the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling."

He raised his brows and looked at Li Qinghong, speaking gently, "This method is a substitute for Celestial Thunder’s Winter Thunderclap, but it’s called Profound Thunderpool. It seeks to reconcile with Profound Heaven, which was typical of the Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling Dao."

Li Qinghong listened attentively and replied thoughtfully, "Your esteemed family has a long heritage. Do you know why this Dao developed in such a way?"

"Ah!" Xi Zikang’s tone carried a hint of bitterness as he replied, "It’s not exactly a secret. Everyone from south to north knows the world has five virtues, and that there are Profound, Celestial and Origin thunders. Yet for generations, we thunder cultivators have never understood why there are five for water and fire, but only three for thunder?

"Even if that’s the way of heaven and earth, Profound and Celestial governs thunder, and Origin Thunder is also called Prime Magnetism. Logically, there should be a fourth thunder governing magnetism to complement the dualities of nature..."

Seeing Li Qinghong nod thoughtfully, Xi Zikang continued with a sigh, "So many predecessors have tried to prove it, suspecting that a Dao Fruit was lost at the beginning of creation. The Profound Thunderpool is one such attempt..."

"I see." Li Qinghong gradually understood, So it’s no coincidence that the two Profound Thunder items, Duruo and the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens, suit me so well. My Immortal Foundation itself is the result of many rounds of refinement...

She went over it once more in her head, then asked, "If this Dao truly exists, then there must be corresponding spirit items and demonic creatures birthed with the same Immortal Foundation. How could they not appear?"

Xi Zikang was momentarily speechless. Clearly, he did not have a solid grasp of such secrets and could only say, "I’ve only heard some rumors. In ancient times, Immortal Lords were everywhere. Those with supreme cultivation could transcend Fruition Attainment, borrowing from and hiding things within heaven and earth, thereby altering the world. Maybe one thunder was hidden away by an Immortal Lord long ago."

His tone was hesitant, clearly uncertain of the truth.

Li Qinghong nodded, and Xi Zikang added, "My family has an abundance of thunder-related items. If you have any needs, Qinghong, I can try requesting something from home."

Li Qinghong paused. At the moment, she couldn’t think of any spirit items her family lacked, so she said, "It’s better to exchange technique for technique. Your family has a deep foundation, do you have any Bright Yang Dao techniques?"

Xi Zikang was slightly surprised. After a moment of thought, he replied, "My family doesn’t have one, but we are under the Northern Sea’s Beihuan Sect. I can request a Foundation Establishment Realm technique from the upper sect. If I send a formal letter, there should be options to choose from."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing, who had been listening silently at the side, finally nodded. Li Qinghong’s eyes lit up as she thought to herself, So technique control in the Northern Sea is this relaxed? They can even request techniques from the Immortal Sect and resell them?!

She had also heard of the Beihuan Sect’s reputation and said gently, "Very well! In that case, since our family has some additional items, I hope we can exchange for a few more volumes."

"Well..." Xi Zikang hesitated and said softly, "These things aren’t really presentable... the techniques won’t be top-tier either... please don’t expect too much, Qinghong..."

When he saw that Li Qinghong and her nephew seemed confused, he shook his head awkwardly. It was clearly a private matter, so Li Qinghong refrained from pressing further. Xi Zikang then smiled and said, "Then let’s consider that matter settled! There’s one more thing, I’d like to ask if I may take a look at the dharma artifact in your possession."

Xi Zikang seemed aware that his request was excessive, and a deep look of apology showed on his face. Li Qinghong, however, didn’t seem angry. She immediately understood what he meant and asked, "The Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens?"

"Exactly!" Xi Zikang quickly said, "That item... holds great importance to my family. When it was first recovered from the ruins of Thundercloud Temple beneath the sea, one of my ancestors dueled the Azure Pond Sect’s Master Buzi. Both were in Foundation Establishment Realm then... he lost by a narrow margin and still regrets it to this day... I hope you might allow me to examine it briefly!"

Li Qinghong couldn’t quite gauge his true intent. Her priority was to obtain that cultivation technique first; all else could wait. So she replied softly, "You’re a newcomer here, and I must admit I still feel some caution. Let’s postpone this for now. Once our families have exchanged techniques and understand each other better, we can revisit the matter."

Xi Zikang could only sigh softly and nod in agreement. After a few more casual remarks, he prepared to take his leave.

Li Qinghong nodded at Li Ximing, signaling him to leave first. Only then did Xi Zikang rise and casually say, "It’s a bit of a coincidence. I, too, cultivate the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling. My Immortal Foundation is called Heaven’s Crying Spur. This trip, I’m heading south to Lake Xian, then turning east toward the Eastern Sea."

Li Qinghong sighed inwardly and asked, "What business takes you there?"

Xi Zikang shook his head with a smile and said, "You and I both cultivate with borrowed Dao lineages. Surely, you’ve had your own doubts, so why ask me? The dragon kin devour thunder, and such a prolonged Falling Water Rising Storm must mean unfinished business. My sect informed me long ago, so I traveled south voluntarily to spare the Dragon Monarch the trouble of dragging me down and harming my kin..."

Li Qinghong escorted him out all the way to the island’s edge. She saw thunder bloom beneath Xi Zikang’s feet as he turned and said softly, "It’s not all bad. There’s no need for them to kill us all. There may be benefits to come. When the time comes, I’ll seek you out, Qinghong. If we go together, at least we’ll have each other’s company."

Li Qinghong fell silent for a moment, watching him depart. Then she rode thunder back to the peak, where she happened to run into Li Ximing. He said softly, "Aunt... he seems to have an ulterior motive."

Li Qinghong had sensed the same. This man had shown no real urgency for the technique, and his request about the artifact seemed more like a pretext. It was perhaps just a way to build rapport. The information he later revealed likely mattered far more.

As for his final remarks before leaving, those were probably the real reason he had come. Li Qinghong understood this well and didn’t explain further. She only replied softly, "Don’t worry. Are you doing better?"

"You need not worry, Aunt." Li Ximing’s tone was gentle. He had shaved the beard he used to keep, and his body brimmed with Radiant Light. Li Qinghong had rarely heard such a tone from him, so she was slightly surprised. The young man cupped his hands and said softly, "Aunt, I’m going into seclusion for cultivation."

Li Qinghong responded with a quiet "Mm," and watched him ascend toward Mount Wu, where the spiritual energy was most abundant along the shoreline. The hall fell silent. The woman sat alone for a moment, then rose and returned to her dwelling.

On Pingya Island.

Morning light leaped over the distant mountains, spilling golden rays across the lake. Pingya Island was relatively flat, with connected isles, drifting white mist, and rows of pavilions and towers laid out in graceful order. It radiated the atmosphere of an immortal domain.

The grand hall at the island’s peak gleamed in the morning light. Li Chenghuai walked up the stairs one by one and entered. The carved flying beasts at the eaves had faintly red eyes and four bared teeth. It was a sign of vigorous fire veins. He calculated with his fingers and thought, Summer is near, today is an auspicious day. The Celestial Whirl generation is to receive teachings and breath arts... a well-chosen date.

With both Li Ximing and Li Qinghong in seclusion, time flowed like water. This was the Li Family’s first formal instruction ceremony since unifying Moongaze Lake. Li Chenghuai, master of Qingdu Peak, one of the two peaks among the sixteen prefectures, had arrived early, as expected.

Inside the main hall, someone had already arrived and stood with hands clasped behind his back, studying a map intently. He wore a deep red robe with golden embroidery and had discarded the heavy overrobe for summer. He looked clean-cut and decisive.
𝕗𝚛𝚎𝚎𝐰𝗲𝗯𝗻𝚘𝚟𝚎𝗹.𝕔𝐨𝕞

The design had been settled by the two brothers. Li Chenghuai naturally recognized this as the garb of the family head. Dark red with gold, it symbolized the family’s axis. His own robe was outer blue with inner white, the mark of Qingdu’s chief, representing the family's formal leadership.

The Li Family governed sixteen prefectures, two peaks, and one mountain. All peak chiefs of the sixteen prefectures wore red robes. The two peaks had distinct colors where, Qingdu, which represented the clan chief, was outer blue and inner white. Jade Court, which represented the enforcers, was pale with gray. It was visually clear at a glance.

As for the great mountain of Milin, it was too vast to be entrusted lightly. It remained vacant to this day, and the designated purple robes had yet to be used.

Li Chenghuai ascended several steps and saluted Li Chengliao, speaking softly, "Family Head, the Celestial Whirl generation and the younger members of the prominent families from the sixteen prefectures have all arrived outside the hall."

Most of the Li Family’s Celestial Whirl generation had now stepped onto the Dao of cultivation. The eldest, Li Zhoufang of the first lineage, was twenty-six and had reached the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Li Chengliao had met most of them and said plainly, "Let them enter."

Most of the Radiant Lure generation had attained cultivation, but many had died in battle in the north, leaving few heirs. As a result, the Celestial Whirl generation was not only small in number but there were even fewer among them with the innate ability to qualify for the main hall. When Li Chengliao looked over them, he saw fewer than ten.

"In all great families, it’s common to see sparse descendants and mutual adoption... It’s true. Once one attains cultivation, having children becomes harder, especially after Qi Cultivation Realm or Foundation Establishment Realm..."

It wasn’t entirely a bad thing. Li Chengliao had long observed that ties across three to five generations within the family often grew distant. But with adoptions, relations that had drifted apart were drawn close once more. The four branches had become notably more united.

He pondered quietly, Some great families endure for centuries. Adoption must be a crucial strategy for them...

He put his thoughts away as those below bowed. The one in the lead looked no older than sixteen and was also at the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Li Chenghuai nodded slightly, a smile forming on his face.

This youth was the only descendant of the seasonal branch: his eldest son, Li Zhouluo.

Li Zhouluo had gray eyes and long brows, with the poise of a young man. Dressed in black pleated robes, he spoke with confidence. Though Li Chenghuai himself was plain in looks, his wife, Madam Ding, was beautiful, and their son had inherited the best of both parents, appearing elegant and refined.

Li Chenghuai had never been fond of long seclusions, so Li Zhouluo had grown up to be well-mannered and courteous by his side. Watching from the side, his father felt a warm satisfaction.

If Father saw him, he’d surely be pleased, thought Li Chenghuai.

Last time his father, Li Xizhi, returned home, he hadn’t said a word to him. Li Chenghuai had long since grown used to it. Now in his thirties, he no longer minded and often forgot about him. Yet thinking of him now, he felt a faint daze, Father...

By his count, he had only seen his father a handful of times since childhood. The man rode mists and rainbows and was a prominent figure in the sect. But when Li Chenghuai thought of his father, it was mostly confusion.

I owe him nothing, and he owes me nothing. That’s all there is to it.

Standing atop the steps, gazing down at those in the grand hall, Li Chenghuai knew exactly where everything he had come from, and he also knew he hadn’t lost much. He never harbored resentment, but on rare occasions like this, when they came to mind, he quietly thought, I often forget them. They probably don’t often remember me either and that’s just how it is.
