# Chapter 711: Divine Ability

Azure Pond Sect.

The main hall of Azure Pond Sect was grand and towering, shrouded in ethereal mist. White jade steps led upward and radiant spirit lamps glowed brightly. White spiritual qi flowed like fog. Chi Zhiyun was descending the steps when he saw a middle-aged man approaching with steady, relaxed steps. He simply asked, "What is it?"

The man was naturally Ning Hejing. He clasped his hands and replied, "Reporting to the sect master, the people from Green Pine Island have returned... They met a few individuals. Li Xizhi’s younger sister said he went to the Han Family but has since disappeared.

"Later, others went to the Han Family, but that family claimed Li Xizhi had left early and only sent some Han Family members to investigate the Qunyi Sea."

Ning Hejing paused, then continued, "Following the trail, we heard that Li Xizhi had accepted an invitation from Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak Gate and went to Xia Mountain to gather Dawn Colored Qi on behalf of Daoist Master Changxi. As for the two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of the Han Family, they are most likely already dead."

Chi Zhiyun listened quietly, his expression somewhat intriguing. He merely asked, "So you're saying Li Xizhi never went near Thundercloud Temple, but instead went straight to Profound Peak Gate... Interesting."

Ning Hejing bowed his head in response, then heard Chi Zhiyun murmur, "Could it be that Changxi made a move?"

A hesitant look appeared on Ning Hejing’s face, but Chi Zhiyun quickly shook his head and said, "It likely wasn't that Daoist. He hasn't cultivated a Life Divine Ability and wouldn't dare meddle in Azure Pond’s affairs..."

Both of them were direct disciples of an immortal sect, with elders from the Purple Mansion Realm in their families. So they were well-versed in Purple Mansion divine abilities and the various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Jiangnan.

Though all Purple Mansion Realm cultivators forged divine abilities, not all abilities were of the same type. They spanned a wide range which included Body Divine Ability, Life Divine Ability, and Eye Divine Ability... each possessed its own marvels, but the most crucial was the Life Divine Ability.

The Life Divine Ability was key to how Purple Mansion Realm cultivators touched upon fate. It resembled many techniques of Buddhist cultivators. It could confuse the heart and question the mind, subtly influence the course of events or discern traces of omens to deduce the truth.

Though it was rare for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to clash outright, except for those few at the peak, it was only those with a Life Divine Ability who could truly be considered players in the game. It was a true threshold.

Because each sect’s Daoist Masters wielded different divine abilities, the immortal sects also varied in strength. For example, Purple Smoke Gate had two peak Purple Mansion Realm Daoists and was vaguely considered the strongest beneath the top three sects. Meanwhile, the weakest, Snow Ji Gate, had its Purple Mansion Realm cultivator missing for years and even its disciples no longer dared show their faces.

Several of Azure Pond Sect’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivators possessed Life Divine Abilities. Back then, among the so-called Azure Pond Three Primordials, Yuan Su was the most renowned. He was known not only for his immensely powerful seal, but also for his divine ability, Spring’s Echo of the Pristine Water, which was both a Body and Life Divine Ability. It was an exceedingly mystical art.

As for Daoist Master Changxi, his cultivated divine ability was Fool's Mountain Chase, a rare art-type divine ability that was not suited for offense. In recent years, he’d stagnated due to the lack of techniques and had always been the most unassuming among the seven sects. Naturally, Chi Zhiyun had no reason to suspect him.

After pondering for a moment, Ning Hejing asked, "Could it be Daoist Master Chuting...?"

At the mention of Xiao Chuting, both of their expressions grew uneasy. Xiao Chuting had not appeared in years, yet he remained a figure that inspired apprehension.

This Daoist Master had clawed his way into the Purple Mansion Realm from narrow odds, struggling with every step. But later, he moved with grace and ease. By now, he had become someone all sides sought to win over.

Chi Zhiyun's expression darkened but he still shook his head and said softly, "If Xiao Chuting had made a move, it wouldn’t need to be done like this... Besides, he’s been in the Northern Sea this whole time, likely with Yuan Xiu over in Cangzhou. There's no way he could be manipulating events in the Eastern Sea from across thousands of miles..."

Ning Hejing fell silent for several seconds before finally saying, "I don’t understand how he dared go to the Northern Sea!"

Chi Zhiyun replied in a low voice, "It’s the grand occasion of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator attempting a breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm. Xiao Chuting wouldn’t want to miss that. Besides... his cultivation is aligned with Pit Water, and Cangzhou has the strongest Pit Water. This is a rare opportunity for him."

Ning Hejing parted his lips slightly, his voice barely above a whisper, "What you say is true, sect master... but... Xiao Xianyou’s death back then was suspicious, it was likely at the hands of Shangyuan. The ones below dare not speak of it, the Xiao Family dare not acknowledge it, but Xiao Chuting must know! If I were him, I wouldn’t even dare set foot in the north..."

Chi Zhiyun’s expression turned worse as he replied curtly, "Enough talk! How many were involved in the Donghua and Li Jiangqun affair back then? It wasn’t just Xiao Xianyou, even that one from Purple Smoke Gate was part of it too. Yuanwu, Yuan Xiu... which of them didn’t have a hand in it? There’s no reason he wouldn’t dare to go to Yue Cultivating Sect.

"Shangyuan was brought up by Donghua... but would he dare do anything? If you ask me, even if he became a Golden Core Realm cultivator, he wouldn’t dare say much about this matter..."

Ning Hejing could only nod repeatedly. As the two briefly touched upon events from centuries ago, a chill ran through their hearts. Chi Zhiyun reined in his emotions and came to a conclusion, "If Li Xizhi truly didn’t go, it’s ninety percent likely due to coincidence... but there’s still that sliver of possibility..."

Ning Hejing nodded slightly and spoke in a low voice, "It’s also possible the man was just putting on a show... He never truly intended to investigate Yuan Tuan’s case, which is why he let himself get sidetracked so easily... After all, once Yuan Tuan died, Qingsui Peak fell into his hands."

Chi Zhiyun nodded ambiguously, seemingly holding back other thoughts. He waved Ning Hejing away and sat alone in his seat.

After waiting a moment, he rose on the wind and flew to the top of Azure Pond Peak. There, white mist cloaked the summit and clouds drifted dreamily. He entered the veil and made his way to the deepest part of the cave dwelling.

At the deepest point was a clear, luminous pool. Chi Zhiyun examined the surroundings carefully and then gently formed a spell seal.

Lines of glowing inscriptions lit up rapidly across the cave’s stone walls, spreading densely to seal off the inside from the outside. The faint fluctuations they gave off were immensely powerful. It was a Purple Mansion Realm formation that even isolated the surrounding void.

Only then did Chi Zhiyun bend down, eyes burning with fervor as he gazed at the deep pool. After waiting for a full quarter-hour, a reflection slowly emerged in the once pitch-black water.

Though above the pool was nothing but bare blue rock, the water reflected a small tree that was silver-white and dazzling. Delicate and beautiful leaves shimmered like silver threads, rising and falling gently with the ripples in the pool.

Soft moonlight began to drift outward. Chi Zhiyun gazed silently at the small tree within the pool as he calculated the days in his mind and his heart filled with growing joy. He murmured, "It’s close... so close... it’s about to bear fruit... Buzi hoarded them every time, no matter how much I begged, he wouldn’t give me even one. But now that bastard has gone missing. At last, I have the chance to consume this fruit... just a little more time..."

As he calculated silently, the small tree within the pool stretched gently as if it was breathing. It released a soft and radiant moonlight shine. Around the pool’s edge, wisps of orchid grass sprouted which exuded a pleasant fragrance.

Yi Mountain City.

The ancient walls of Yi Mountain City were weathered, etched with countless traces of runes. A group of guards atop the walls looked downward. The desolate land before the gates was littered with white bones. A few crows had landed on the barren ground and were cawing harshly.

Above them stood a group of youths in luxurious robes, starkly contrasting with the family cultivators at their sides. One of them even sat suspended in midair, holding a wine cup and was leisurely admiring the view.

To the guards, Yi Mountain City was a place where lives were gambled. But to these Azure Pond Sect disciples, it was merely a site for bartering with demonic creatures and tempering disciples. It was hardly something to fear.

A few of them were in a playful mood, they were chatting and drinking atop the city wall. Slightly left of center sat a youth who seemed tipsy. He was leaning lazily against the wall.

His robe was loose and he straddled the steps as he tilted his head while raising his cup. His gray-black eyes were dazed with intoxication. This was Li Yuanqin, son of Li Xuanfeng in the southern border. He was seated at the center of the group.

The group chatted boisterously about amusing stories from various families and who in which immortal sect had obtained new fortunes. One man drank and said with a laugh, "Brother Yuanqin, you carry that bow on your back every day. Why not take a shot and let us see how much of your father's skill you’ve inherited?"

Li Yuanqin sneered at the comment, unstrapped the bow from his back and tossed it casually to the man as he said, "What skill could I have? It's just for show."

The group exchanged glances and, in unspoken agreement, shifted the topic. Soon, someone brought up a joke and said, "I heard there’ve been big changes in the southern border recently. Several of the shaman kingdoms near the northern edge are warring with each other. Rumor has it they’re trying to form some kind of major sect... Quite a strange thing."

The southern border wasn’t entirely ruled by demonic creatures, only Yi Mountain City faced their territory directly. The borderlands stretched for thousands of miles, running near Wu State and even bordering the territory of the Golden Feather Sect.

There were many shaman kingdoms in that region and most were raised by demonic creatures as a food source. Some were obscure minor factions, many of which perished during the devil plague.

"Weren’t there already many minor sects in that area...?" One of them asked.

Those tiny sects and humble temples were nothing compared to the massive Three Sects and Seven Gates. Most were founded by Qi Cultivation Realm rogue cultivators, nestled in the vast wilderness between Wu State and the southern border. They rose and fell with each day. He wore a nostalgic expression and murmured, "I think there used to be a fairly decent faction back then... called Slaughter... Slaughter Jun Gate?"

How could news of those minor sects from the wastelands reach the ears of these direct descendents? Thinking it over, only one came to mind, Slaughter Jun Gate. It had once gone unnoticed but now was known across the world thanks to Tu Longjian. Everyone seemed to understand the implication.

They brushed past that side topic and finally someone chuckled and asked, "So I’ve heard Daoist Master Shangyuan is attempting to break through to the Golden Core Realm. Gentlemen... have your families heard any inside news?"

Upon hearing that, Li Yuanqin's hazy eyes instantly focused. He quietly fixed his gaze on his wine cup as a member of the Chi Family spoke, "What news could there be? Even Duanmu Kui failed... what chance does Shangyuan really have?"

As soon as he said this, a man of higher status and finer clothing beside him sneered and replied softly, "Cousin, you're amusing. Shangyuan has the support of that one from Yue Cultivating Sect. What does Duanmu Kui have? Just one immortal text. He’s good in a fight, sure, but can that help him break through?"

The Chi Family member who spoke earlier clearly wasn’t aligned with him and immediately retorted, "Even an immortal once said he'd reach the Golden Core Realm. So what happened to him now?"

A chorus of voices erupted into noisy debate. Li Yuanqin stayed silent and glanced at the Ning Family members present. Their expressions were no better, each of them wore a gloomy face and drank heavily.

The reason was simple. Just a few days ago, Daoist Master Yuan Su had personally appointed Ning Heyuan as head of the family and peak master of the Immortal Peak. With Ning Heyuan receiving such authority, it was clear to the Ning Family that Daoist Master Yuan Su’s time was nearing its end.

With their own pillar faltering, none were in the mood for jokes. The Ning Family members wore somber expressions. Li Yuanqin listened quietly until the group settled on a shared question, "Where is Daoist Master Yuan Xiu now?"

With Purple Mansion elders in the sect seemingly about to fall one after another, the whereabouts of Yuan Xiu, whose condition remained unknown, suddenly became a hot topic. All eyes turned to one person in the corner.

The man had thick brows and large eyes, sitting in the corner with a cheerful smile. A member of the Chi Family spoke up, "Brother Si Honglang... Do you know anything? Let us hear it..."

Si Honglang didn’t have much talent nor any outstanding traits and usually remained unnoticed among the crowd. But now he finally had his moment and said proudly, "Our Daoist Master is skilled in longevity techniques, and he’s the youngest among the Three Primordials. He still has plenty of time!"

The crowd burst into laughter, but the leading Chi Family member suddenly fell silent as a golden figure flew toward them and landed slowly in front of the city wall. His expression was stern as his gaze swept over the group.

Most of the young nobles lost their nerve, backing away with bowed heads. Only a few Chi Family direct descendants stood their ground, cupped their hands and respectfully called out, "Greetings, General. Brother Yuanqin is here."

Li Xuanfeng immediately spotted Li Yuanqin where his face was flushed with wine and seated among the crowd. Even the bow he always carried was tossed carelessly at his feet and was lying cold on the ground. For a moment, Li Xuanfeng said nothing.

The crowd wore faintly troubled looks, they were too afraid to speak, though a subtle air of schadenfreude passed among them. Li Yuanqin stood up, picked up his bow and staggered toward his father.

Li Xuanfeng cast a cold glance at him and grabbed his collar without a word. He hoisted him up and flew swiftly back to the estate on golden spirit wind. Only after the father and son had left did soft laughter ripple through the group left behind.

Someone spoke up, "Truly a tiger of a father, but a dog of a son!"

A Chi Family direct descendant beside him smiled and said, "You fool, Li Yuanqin is no simple character. He just doesn’t see eye to eye with his father, that’s all!"

A look of great satisfaction flashed in his eyes.

Li Xuanfeng flew through the air on the wind, carrying Li Yuanqin all the way back to the estate. Only then did he let go and set him down in the courtyard. Li Yuanqin said nothing, he straightened his robes and stood quietly to the side.

Li Xuanfeng stood in silence for a moment before speaking softly, "I don’t know how you ended up like this. When I return from the Northern Sea, I’ll take you traveling... Don’t mix with that crowd anymore."

Li Yuanqin nodded, stepped back and gave a respectful farewell before leaving on his own. Li Xuanfeng remained standing a few more seconds before rising on the wind and flew toward Daoist Master Yuan Su’s cave-dwelling.

He circled past the stone statue by the entrance. Inside the cave, white mist still drifted in ethereal coils. Before Li Xuanfeng even reached the inner chamber, he heard the soft tinkling of spring water. Bowing low, he entered to find Daoist Master Yuan Su seated upright on the jade platform as always.

Yuan Su still bore the appearance of a round-faced youth in his twenties, sitting calmly in the seat of honor. When he saw Li Xuanfeng approach, he finally stood and spoke in a gentle voice, "Come with me to the Northern Sea."
