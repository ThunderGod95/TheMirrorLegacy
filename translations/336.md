# Chapter 396: The Calamity of Mount Yu

The pig demon stumbled out of the Li Family territory hastily, wiping the wound on his face. He flew deep into Mount Dali without a word and only then did it dare to curse out loud, "Damn dog... What kind of lousy idea was that?! Making me take that sword for nothing! At least it was not face-to-face with Li Tongya... Lucky me...!"

He did not dare hold a grudge against the Li Family but was already seething with hatred for the hyena in the demon den who had come up with the idea. He cursed all the way back.

When he arrived at the demon den, a light gray hyena eagerly greeted him, its eyes darting around slyly as it squeaked, "Pig Two! What did the Li Family say?"

Pig Two was already looking for trouble with the hyena, and here it came to him. Although he had cowered before the Li Family, he had some status in the den. Now, his eyes bulged with rage as he yelled, "Damn dog! Filthy dog! Get out of my sight!"

With that, he kicked the hyena, which was only at the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, sending it rolling away with a yelp. Pig Two stormed into the cave, where a burly creature with a full beard sat.

The creature was devouring something, holding a chunk of flesh in his hand. Blood dripped from his brown-red beard, making it wet and sticky. His eyes were bloodshot as he glared at Pig Two and hissed, "What did Li Tongya say?"

Pig Two immediately wilted and stammered as he recounted the events. The demon general flew into a rage, cursing, "What nerve!"

His blood-red eyes flared, and his demonic qi surged as he yelled, "How dare they wave around the flag of the Devil Gate and act like some esteemed clan! When I ruled this mountain, that Li Tongya was just a garden boy! A mere small-time cultivator at the Embryonic Breathing Realm! If it were not for Si Yuanbai, the Li Family would not even exist! And now, I send a messenger, and Li Tongya does not dare to even meet him! This is too much! Argh... This is too much!"

The Foundation Establishment Realm pig demon roared furiously. The demon soldiers below, knowing his temper, huddled silently together until he had smashed the tables and chairs and left the ground covered in blood and debris. Only then did he calm down slightly.

The gray-furred hyena, who had recently joined the den and suggested testing the Li Family, thought himself clever. He sneaked forward and whispered, "Great king! The Li Family is arrogant, why not send..."

The burly creature, his face fierce, did not wait for him to finish. He backhanded the hyena, sending him flying and scattering teeth and blood everywhere as the hyena howled in pain loudly.

"Never mention the Li Family again!" the demon general roared, and the demon soldiers, feeling as if they were granted amnesty, understood that their great king was afraid and had decided to lay low.

They exchanged glances, relieved, "At least we do not have to face those immortal swords..."

The Li Family.

Spring winds once again swept over the land, turning the lake water back to a gentle light green. Perhaps it was the season, or the ample spiritual energy that nourished it, but the Li Family's Wanglin Blossom finally sprouted.

The tender green shoot appeared fragile and weak, but it was a Foundation Establishment Realm spirit root. The Li Family treated it like a treasure, watering it with spirit spring water consistently, engraving formations around it, and burying Spirit Stones in the soil, fearing that the spirit root might wither.

Fortunately, the old monkey tended to it meticulously, adjusting the soil composition and managing the spiritual energy in the earth veins. Though the spirit root seemed unspirited, it grew day by day, much to the relief of the Li Family.

Mount Lijing.

"The Spirit Paddies are growing well this year."

Li Xuanxuan walked along the mountain path with his hands clasped behind his back. Since the market's destruction, he had become idle as all the other roles in the family had been filled, and no one dared to order him around, leaving him with nothing to do.

Apart from his daily talisman drawing, Li Xuanxuan had no other engagements, so he wandered around and spent time with his grandson.

"It is funny... In the past, when there were few cultivators in the family, these Spirit Paddies were as hard as iron. Initially, mortals had to use axes enhanced with Golden Light spell to cut it..."

Li Yuanjiao, who was walking beside him, listened to his ramblings and nodded gently. Although Li Xuanxuan was his biological father, he had grown up under the care of his elder brother Li Yuanxiu, and had little to no direct contact with Li Xuanxuan.

Because of Li Yuanjiao's background, Li Xuanxuan was also not very close to him and harbored a silent guilt toward his son. Now, as he babbled on, Li Yuanjiao noticed a trace of nervousness in his father's demeanor, so he remained silent.

This life-and-death crisis had finally propelled Li Xuanxuan to break through to the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, but his progress was as slow as a turtle's. Now at fifty-nine years old, his cultivation speed would only decrease further after sixty, and he muttered quietly, "With my aptitude, it will take more than a decade to break through to the next heavenly layer after sixty. I might as well take the talisman pill now and break through to the fifth heavenly layer to avoid trouble after sixty..."

As he was thinking about this, a cheerful voice called out from behind them.

"Grandfather! Clan Uncle!"

Li Xuanxuan turned around to see two young boys, about twelve or thirteen, walking up the mountain path. The one in front, at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, had a radiant smile that made one feel like a spring breeze. He wore a brocade robe with a green jade bead tied to his wrist, swaying as he walked.

The other, taller and more handsome with a sword on his back, appeared more reserved. He smiled and greeted, "Xijun greets Granduncle and Clan Uncle."

"Good... good!"

Li Xuanxuan happily took the hands of the two juniors, warmly asking about their cultivation progress. Li Yuanjiao watched with a smile as they chatted and laughed, making their way to the small courtyard on the mountain.

Li Yuanping sat in his seat, silently reading the letters in his hand.

The Li Family had received two letters this month. One was from Chen Donghe to the west, stating that devil cultivators had also appeared in the territory of the Golden Feather Sect, with one dead and one injured among the two unrefined Qi Cultivators who accompanied him.

The Li Family currently had many unrefined Qi Cultivators from Mount Yue, so Li Yuanping decided to send two more loyal ones over. If not for the sensitive nature of the matter, he would have sent more.

The other letter was from Li Xizhi within the sect, stating that everything was going well. He hinted at the complex situation in the Cloud Crowned Peak market and advised against investigating too deeply to avoid trouble.

He also mentioned that members of the Fei Family had joined Yuanwu Peak two years ago. A female cultivator named Fei Qingyi, though not skilled in smithing, had good talent in cultivation and had gained the favor of Yu Muxian.

"Two years ago..." Li Yuanping sighed softly. The Fei Family had been quiet for the past seven or eight years, and their joining of the sect had been tightly covered up. If not for the letter from within the sect, there would have been no news on the lake, indicating their fear of interference from the Li Family.

"Ping'er!" Li Xuanxuan called out.

Seeing his aged face appear at the courtyard entrance with the two youths cupping their fist respectfully beside him, Li Yuanping quickly welcomed them in, handing the letter to Li Yuanjiao.

Li Yuanjiao read the letter and silently pondered to himself. Li Yuanping then said, "The Fei Family has been silent these years, rarely communicating with us. Their disciples only cultivate on the peak."

Li Yuanjiao nodded and replied, "How could our family obstruct the recruitment of disciples? If they were open about it, it would be fine... Sneaking around only shows their own guilt. Clearly, this is Fei Tongyu's doing, cautious and fearful like a busy white mouse preparing for winter."

He handed the letter back to Li Yuanping and said, "Do not worry about it!"

Li Yuanping nodded and put away the letter, smiling as he said, "Brother's description is quite apt."

Li Xuanxuan, on the other hand, was reading Chen Donghe's letter with a frown.

"It is troublesome for Donghe to handle this alone... Let me go and help him," he said finally.

Li Yuanping shook his head and replied, "That pass is large, but three people collecting qi is already the limit."

Speaking of qi collection, Li Yuanping had considered sending people into the mountains to gather the mountain's spiritual qi. It would take seven or eight years to collect one portion of Minor Pure Spiritual Qi.

Minor Pure Spiritual Qi required a vast mountainous area, and the Li Family, backed by the expanse of Mount Dali, could accommodate three or four people collecting qi simultaneously.

Moreover, Minor Pure Spiritual Qi was useful not only for advancing true Qi Cultivators but also in alchemy, smithing, and talisman drawing. Each portion was worth about thirty Spirit Stones. Unfortunately, though this qi was common, it was very troublesome to collect, requiring seven years of leaping through the mountains, delaying one's own cultivation.

"Once we have more unrefined Qi Cultivators, we can send them into the mountains, bringing in additional income each year..."

Li Yuanping was calculating the profit after deducting the salaries and subsidies for these cultivators when someone hurriedly approached them.

He respectfully reported, "Clan head! Madam Qingxiao has returned to visit her family... but..."

"Qingxiao?! Quickly, let her in!" Li Xuanxuan called out repeatedly, then stopped abruptly, seeing the hesitant expression on the clan soldier's face, and asked in confusion, "But what?"

The soldier dared not hide anything and answered, "Madam is dressed in mourning clothes..."

Everyone in the courtyard was startled as they heard this. Li Yuanping paused for a moment before exclaiming, "In... mourning clothes?!"

Li Yuanjiao also turned pale and quickly reacted, asking urgently, "Is it Xiao Xian? Or Xiao Jiuqing?"

The clan soldier rushed away, leaving everyone with grim faces. Li Xuanxuan clenched the armrest and said in a deep voice, "It must be the devil plague!"

After a while, Li Qingxiao indeed arrived in mourning clothes.

Now, her face was much thinner than when she left, her eyebrows lighter, and her lips were pale. She looked exhausted, with a faint scar on her wrist. She seemed like she had been through hard times.

Li Qingxiao had left as a charming young girl, but in less than ten years, she had returned as a frail woman. Her face was pale, her eyes slightly red, and as soon as she entered the courtyard, she fell to her knees with a thud.

"Please, my save my family, clan brothers!" she cried out desperately.

She looked ashen, tears streaming down her face like broken beads. Li Yuanping could not bear to see this, hurriedly stepping forward to help her up. However, Li Qingxiao remained kneeling stubbornly.

"What happened?!" Li Xuanxuan asked with a pained voice.

Li Qingxiao, her voice mournful as she wept, began explaining.

"My Mount Yu is located at the northernmost part of the Xiao Family territory, adjacent to the Purple Smoke Gate... We suffered heavy losses during that devil plague. My husband's clan uncles and clan brothers died in battle, and many were injured or lost cultivation path..."

"Later, when the devil cultivators moved north toward the Purple Smoke Gate, they passed through Mount Yu. My husband and father-in-law were cleaning up the aftermath when they encountered the devil cultivators..."

She wept bitterly, pressing her delicate fingers against the stone tiles, closing her eyes in pain as she wept, "When the clan members arrived, both my father-in-law and husband were dead... along with more than ten relatives, their bodies never found..."

"Dammit!"

The Li Family members all mourned silently, helping Li Qingxiao up and offering her comfort and tea, though she wa not in the mood to drink.

She cried anxiously, "The main line of Jiuqing on Mount Yu is now extinct, leaving only my two young sons... But according to the Xiao Family's branch rules, the position of head must be handed over to some clan brothers!"

With tears still streaming down her face, she continued, "But Xiao Xian always worried about the malicious intentions of these clan brothers... If I give up this position, how can I face my husband? What will become of my two children in the future?!"

Li Yuanping, upon hearing these words, had a vague premonition. His face turned slightly pale, and he took a step back, speaking gently, "Sister, do you mean to say...?"

Li Qingxiao kneeled again, her face as white as snow, her lips trembling, finding it difficult to speak. She said in a low voice, "I only hope... I only hope the family can send a few loyal people to accompany me to Mount Yu... as long as they have the strength to suppress the various branches of Mount Yu..."

"You..." Li Xuanxuan also fell silent, stumbling back, caught in a dilemma.

Li Qingxiao looked around at everyone's faces, then said sorrowfully, "Qingxiao understands the difficulties of the family. I have not troubled the family in these past years... but... but... I really cannot bear to see the position of Mount Yu fall into the hands of others!"

Li Yuanjiao's face darkened as he stared at Li Qingxiao. After a long silence, he finally said glumly, "This is a Xiao Family's matter! Sister... The Xiao Family is an immortal clan of the Purple Mansion Realm... how can our humble clan interfere?"

"Qingxiao understands!" Li Qingxiao kneeled, crying silently. Eventually, she said nothing more.

Li Yuanjiao's expression changed, and he asked, "Is Senior Yuansi in the clan?"

"He has already been ordered to go to the Eastern Sea!" she responded weakly.

How could Li Qingxiao not have thought of Xiao Yuansi? She had already sent someone to the clan to look for him.

Li Yuanjiao sighed deeply as he helped her up and wiped her tears, then said in a serious tone, "Do not be anxious... There will always be a way."

Once Li Qingxiao was seated properly, Li Yuanjiao waved his sleeve and instructed, "Invite Guiluan and Qinghong to come over."

When Xiao Guiluan and Li Qinghong arrived swiftly by riding the wind and heard the news, Li Qinghong gripped her spear tightly, her brow furrowed, unable to speak.

Xiao Guiluan, though not directly involved, was much clearer-headed. She considered the situation briefly and then said softly, "Madam, the main line of Mount Yu was severely damaged and should be recuperating. Why would they suddenly act so recklessly? Xiao Jiuqing is a smart person; he would never do such a thing. Was it an order from the family?"

Li Qingxiao shook her head and replied in a low voice, "It was not that my family acted recklessly, but... Mount Yu was already mostly ruined by the previous devil plague. Countless formations were breached, with only a few intact, making it easy for them to be slaughtered... My father-in-law had foresight and found an excuse to send the women and children to Xianyou Peak, allowing me to escape this disaster."

Xiao Guiluan nodded silently. The Xiao Family was currently recuperating, with the first formations to be repaired certainly being at Xianyou Peak and the main line. The formations of the branches at Mount Yu were numerous and complicated, so it was normal for them to be delayed.

She paused, her expression serious. She then asked in a deep voice, "Did the Xiao Family eventually eradicate these devil cultivators?"

Li Qingxiao, overwhelmed by sorrow, had not rushed here immediately. She had mde many arrangements and sought help from various sources, but all to no avail. Hence, she had no choice but to return home.

She immediately replied, "This group of devil cultivators came suddenly... They entered Mount Yu through the pass, killed people, and fled north without a trace. Although the family came to the rescue, it was already too late!"
