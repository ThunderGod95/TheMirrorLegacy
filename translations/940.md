# Chapter 940: Adoration

Jiangbei, Tangdao Mountain.

The rain and snow of early spring pattered down, drifting across the mountain's golden peaks before sliding from the eaves of a pavilion. A man in simple monk's robes sat within, one hand resting on a low table as he gazed out into the storm.

Before long, a youth emerged, walking untouched through the deluge.

The young man wore a tall, white gauze cap and a Daoist robe—white with gold trim, exquisitely embroidered with mystic-patterned black clouds. Two purple silk tassels hung from his waist. He had the handsome features of a youth, yet carried himself with an air of easy magnanimity. Arriving before the pavilion, he smiled brightly.

"Greetings, Abbot Fachang!"

The monk in the pavilion was none other than Maha Fachang, dispatched by the Great Adoration Dharma Realm to stand guard over Jiangbei.

When Fachang saw him, he immediately rose to greet him, a wide smile on his face.

"Greetings, Fellow Daoist Qi! Your Great Void movement technique is astonishingly fast. That was no short journey!"

He quickly gathered his inner robes, revealing white, tightly-bound trousers, and hurried down the steps to stand at the youth's side, gesturing him in. The youth, however, just smiled.

"It was just a simple movement art."

The young man entered, completed the requisite courtesies, and took a seat without fanfare. Maha Fachang, in contrast, seemed to defer to him, taking the adjacent seat to pour tea. He spoke with obvious pleasure:

"In the blink of an eye, several years have passed. How has Daoist Master Qi's cultivation on the mountain been?"

This Daoist Master clearly hailed from a significant background, for he accepted the monk's deferential attitude as perfectly natural. He replied,

"I've made some gains... But rather, congratulations are in order for your Great Adoration Dharma Realm. Your disciple-brother welcomed that honored status back to the mountain, secretly conforming to the Daoist Tradition. With his latest progress, I fear even I might soon be no match for him!"

At the mention of this, Maha Fachang's expression turned awkward. Though it was a joyous event, he found it difficult to speak of. He lowered his voice.

"His cultivation has indeed advanced... but in my view... it may not be a good thing. He is, after all, the Emperor of Wei. Bearing such karma is like a child swinging a sledgehammer. If one day he can't hold on and it slips from his grasp... he might very well be destroyed by it!"

The youth sneered, though a flicker of solemn agreement passed through his eyes. He clearly felt the same but knew the matter was too sensitive to discuss openly. He sighed, "There is a reason why a genius like you has stumbled and struggled in your cultivation... Some things cannot be spoken of lightly!"

Both knew not to dwell on the topic. The youth quickly changed the subject.

"I glanced over just now. I saw purple rain and falling feathers. Was there a soaring phenomenon in the south?"

Maha Fachang quickly replied:

"Indeed. But strangely, there was no malignant energy. It wasn't the Bound Earth Moving Technique, nor was it the Capital Guard's mountain god soaring method... My subordinates report... the mountain was Mount Xianyou, Xiao Chuting's clan."

"I know!"

The youth lifted his leg, and the mystic-patterned black clouds on his robe seemed to shimmer with spiritual light. He looked intrigued.

"He went to the Northern Sea, borrowing the power of Pit Water. Daoist Master Ji'an couldn't remain either and gave him Mount Pai'er. But Mount Pai'er is too small. It's fine for immortal seclusion, but not for raising a clan. He needed another mountain!"

Hearing this, Maha Fachang frowned in confusion.

"Jiangnan is an immense distance from the Northern Sea! It would likely take a Great Daoist Master from the Bound Earth Daoist Tradition to move a mountain that far. Xiao Chuting was right not to use Bound Earth; he would have had to use the Capital Guard's soaring technique."

"But that's what I don't understand... He cultivates Pit Water..."

Before he could finish, the youth waved his hand, took a sip of tea, and smiled.

"Bai Ziyu came to the Profound Governance Pavilion. I've met him. He also cultivates the Capital Guard... That Capital immortals Dao territory right next to yours belongs to him. I made a point to ask..."

"This Xiao Chuting has a junior named Xiao Yongling. He cultivates the 'Eastern Feather Mountain' aspect of the Capital Guard dao—it's the conceptual soaring mountain of the Dao-art. The Xiao family poured all their resources into helping him break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. This was all part of the plan."

"Mount Xianyou is a major mountain, after all. Even a single one of its peaks is a considerable mountain in Jiangnan. And it was so far away... He first borrowed a Spiritual Artifact, but it still wasn't enough. He needed another boost. I saw he had formations prepared on the mountain long ago, just waiting for this opportune moment!"

Maha Fachang needed to hear no more. His earlier suspicions were confirmed, and he nodded.

"I understand... If this Xiao Yongling succeeds, the 'Eastern Feather Mountain' soaring phenomenon from his advancement to the Purple Mansion Realm and the refinement of his divine ability would combine, helping to lift the peak... And if he failed, the phenomenon of his failure, of his body returning to the world, could also have been used."

"Exactly. That was his scheme."

The youthful Daoist Master Qi laughed heartily.

"A brilliant move! I saw he was prepared long ago, but I never expected that Xiao Yongling to have such a deep foundation. He fought one battle after another and, against all odds, actually managed to hang on... According to Xiao Chuting's original plan, he probably should have initiated the event during the great battle!"

"In the end, it dragged on until now, and he got drawn in a bit deeper than he wanted. But at last, the dust has settled, and his plan has succeeded."

Maha Fachang shook his head.

"It's only natural he planned this far ahead. Xiao Chuting was a late bloomer. Even though he had fortuitous encounters and secret arts, allowing his divine ability to progress rapidly, how much of his lifespan can possibly be left? The Xiao family has no other outstanding heirs, and even if they did, it's no longer convenient for them to remain in Jiangnan."

Daoist Master Qi chuckled, steering the conversation away. "But this Daoist Master Yehui, Bai Ziyu... he's truly a fascinating man. He has a brilliant and magnanimous mind. My lord spoke with him for a while and came away deeply impressed! It's incredible. First, there was Changxiao, and now him. To think that rogue cultivators can consistently produce talent like this..."

He turned his head, his smile fading slightly.

"How is Jiangbei?"

Maha Fachang pressed his palms together. His simple, unadorned robes stood in stark contrast to the Daoist Master's opulent attire. His eyes held a trace of helplessness as he spoke in a low voice.

"It has been pacified. There are no major conflicts. However, that White Qilin by the river... I have yet to see it. The aura of the Undefeated King of Brightness is still potent in the area. Logically... the Undefeated King of Brightness only attained his wondrous state by being a direct blood descendant of the Emperor of Wei who joined the Buddhists. He should be inferior to the Qilin."

Daoist Master Qi's expression was neutral.

"The Undefeated King of Brightness..."

His tone held a trace of disdain, but it was, after all, a revered ancestor from the monk's own Daoist Tradition. He couldn't say more. He simply bowed his head to sip his tea, offering no further comment.

Maha Fachang did not fail to notice. He, too, silently lowered his gaze and changed the subject.

"It's just... the Yan Kingdom is still applying pressure, demanding we make a move... They've sent people over."

Daoist Master Qi shook his head with a small smile.

"It's Murong Yan and Shilou Yingge."

This news seemed to differ from what the monk had heard. His eyes widened slightly.

"The Valiant King just left, so why is another member of the Gao family here? And that Helian Wujiang is, frankly, just the Tiefu King. Now two royal families are present... What's next? Are they going to call King Chen and King Dai over as well?"

"It's good news, not a mediation... The Gao family has produced a genius, Gao Fangjing. He has already reached the Purple Mansion Realm, so they have the strength to spare someone else to come down."

The monk could only nod at this, though his expression remained joyless. Daoist Master Qi seemed to understand his apprehension and smiled.

"In all these years... it's not as if people haven't crossed the river between north and south. What is there to fear? Cultivators from the south have been crossing the river for years, and no one ever seemed afraid."

"Or is it that only the southern Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is permitted to cross the river, while the various Daos of the north are forbidden from going south? The key isn't who crosses, monk. You're looking at it all wrong!"

He leaned to the side, a grin playing on his lips.

"If they truly didn't want the north to cross, things never would have developed to this point. As long as no one goes too far, a duel of techniques, or even a few large-scale battles, is perfectly fine."

But despite his words, it was clear the northern powers were all nervous. Maha Fachang's expression flickered with a low melancholy. He seemed to be listening intently, yet also seemed as if he were merely waiting for a required promise.

He intoned, "This humble monk understands... Thank you, Fellow Daoist, for coming down from the north to dispel my confusion... Otherwise, with my dull aptitude, who knows how many days it would have taken me to comprehend."

"Dull?"

Daoist Master Qi looked amused.

"I think you're just afraid of creating killing-karma... Sometimes I have to wonder, are Beigu and Yeren the ones from the Liao River... or are you?"

Maha Fachang bowed his head slightly.

"I would not dare compare myself to the high cultivators of the Northern Revered One Dao. But when I accepted this duty, I knew this journey would require me to create immeasurable killing-karma!"

He hailed from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, which was one of the most reputable sects among the northern Buddhists. They believed that this present world was the Buddhist Land, and one need not seek it in a life to come. Whether they were cultivators or believers, they all actively participated in reforming the mortal world, striving to make it resemble the pure lands described in the scriptures.

It was precisely because of this Dao that the Great Adoration Dharma Realm was the subject of much criticism among its peers. Many believed they blasphemed the sacred classics. Holding this position, Maha Fachang naturally endured immense pressure.

But if it were not for this, why would Qi Lanyan of the Viewing Pavilion faction be willing to call him 'Fellow Daoist'? The young man now smiled.

"Monk, since you knew you would create killing-karma, why walk this path? Why needlessly give yourself a mental obstacle?"

Maha Fachang let out a long, quiet sigh.

"This region... it must have a Buddhist cultivator presiding over it. If it were any of the other sects, who knows how cruel their methods would be! They would simply use their heretical arts, absorb all these common people into their Belly Buddhist Land, and refine them into their divine abilities... Only by coming myself can I ensure this place has some measure of peace."

"If I did not come... that is when I would truly have cause for regret."

...

"Mount Xianyou has left Jiangnan."

Amid hurried voices, several cultivators landed on the mountain peak. Li Jiangqian led two people all the way to the summit before entering the main hall alone. He bowed.

"Father... someone from the Xiao family is here."

The man seated above opened his eyes.

It had only been a few hours since Mount Xianyou had soared away, but the entire lake region was in an uproar. It was no small mountain, and its departure had been spectacular. No one knew where it had landed, only that it was certainly outside of Jiangnan, which inevitably sparked all manner of speculation.

Li Zhouwei had known from the moment he heard the news that the Xiao family would send someone. He said simply, "Let them come up."

After a short wait, a man entered the hall. He was tall and thin, with a rather dashing appearance. The Xiao family had kept their mountain sealed for many years, remaining aloof and safe from the various storms. As such, their direct descendants were no longer widely recognized. The man bowed politely in the hall.

"Junior Xiao Congyu pays his respects to Daoist Master Minghuang!"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"There is no need for such courtesy."

Xiao Congyu straightened up and spoke respectfully.

"The matter of the mountain's soaring was of utmost importance, which is why the Daoist Master never revealed it... Even the many clan brothers and elders on the mountain were unaware. Only the Daoist Master and the Family Head knew... Now that the mountain has been uprooted, the Daoist Master is occupied with many tasks. I have come this time to bid farewell."

"My Xiao family has already relocated to Cangzhou in the Northern Sea..."

The celestial phenomenon had not yet faded from the sky, but the man was already at his door. He had clearly set out at the first possible moment. Li Zhouwei looked at the man kneeling in the hall, a trace of pity in his heart.

Xiao Chuting was a man who prioritized self-preservation. In his early years, the spiritual energies of Jiangnan had required his intervention, forcing him to stay. Later, once he found breathing room between the two major sects, he immediately sealed his mountain, gradually abandoning his surrounding interests. His plot to escape Jiangnan was clearly not a plan of one or two years.

This outcome wasn't surprising; if anything, it was overdue. Li Zhouwei simply said:

"Our two families have been on good terms for many years. My great-uncle, in particular, admires the Daoist Master greatly. He has often spoken of his wish to pay his respects, and has mentioned it to me several times, but the Daoist Master's movements were always uncertain, and a meeting never materialized."

Li Zhouwei never wanted to drag others into his own affairs. He only hoped that these allies of the Li family might, in the future, offer some protection to his kin. Thus, his words were focused entirely on Li Ximing.

"When my great-uncle travels to Cangzhou in the Northern Sea to pay his respects... I hope the Daoist Master will be able to see him."

Xiao Congyu immediately kowtowed, his voice filled with respect.

"My Daoist Master mentioned this... He is also deeply concerned for Daoist Master Zhaojing. From this day forward, our sect will be located at Mount Pai'er, in Pit North Prefecture, Cangzhou, Northern Sea. If the Daoist Master has any request, he may visit at any time."

Li Zhouwei nodded and gestured with his hand.

"I must remain here to guard the lake. It will most likely be Daoist Master Zhaojing who visits. The Immortal Clan has moved to a new home; he will certainly go to offer his congratulations and a gift."

The Xiao family member said no more. Seeing Li Zhouwei's dismissive gesture, he quickly took his leave. Li Jiangqian, who had escorted the man out, returned and said in a low voice:

"Father... The Xiao clan was in seclusion for many years and made their preparations long ago. They formed no new marriage alliances... They took all the direct relatives and blood kin they could, and all who could leave, left..."

He lowered his gaze.

"In your son's view, the Xiao family's departure has no real impact on the larger situation... That Daoist Master was never going to involve himself with any faction. Even if he had stayed, when the north caused trouble... he would not have been implicated or offended."

The man in the crimson robe narrowed his eyes slightly.

"He chose to leave now, while there is still a measure of gratitude for the help he just rendered... It was the perfect time."

Li Zhouwei gestured that he understood. "He could only leave," he said softly, "precisely because his departure has no impact on the larger situation."

The golden-eyed man rose from the main seat, descended the steps, and paced to the front of the hall. His expression was serene. In the dimming light of the sky, his golden eyes seemed exceptionally bright.

From this vantage point, he could just see the roiling mists of power across the river. Plumes of brilliant radiance mixed with clouds of multicolored light were rising from the north. Dense swarms of human figures emerged from within those clouds.

Those golden pupils reflected the scene in the sky. Neither the clouds nor the spiritual mists could obstruct his vision, which pierced the veil to reveal every black shadow and golden body moving within.

"Put that aside... Inform the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Someone is crossing the river."
