# Chapter 1093: Grand Divination

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing... what was his reply?"

Heavy snow fell on the shore. In the Great Void, a figure of multicolored light stood. The Daoist Master's face was like jade, a vermilion dot on his brow. He held a small, crimson cauldron, his bearing extraordinary, yet his face was clouded with worry.

At Cheng Qian's question, the dejected Sima Yuanli was at a loss for words. He could only say,

"This time... I couldn't even see him. A junior of his came to turn me away, claiming he's in closed-door cultivation refining pills and at a critical juncture. He can't be disturbed."

Cheng Qian's expression changed. He shook his head.

"How can he play so hard!"

Li Ximing's excuse was laughably false, a complete slap in the face to the Yang family. Sima Yuanli's expression was bitter.

"What else can be done? Logically, even if his injuries haven't healed, he should have at least come out to meet us, even if wounded. For him to be this unyielding..."

"How will the Great General handle this?"

Although Cheng Qian hadn't interacted much with Li Ximing, he seemed to have a favorable impression of the Li family and didn't want to see major casualties. A shadow crossed his features.

He watched as Sima Yuanli gritted his teeth.

"The Great General said... to pay him no mind."

'Li Zhouwei is the high and mighty King Wei,' Sima Yuanli thought, 'He doesn't even have to set foot in the Great Song court. I won't say how much higher his status is than Yang Ruiyi's, but they're peers at minimum. Li Ximing is, strictly speaking, King Wei's subordinate. For the moment, Yang Ruiyi truly can't touch him...'

But the meaning was clear. If the Li family wouldn't contribute to the border defense, the Yang family wouldn't send men to guard the lake. They were telling Li Ximing to guard it himself.

This was a scenario Sima Yuanli had desperately wanted to avoid.

Everyone knew that with Situ Huo entering Song, Ning Wan was in a difficult position. But the truth was, he, Sima Yuanli... was in no better a situation!

'Of the old Azure Pond Three Yuans, only Yuanwu was on good terms with the Situ family. The others couldn't stand the sight of them! Yuansu and Situ Huo were practically mortal enemies. My own master was only slightly better—he merely refrained from taking revenge before he died!'

Sima Yuanli was, in his heart, deeply opposed to Situ Huo's presence in Song. The man before him, Cheng Qian, might be polite, but Sima Yuanli knew full well that his master, Daoist Master Xianyao, was the one who had spent years building bridges for Situ Huo. When the Kong Clan and the Situ family had their falling out, it was Xianyao who had profited the most!

'And now Xianyao plays the peacemaker, but he's clearly on Situ Huo's side!'

In the entire court, only Liu Bai could truly challenge Situ Huo. But as fate would have it, Ning Wan had plotted against Liu Bai, forcibly dragging him onto the Great Song's war chariot. While that Jade True sword cultivator didn't seem to hold a grudge, he had clearly adopted an attitude of cutting off all ties...

Faced with Situ Huo, Sima Yuanli had no choice but to help Ning Wan. This had immediately shattered the Great Song's internal unity. The faction led by Situ Huo held immense power and influence. It was a complete mess.

'The Holder of the Profound has its count. Although that time hasn't come, that day will... If Li Ximing and Yang Ruiyi have a falling out... I won't even be able to borrow King Wei's influence...'

His worried gaze fell on Cheng Qian, making the Daoist Master frown slightly. Sima Yuanli noticed and looked up, probing,

"I was wondering... Cheng Qian... do you have any solution..."

"Me?" Cheng Qian let out a laugh. "Daoist Friend Qinghu, you must be truly desperate to be grasping at any straw, but surely not to the point of coming to me."

The youth showed no sign of worry.

"However... I don't think there's any need for such anxiety. For now, Lord Yang is guarding the west, Protector-General Liu is leading the Holders of Profound to assault the Capital immortals territory, and we are to support Senior Tinglan. We just need to follow orders."

Sima Yuanli, however, knew just how risky Yang Ruiyi's operation was. He cursed internally.

'You cultivate the "Whole Pill," so of course you're not afraid! That half-immortal, half-demon, half-shaman Dao lineage is bizarre to its very core. The moment you sense trouble, you'll run faster than anyone!'

But cursing was all he could do. A moment later, Sima Yuanli was struck by an even deeper unease.

'Lord Yang is being ruthless this time. I wonder what he promised Chen Yin to make him lead the charge. That old man is already fighting like he has a death wish. I dread to think what his end will be.'

He, Sima Yuanli, could understand Chen Yin's state of mind, and it put him on high alert.

'Though I am at my peak and have no immediate worries, and I have an outstanding descendant in Xun... the world is unpredictable. I must use this unprecedented 500-year shift in True Qi to send him to the Purple Mansion Realm as soon as possible.'

...

Mount Dali.

The mountain ranges rose and fell, blanketed in flying snow. A streak of Heavenly Light descended gracefully, landing lightly amidst the forest.

Li Zhouwei touched down among the peaks and noticed small demons bustling about. The once-empty cave residences were gradually filling with life, and the number of demon beasts had clearly increased.

'Mount Dali... it's become much more prosperous!'

Thanks to the shifting power dynamics in Jiangnan and the decline of the Azure Pond Sect, fewer cultivators now ventured into Mount Dali, allowing the demon beasts to be spared. Furthermore, the Li family's unification of Moongaze Lake had transformed the relationship between the rogue cultivators and clan cultivators of Ting Province and Mount Dali. What was once a hunting ground had slowly become a place of trade, breathing new life into the entire mountain range.

The moment Li Zhouwei landed, demon beasts from several nearby peaks took to the air to see. Upon recognizing him, their faces paled in alarm, and they all cried out, "Great King!"

A middle-aged man stumbled through the air toward him.

"Lu Ken greets the Great King!"

This deer demon had been one of Bai Rong the fox's attendants back in the day. Now, he had managed to become a minor king himself, but he was still flustered at the sight of Li Zhouwei. He led him inside, and once again, they arrived at the great pool on the main peak's summit.

White mist billowed and clouds of qi swirled. From within, a beautiful man emerged. He was tall and slender, his features soft, handsome, and bewitching. He stopped before the steps and offered his congratulations.

"Congratulations, Great King!"

It was none other than the Tingfu Demon King, Qingyu Qian!

Li Suining, who had accompanied him, had long since calmed his heart. Now, he gazed at his surroundings, marveling.

'So this is... a treasured land of the fox-kind!'

The Demon King was, after all, a fox. He was exquisitely beautiful, his bright eyes fixed on Li Suining with a peculiar expression. Li Zhouwei returned the courtesy,

"The joy is mutual."

Qingyu Qian was congratulating Li Zhouwei on reaching the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. In turn, Li Zhouwei's golden eyes swept over him, seeing just as clearly. The Demon King made no effort to hide it—he had impressively already stepped past the threshold of Purple Mystery.

Demon beasts had long lifespans but cultivated slowly. This was, without a doubt, a massive breakthrough, one that might have taken him one or even two hundred years to achieve. It should have been an occasion for great celebration, yet the Demon King before him showed little joy. As he invited Li Zhouwei inside, he replied,

"I have no joy to speak of. The Dao path of this life has reached its end."

He waved his sleeve, clearing the white fog, and invited Li Zhouwei to sit. Li Suining naturally stood respectfully to the side. Only then did Li Zhouwei allow a trace of doubt to show.

"Is it because the 'Heaven-Governing' Dao lineage is incomplete?"

Qingyu Qian let out a self-deprecating laugh and shook his head.

"I've always been dull-witted, simply not the material for Dao cultivation. And now, the 'Heaven-Governing' path has its spiritual inspiration imprisoned and its Rank Designation obscured by exile. It's impossible to achieve anything astonishing. All that's left for me is to waste away my remaining days."

He spoke to Li Zhouwei, but his gaze remained fixed on Li Suining, a warm smile playing on his lips. He poured a clear wine, setting out three jade cups and filling each. He then made an inviting gesture toward Li Suining as well.

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. Li Suining respectfully accepted the cup with thanks. He had no idea what kind of immortal brew it was. He cautiously lifted it to sniff, preparing to just barely touch it with his upper lip.

Who could have known? The instant he inhaled, the immortal brew acted like a living thing. It transformed into a stream of cool qi that shot up his nasal cavity and straight into his Shengyang Acupoint. His face flushed crimson. He staggered back a step and, with a thud, collapsed to the ground, unconscious.

Only then did Li Zhouwei set down his own cup.

"Well?"

Qingyu Qian simply smiled.

"Favored by the Book of Elements... his nobility is beyond words!"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow.

"Book of Elements?"

The fox demon stood, his expression turning reverent.

"The Heaven-Governing Rank Designation—the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book!"

This demon was truly a great fox demon. The smile vanished from his face, and his handsome, charming features instantly became cold and severe, revealing an air of unspeakable dignity.

"The Orthodox Origin Yin-Yang, the Three Profound Great Daoist tradition. The Azure Profoundity is lofty and solitary, ethereal and detached from the world. The Comprehending Profoundity flourishes, its palaces filled with disciples, always dabbling in worldly affairs. But Encompassing Profoundity... it had three Monarchs and five immortals. Its immortal might was vast and boundless."

"Heaven-Governing originated in Encompassing Profoundity. Before the masters of the Three Profoundities spread their teachings to the world, they first accepted disciples. The master of Encompassing Profoundity had a disciple, surname Chunyu, name Zhao. He 'verified' the Dao of 'Heaven-Governing' and was titled Qingyi, noble enough to be an Immortal Lord."

He paused slightly.

"That Immortal Lord Huan Xuan, the one who established the Northern Palace Divine Thunder, was his disciple-brother. He only verified his Dao and left later because he was guarding the Dao lineage. That, and the fact that the Thunder Palace is more famous, is why he is so well-known. As for that Master Canyan, the patriarch revered by the Seven Aspects? He was merely one of Immortal Lord Qingyi's in-name disciples."

He seemed both resigned and helpless as he was forced to add,

"The Buddhist cultivators call him The Buddhists' Celestial Participant of the Dams. If you really want to compare, his achievements were no less than an Immortal Lord's... And he had a disciple who was even more famous: Celestial Enlightenment Su Xikong, the foundational pillar of the modern Buddhist Dao."

He closed his mouth, saying no more. Li Zhouwei was somewhat shaken.

"I knew Encompassing Profoundity was formidable, but I never imagined... formidable to this extent!"

"It was more than just formidable!" Qingyu Qian shook his head and sighed. "In its glory days, Encompassing Profoundity's might shook the eight directions and looked down upon the nine provinces. Even the invincible Chunhuo Great Sage—that Yuwu bird—had to send his second son over to seek the Dao. You need only look at the power of Merging Fire and Converging Water today to know how rampant that Great Sage was back then."

Li Zhouwei nodded, then asked,

"If that's the case, shouldn't 'Heaven-Governing,' being even more powerful, have governed over all things?"

Qingyu Qian paused, stunned, then shook his head.

"It's not like that. There is attaining the Dao, verifying the Dao, and seeking the Dao. In ancient times, these terms were clearly distinct. A Great Sage is born and nurtured by heaven and earth, a symbol of a Fruition Attainment. When one flourishes, all flourish; when one is harmed, all are harmed. This is different from an Immortal Lord, whose karma resides freely within himself. The ancient Immortal Lords respected heaven and earth and did not wish to use their personal actions to influence the rise and fall of Fruition Attainments—they disliked it and would not do it. A Great Sage, however, cannot help but have an influence."

Li Zhouwei's own Dao-Profundity was not shallow; he understood at once and nodded.

Qingyu Qian continued,

"This thing, a Rank Designation, can be seen as a special kind of Dharma Treasure. It typically manifests with a True Monarch and dissipates when the True Monarch perishes. It was the Great Dao of True Immortals first comprehended by Encompassing Profoundity. What Immortal Lord Qingyi held was not actually the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book. It was the My Dao's Heaven-Governing Celestial Gate."

"Immortal Lord Qingyi's cultivation reached its zenith. Unable to advance, he prepared to shed his body to seek the Dao. But he worried for his Dao lineage. He was granted an audience with the master of the Three Profound Daos and obtained a method to separate his Rank Designation. Fearing that the My Dao's Heaven-Governing Celestial Gate was too powerful to be left without a master's control, lest it harm the world, he created the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book. For a very long time, as 'Heaven-Governing' faded in and out of existence, this artifact was suppressed among the Dharma Treasures of the Encompassing Profoundity Immortal Court, used to calculate the affairs of the world..."

"Later, when the Thunder Palace cast its lightning, it relied on this artifact to calculate karma, ensuring the descending thunder had its count."

Qingyu Qian looked melancholic as he shook his head.

"And this artifact... was finally suppressed within Wanling Heaven!"

The golden-eyed youth before him nodded slightly, having already guessed the gist of it. A doubt rose in his heart.

'The timing doesn't add up... could it have been a possession partway through?'

As if on cue, Qingyu Qian gave a cold laugh.

"I heard that all the immortals gathered at that time, working together to transfer the artifact completely to the Underworld to prevent it from throwing the world into chaos. But several strands of fated opportunity escaped and fell upon the world. This junior of yours... just happened to obtain one of them!"

He appeared relaxed, but his eyes were locked onto the golden-eyed youth's changing expression. Li Zhouwei, having pondered this for a long time, replied,

"Senior is truly learned, versed in all matters ancient and modern."

"The Thunder Palace fell, the Great Zhou rose, and only after the Zhou came the Wei. Your human-recorded history only goes back to the Great Wei. Naturally, you are not sensitive to these matters."

He chuckled, but saw Li Zhouwei ask,

"I wonder, what kind of fated opportunity?"

Qingyu Qian mused for a moment.

"To know the future before it is divined; to perceive before all others!"

Li Zhouwei's expression tightened.

'So that's how it is!'

He was silent for a long time, his mind racing.

'That silver light... could it have been the Immortal Mirror sending a warning about the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book? If it's a supreme treasure of that origin, the legacy of a mighty Immortal Lord, it's not unthinkable that it would attract the attention of an Immortal Artifact... Is it possible that Chi Buzi also received one of these opportunities?'

He had come here to probe for answers and had received one that seemed to explain everything perfectly, with no loose ends.

Li Zhouwei pondered a moment longer, then followed this line of thought.

"If that's the case... does Senior know who else in the world might have received such an opportunity?"

Qingyu Qian burst out laughing.

"I never take a single step from this mountain, so I shouldn't know the talents of the world. But it just so happens that one such person did come here once. He threw the entirety of Jiangnan into chaos and had all the Purple Mansion Realm experts jumping in frustration!"

Li Zhouwei's eyebrows shot up, a look of dawning realization on his face.

The Demon King smiled.

"Precisely! Your family's good friend—surnamed Liu, named Changdie! He once had such an opportunity, a chance favor from the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book. He was just like these people are now!"

Li Zhouwei shot to his feet, a sudden, stunning realization hitting him.

'So that's it! It all makes sense! This Senior Liu helped my family so many times for no apparent reason, building a connection... this must be why!'

But he held his tongue, for another, even more profound realization was dawning in his heart.

'Wait. If every word he's said is true, then the illusory, multicolored light seen in the Immortal Mirror's vision cannot be the favor of the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book—otherwise, my own ancestor would have noticed it!'

Even if his ancestor hadn't carefully inspected Liu Changdie, Liu Changdie had been on the very same island as Fuxun. Since Li Ximing detected Fuxun back then, it's impossible he would have missed Liu Changdie!

'There must be a celestial gambit at play on Suining. This so-called favor from the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book is just a superficial misdirection to hide the truth!'

He raised his head, his gaze sharp, meeting Qingyu Qian's stare. The Demon King gazed at him for a long time, as if he, too, was trying to make a judgment.

"He... should be King Wei's fated opportunity," Qingyu Qian said softly.
