# Chapter 484: The Madam

Snow fell heavily. The sound of the words my dear rang sweetly in the air, catching Li Xuanfeng's attention as his gaze lingered on the soft, graceful figure before him. He responded politely, "Hemian, is the Daoist Master looking for me?"
𝗳𝚛𝚎𝚎𝘄𝕖𝕓𝕟𝕠𝚟𝚎𝕝.𝗰𝕠𝐦

Ning Hemian gave a brief nod then shook her head, saying, "Someone from the grotto heaven has arrived. The Daoist Master has already returned to Azure Pond Peak to pay his respects."

Ning Hemian had been married to him for five or six years now. Initially, Li Xuanfeng had reluctantly agreed to the marriage, but in the blink of an eye, those years had passed. They had always treated each other with mutual respect. Ning Hemian's mind was mostly on her cultivation, so their relationship was pretty harmonious.

Li Xuanfeng slung his bow over his shoulder and walked alongside her. Ning Hemian was always courteous toward him. After all, they had shared the same bed for several years. To say there were no feelings at all would be untrue, yet there was always something unresolved between them.

Li Xuanfeng harbored deep resentment toward the Azure Pond Sect. The deaths of many of his close relatives were tied to the sect. His wife and child had also perished in a deal between the Azure Pond Sect and Golden Tang Gate.

Originally, after seeing Chi Wei's death, Li Xuanfeng had thought that the Azure Pond Sect was in trouble, with an outsider Purple Mansion Realm cultivator proving too powerful for them to handle. He had secretly encouraged himself, sensing an opportunity, as Yuan Su seemed disdainful of the Chi Family and eager to act. His mind was filled with calculations.

However, a few months ago, Yuan Su had summoned him. He was informed that the Daoist Master would be leaving Yi Mountain City to pay respects to another Daoist Master named Suiguan, sent by the Azure Pond Grotto Heaven.

Another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Azure Pond Grotto Heaven... What is this?

The news that the grotto heaven had sent someone to the sect—a late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, no less—left him feeling dejected. This meant that there were likely more of them in the grotto heaven. For ten consecutive days, he vented his frustrations on demons atop the city walls, pacing through the snow in silence.

His mind raced with countless thoughts as snow continued to fall from the sky. Beside him, Ning Hemian followed quietly. After a moment's pause, Li Xuanfeng decided to ask, "Hemian, do you know the origin of this grotto heaven?"

Ning Hemian nodded and, with polite formality, replied, "My family knows a bit about it. I can tell you about it but you mustn't spread it out, my dear."

Seeing Li Xuanfeng nod in agreement, Ning Hemian softly went on to explain, "My father once accompanied the Daoist Master inside. Outsiders call it Azure Pond Grotto Heaven, but that is not quite accurate... Its true name is Pristine Cadence Heaven. Very few people have entered, and there are hardly any people inside."

She hesitated slightly, as if pondering something, then continued, "The True Monarch who created the grotto heaven had strange intentions back then. There is no sky, no land, no sun, and no moon inside—only endless turquoise waters. To be honest... it is not truly the property of the Azure Pond Sect."

"Oh?" Li Xuanfeng was taken aback by this and asked, "Then whose treasure is it?"

Ning Hemian smiled reluctantly and lowered her voice, "Whose..? Perhaps some True Monarch's. In this world, Golden Core Realm cultivators are already immortal. Maybe he is hidden somewhere within the grotto heaven, or perhaps he has left to seclude himself in the heavens beyond. In any case, the Azure Pond Sect cannot fully control Pristine Cadence Heaven..."

Ning Hemian continued, "Moreover, it is impossible to stay long inside Pristine Cadence Heaven. It is not just mortals—even Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who stay for a few days will dissolve into blood. Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who stay for a year or two will lose their minds, their divine abilities will be exhausted, and they will turn into mortals."

Ning Hemian's expression grew more worried, her voice softening further as she continued, "Occasionally, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the sect makes a trip there on order. My father once entered due to his unique cultivation method... but there was no one inside. Yet, someone suddenly stepped out of such a grotto heaven, wearing fresh clothes, claiming to be Daoist Master Suiguan, bearing the surname Chi."

Li Xuanfeng pondered this deeply, feeling a chill down his spine. Ning Hemian whispered, "My cousin also saw this Daoist Master Suiguan. He could not tell which lineage or family he belonged to, nor did he mention any ancestral ties. He said his surname was Chi, and Chi Zhiyun would not dare question him."

Li Xuanfeng stared at her, dumbfounded, "Are you saying..."

Her smile seemed hollow as she spoke, "Every move the Azure Pond Sect makes comes from orders within the grotto heaven. I used to think they could not come out, but now it seems they simply did not want to."

Ning Hemian's voice dropped as she added somberly, "Perhaps the grotto heaven is not the property of the Azure Pond Sect. Maybe... the Azure Pond Sect is the property of the grotto heaven."

Li Xuanfeng opened his mouth, but before he could respond, Ning Hemian pulled him into the house. She shut the door tightly, and the barrier formation activated automatically. As she helped him out of his robe, she whispered softly, "I am telling you all this in secret because, truthfully, I have my own selfish reasons..."

Ning Hemian paused briefly and continued, "My dear, I have come to sense certain things after sharing a bed with you for so long... The Azure Pond Sect is a colossal force that brings despair, clinging to the void itself... Please, let go of your hatred..."

Li Xuanfeng sat down on the couch as Ning Hemian nestled into his arms, undoing her clothes as her eyes brimmed with tears.

"I know you hate it... My Ning Family did not have it easy in earlier years either. If it were not for a Daoist Master's achievements, I don't know how miserable things would have been for us now."

"Does the Yang Family not hate the Azure Pond Sect? What about the Deng Family? Or the Yu Family? Azure Pond once had only sixteen peaks... Now, it has thirty-six. The younger generation of these families take great pride in identifying with Azure Pond."

Ning Hemian observed his expression, trying to guess his thoughts, and continued, "The Deng Family endured such hardship, yet only a few direct descendants hold resentment. Does Chi Zhiyun not know this? He simply does not care... Among the Deng Family, who does not identify themselves with Azure Pond? Who truly represents the Deng Family?"

Li Xuanfeng clenched his teeth as he held her, watching as her delicate face flushed with a shade of pink. Ning Hemian's eyes were filled with affection as she looked at him, speaking softly, "Do you think that Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er's children will hate Azure Pond for some long-past grievance involving Li Chejing from generations ago? I may not know how you managed to deceive your family's ancestor, but I doubt everyone in the Li Family possesses such abilities..."

Ning Hemian continued, "Today, the Yang and Yu families could be the target, and tomorrow the Li Family. Otherwise, it could be the Qi or Deng families. This scheme of Azure Pond can break down family bonds, turn enemies into allies, or assimilate them into the sect..."

Li Xuanfeng's palm was so hot that it left a red mark on her pale arm. Ning Hemian gazed at him lovingly, but the man's sharp eyes burned with intensity as he stared at her.

"Those within the sect are not necessarily friends, and those outside it are not necessarily enemies," he said.

Ning Hemian chuckled softly, resting her head against his chest as she whispered, "My Ning Family is a friend of your esteemed clan. As for who the enemy is... you and I both know that well."

Li Xuanfeng let her nestle in his arms for a long time, his passion already stirred. Finally, he lifted her with a growl, grumbling, "Stop talking about 'my Ning Family'... You are already married to me—now we are one. No more talk of two separate families!"

"Mm!" Ning Hemian responded gently. For the first time, the distance between their hearts vanished. She lifted her head and smiled affectionately.

Qingdu Peak was once covered in white irises, but now, in the depths of winter, heavy snow had fallen, blanketing the entire peak in white. As the snow ceased, the sun shone brightly in the clear sky.

Xiao Guiluan was in her quiet chamber cultivating, her elegant phoenix eyes giving her a charming look. She wore a simple black dress.

Xiao Guiluan had reached the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. She possessed considerable talent and had advanced steadily over the years. Though she could not keep up with her husband, Li Yuanjiao, she had made remarkable progress.

Xiao Guiluan did not particularly like the color black, but since Li Yuanjiao favored dark, black-patterned robes, she followed his preference and dressed accordingly.

In the Li Family, Xiao Guiluan had always maintained a low profile. If Li Yuanjiao had been the clan head, her influence and status would undoubtedly be much greater. However, understanding that her husband disliked ostentation, she quietly focused on her cultivation atop the mountain.

As she exhaled a breath of pure qi, Li Yuexiang entered from the courtyard. Glancing at her mother, she asked, "Mother, where is Father?"

For as long as Li Yuexiang could remember, she had very few opportunities to spend time with her father. Although this wasn't ideal, Xiao Guiluan understood his reasons and raised Li Yuexiang on her own.

They were chatting and laughing together when the cave dwelling's doors suddenly creaked open. Li Yuanjiao strode out, looking relaxed, his cultivation seemingly having advanced.

"My dear!"

Xiao Guiluan joyfully approached him.

Li Yuanjiao embraced her, equally pleased after their time apart, though his first words were still the same.

"How are things at home?"

Xiao Guiluan replied, "Kong Tingyun has arrived as promised. She opened the fire vein on Wutu and left someone from Profound Peak Gate to guard it... The formation plate has been taken as well."

Although Li Yuanjiao had anticipated this, he still felt a pang of regret. After carefully inquiring about the details, he sighed and said, "What a pity! If I had not been injured by that Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from Mount Yue, capturing a demon from the Eastern Sea would have been no problem! The timing would have been perfect."

All of this had been within Li Yuanjiao's expectations. He then asked, "Anything else?"

In the two years of his seclusion, several significant matters had arisen. Xiao Guiluan lowered her voice and said, "Madam Lu failed to break through the Qi Cultivation Realm years ago and lost much of her lifespan... She is nearly seventy years old now... There is no chance for her to advance any further. Just a few days ago, word arrived—she has passed away."

With an air of melancholy, Xiao Guiluan continued, "She died on her bed, holding a meal box and two jade chopsticks. She had been cultivating in seclusion in the forest, with only two elderly servants by her side."

"Madam Lu...?"

Li Yuanjiao paused, momentarily stunned, before recalling that Madam Lu's full name was Lu Wanrong, the widow of Li Xuanling. She had lived alone in the mountains for many years.

Li Xuanling had been killed by the Maha, and Lu Wanrong, devastated by grief, had nearly taken her own life. She had remained stuck at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm for ten years.

With the potential to break through to Qi Cultivation Realm, those ten years of stagnation had effectively cut off her cultivation path. Later, her youngest son, Li Yuanyun, died in the market, pushing her to the brink of despair.

Although her daughter, Li Qinghong, had shown some promise, Lu Wanrong had lost all hope, retreating to the mountains to await her end.

Upon hearing this news, Li Yuanjiao could only sigh sadly.

"Qinghong will probably need another year to break through. I fear... she will not make it in time. Let Xijun and Xicheng see her off."

Xiao Guiluan nodded and, after carefully considering her words, added softly, "Your mother... likely does not have many days left either."

The mother she referred to was not Madam Dou, but instead Li Yuanjiao's birth mother, Mu Yalu, a concubine of Li Xuanxuan. She had married into the family from Mount Yue many years ago and was now approaching seventy.

"What?!"

The words struck Li Yuanjiao like a bolt from the blue, his face turning pale as he struggled to contain himself. Without a second thought, he soared into the air, riding the wind swiftly toward the town.

Xiao Guiluan followed closely behind, offering a few words of comfort, but Li Yuanjiao could not register them. He quickly descended into the courtyard of the large estate. An elderly servant, holding a basin, surprisingly still recognized him and called out, "Young Master!"

Li Yuanjiao waved at her and hurried inside. An old woman was lying on the bed.

When Mu Yalu had married into the Li Family, she was in her prime, but now she had grown frail and aged. Although she was a mortal, her high status and careful maintenance had allowed her to live more than ten years beyond the average lifespan.

She had been lying listlessly on the bed, but upon seeing Li Yuanjiao enter, her spirit visibly lifted. She struggled to sit up, speaking urgently, "Jiao'er... I heard you were injured by a Mount Yue cultivator... Are you alright?!"

Despite Li Yuanjiao's ruthless and gloomy nature when dealing with the outside world, he could no longer hold back upon hearing her words. He collapsed to his knees in front of her, choking back tears, "Mother! I'm fine!"

Mu Yalu smiled as she gazed at him, studying his expression and demeanor.

To others, Li Yuanjiao was always associated with suspicion and ruthlessness, and even his appearance had earned him a reputation as someone untrustworthy. But in Mu Yalu's eyes, he was exceptional. She grasped his hand, laughing constantly.

Xiao Guiluan ushered the servants out and closed the door. It was only then that Li Yuanjiao noticed another person sitting on a chair nearby—so emaciated that he looked like a piece of dead log draped in gray clothing, silently leaning against the side.

"Father."

Li Xuanxuan opened his eyes and nodded, his gaze lingering on Li Yuanjiao. Over the years, he had struggled with hallucinations, and he was squinting as he stared at Li Yuanjiao, as if trying to recall something.

The atmosphere between the three of them was unbearably heavy. Li Yuanjiao, not one for warm words, simply kneeled there in silence, watching as Mu Yalu's breath grew more labored.

Mu Yalu smiled at him the whole time, seemingly having no more to say, or perhaps having said it all. Eventually, her lips grew cold, her limbs icy, and her arms turned dark and bruised.

Li Xuanxuan silently smoked a pipe, the thin white smoke wafting through the air as the three sat in silence. They watched on quietly as Mu Yalu's breathing became shallower, her life force gradually slipping away.

"Hack!"

Li Xuanxuan coughed and stood, as if preparing to say something, but Li Yuanjiao only held his mother's lifeless body and walked out of the room, leaving him alone inside, surrounded by the haze of smoke.

The midday sun was at its peak, its harsh light filtering through the windows and illuminating his haggard face. Li Xuanxuan's expression was blank, but his trembling hands betrayed the deep turmoil within him.

After coughing twice more, he approached Xiao Guiluan, pulling three stacks of talismans from his storage pouch. The patterns were complex and colorful, representing a wide variety of talisman types. He then said loudly, "Guiluan! These are the talismans I drew this year!"

Xiao Guiluan, still stunned, took the talismans. Li Xuanxuan, muttering to himself, rode the wind and flew off, heading toward Mount Lijing to fetch more blank talisman paper.

For a moment, Xiao Guiluan stood there alone, not sure whether to hold onto the talismans or put them away. Her heart ached with grief and agitation. After placing them on the desk, she hurried off to follow Li Yuanjiao.

————

Xiao Guiluan soared through the sky, searching for her husband, and finally found him.

Li Yuanjiao stood before Li Tongya's grave, his expression already calm and devoid of sorrow. He rested his hand on his sword, gazing silently ahead.

The grave behind him was his older brother's, Li Yuanxiu. The headstone was covered in ash, and its edges had been worn smooth over time by years of touch. Many of the graves in the Li Family cemetery were cenotaphs, and this one was no different.

Li Yuanjiao exhaled slowly, glancing briefly at Xiao Guiluan before asking, "Is there anything else at home?"

Xiao Guiluan nodded, unsure of his current state, and after a hesitant pause, she said softly, "Kongheng... the monk, has left."

"Did he now?"

Li Yuanjiao showed no surprise, simply replying, "Did he return to the north or head for Heavenly Thunder Peak? And what of Li Xijun?"

Xiao Guiluan quietly replied, "He went to Heavenly Thunder Peak."

"Heavenly Thunder Peak huh...?"

Li Yuanjiao's expression darkened slightly. He spoke in a low voice, "Let us go. We will return to Qingdu Peak and ask Xijun about it."
