# Chapter 890: Heaven and Earth

Li Ximing glanced at the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual material before him. Although the item was precious, his heart remained calm. He merely said softly:

"It's from the Capital Guard path, isn't it? I have crossed blades with Yehui."

Daoist Master Xuanyi gave an imperceptible glance and nodded.

"Correct! This item is called Shangxiang Silver. Its origins are ancient. The Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition only possesses it because it was inherited from the Wanling Upper Sect."

"His other dharma artifacts are fine, but they mean little to me. Furthermore, fellow Daoist, you control an entire lake on the mainland; you certainly aren't lacking for resources. He had many treasures on him, but none compare to this box of spiritual materials."

Li Ximing had already secured the item, so he was naturally more at ease, but that didn't mean he would ignore the potential benefits right in front of him. He nodded.

"I know. The Capital Guard path is nearly extinct. The only one known on the mainland or beyond is the Capital immortals Dao. The Yehui I fought was quite skilled. This item is indeed precious."

"The Capital Guard..."

Xuanyi's expression turned faintly mocking as he replied:

"The various Immortal Dao paths may not always have the upper hand against Buddhist cultivators, but it is extremely rare for a Daoist tradition to be completely suppressed. Don't be fooled by Yehui's impressive display. When his Capital Guard path encounters a monk, the fight is... uncomfortable for him."

"Oh?"

The Capital Guard were almost extinct; this was the first Li Ximing had heard of such a weakness. Xuanyi seemed intent on adding fuel to the fire, lowering his voice.

"After Su Xikong attained the Dao, the temples of the Nine Provinces wept, and the Capital Guard Daoist tradition withered. It never prospered again. Several large sects submitted to Encompassing Profoundity Mountain. Later, when Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty ascended the great throne, he claimed to purge the mainland, felling mountains and destroying temples, completely severing the Capital Guard path. If Yehui hadn't obtained the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Treasury, this path would still be unknown today... In truth, this Profound Qi is also a sore spot for him."

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He offered his thanks, then watched as Xuanyi's expression turned serious.

"These four dharma artifacts all belong to Secret Diffusion. If fellow Daoist is willing, I will take three pieces of this spiritual material, leave two for you, and give you all the dharma artifacts as well... It's just..."

Xuanyi paused and sighed.

"It's just... I hope Bai Yinzi can pay a visit to my Mount Jingyi."

From the very beginning, his divine ability had been focused on Bai Yinzi, never releasing him for an instant. The young man appeared calm and breezy, but the flickering light of the "Black Cloud Silver Sparrow Bottle" at his waist revealed his master's determination.

'He is determined to have Bai Yinzi.'

Bai Yinzi, still on the floor, kept his head pressed tightly to the ground. He didn't move or speak, but his hands trembled where they lay. Even now, he couldn't understand why a group of Merciful Ones had fought to capture him, or why this man insisted on taking him by name.

Li Ximing fell silent for a moment before asking quietly:

"My family and Bai Yinzi are acquaintances. When we were gathering qi in the great desert, we stayed in his temple. Although we aren't deeply connected, I must still ask... How does Daoist Master Xuanyi plan to treat him?"

Daoist Master Xuanyi laughed. He lifted his robes slightly, revealing a pair of dark boots with silver-black patterns. He unfastied the Black Cloud Silver Sparrow Bottle from his waist and announced:

"This Corner-Cleansing Merit Bottle was passed down by my Master. It is a treasure of my Daoist tradition, but it is very heavy. If one's fate is not strong enough, holding it is a death sentence. I originally came to the mainland this time to find an disciple to carry the bottle."

A corner of his mouth twitched into a smile.

"This person can't be without cultivation... But as for talents like Su Yan or Xiao Yuan, first, I couldn't win a fight for them, and second, having them just carry a bottle would be a great waste. Bai Yinzi is at the Foundation Establishment Realm, at least. If I can't find a young disciple, an old man will have to do."

Li Ximing didn't fully believe him. He offered a meaningful reminder:

"Bai Yinzi doesn't have much lifespan left."

Xuanyi gave a noncommittal grunt. Li Ximing looked down at the old man.

"What about you?"

Only then did Bai Yinzi raise his head. His face was covered in sweat, his expression one of utter confusion.

Xuanyi came from a long line of Eastern Sea cultivators. He was only willing to say this much because of the Li family's reputation as pillars of the Righteous Path, and because Li Ximing was present. Did he truly care about Bai Yinzi's opinion? He let out a chuckle and said mockingly:

"You old fool, you don't know what's good for you. This is a great opportunity! Daoist Master Zhaojing said you don't have long to live. What's the point of struggling through these next few years? Follow me. I'll feed you a spirit medicine or two, and before you die, I'll find a new path for you. That's better than sitting around waiting to die, isn't it?"

"If you walk out of here today, you will certainly die. How can a Daoist Master follow you around day after day? Wouldn't that just be troubling him? Only by following me day after day will you find a path to survival!"

His words were half-truth, half-lie, spoken for both his listeners. Bai Yinzi began to kowtow forcefully, his head thudding against the floor.

"Thank you, Daoist Master! This lowly one understands!"

Li Ximing silently held his tea. Bai Yinzi's words had actually diffused much of the awkwardness. Since the old man had decided, Li Ximing didn't want to complicate matters. He asked:

"Senior Changxi made many arrangements before his death. Does Mount Jingyi know anything about them?"

Xuanyi waved his hand dismissively and drank his tea.

"Nothing major. Just protecting that Kong Gumo for him. Zhu Gong, on the other hand, went and rounded up his entire family. It makes things rather awkward for me. If Kong Gumo ever amounts to anything, won't she be the first one he hates?"

He seemed to have a good relationship with Daoist Master Zhu Gong, showing a "hating iron for not becoming steel" kind of frustration. He kicked up his boot.

"She hasn't had much contact with Buddhist cultivators, letting them just swallow her weapons... Ai, let's not talk about her. Thank you, Daoist Master Zhaojing, for your help!"

He hadn't finished speaking when he saw snowflakes drifting down from the sky. His expression immediately sobered, and he uncrossed his legs. "Qiuhu is here," he sighed. "It truly has been a long time!"

Li Ximing, of course, knew Ning Wan had arrived. Regardless of whether Xuanyi had reasons to avoid her, Ning Wan's arrival at his door was more important than this Eastern Sea cultivator. He immediately rose to greet her.

The celestial maiden, cloaked in wind and snow, landed on the platform. She swept her gaze across the scene, her eyes landing first on Li Ximing. She praised him:

"Daoist Master Zhaojing, you are formidable! Although I didn't go to Wang Xiaoxiao's location, Senior Kui Qi did. I heard the Merciful Ones all came up empty-handed. I never expected you to go for that Supreme Yin Dharma Sword!"

Li Ximing paused, stunned for a moment, then instantly understood. A chill ran through his heart.

'So those bald donkeys were all waiting for me there! No wonder there were so few people in the west!'

Although he had the Immortal Mirror to protect him, the situation in Jiangbei was chaotic, and countless eyes were watching. If he had really gone to the Wang family's location, while he might not have been seriously injured or killed, he certainly would have returned empty-handed.

Upon seeing Ning Wan, Xuanyi's demeanor became very proper. His former casual air vanished, replaced by a rather serious expression. He said formally:

"Daoist Friend Ning!"

The two had clearly met before. Ning Wan returned the salutation.

"Greetings, Brother Qu."

Xuanyi immediately shot to his feet, appearing somewhat hurried.

"Since Daoist Friend Ning has returned, the affairs in Jiangbei must be mostly concluded. I must depart quickly, lest I be cornered!"

With that, he secured the Corner-Cleansing Merit Bottle at his waist, divided the items, and spoke quickly:

"That fellow Sumian from Xuanmiao Temple... he puts on the appearance of a good person, but he's actually bent on throwing in his lot with the Demonic Path. And he has some resources, too. He got quite a few of Changxi's good things. Daoist Master Zhaojing, be careful. Don't let that old fox scheme against you."

Li Ximing shook his head inwardly.

Old Daoist Master Sumian of Xuanmiao Temple had spoken ill of Mount Jingyi long ago. And now this Xuanyi, for all his carefree demeanor, was just as merciless with his words.

'Which one of them can I trust? I'm afraid I can't trust either!'

The Daoist Master finally left in a whirlwind. The tremors from the north had also subsided. Ning Wan turned back, smiling.

"Congratulations, fellow Daoist... Seeing you unharmed is cause for celebration. After all, Five-Eyed leading a group of Merciful Ones is a real problem..."

"And that Nu Yan... he and the recently ascended Maha Nuzi are disciple-brothers, so his seniority is quite high. You sent him back to the Buddhist Land as well. Both Nu Xiao and Nu Yan were far more formidable than those subordinates of Taixi who couldn't even cast a proper Dharma Art. In my fight, I saw at least three Treasured Artifacts and four Dharma Arts. Those earlier opponents couldn't muster that much combined... It just shows... the foundation of the Way of Great Desire is much deeper than that of the Way of Emptiness!"

A worried look crossed Li Ximing's face. Ning Wan shook her head and sighed.

"Indeed... The situation with Bai Yinzi was relatively minor. On my side, at Xiao Yuan's location, not only did several cultivators from under the Golden Lotus Seat appear, but Vija and Nuzi also took action. Even the Lord of the White Victory Dao from the West High Plateau came..."

She paused, seeming to want to say more, but in the end, she only sighed.

"Houfu and Kui Qi are both in Jiangbei. If there weren't so many Buddhist cultivators, a massive battle would have been unavoidable."

The two spoke in detail for a while longer before Ning Wan finally said:

"Fei Qingya has been retrieved. The battle in Jiangbei hasn't stopped, but thankfully most of us have already withdrawn. I came back to find you mainly to check on your injuries. I'm heading to the riverbank to observe the situation. There might still be an opportunity. Do you want to come?"

Li Ximing had no heart to join her, using his injuries as an excuse. Ning Wan also had to see to the aftermath in the north, so she rode the wind and departed.

With Radiance and the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen, the injuries left by Nu Xiao were not serious; they would heal in a month at most. But he couldn't wait. Feigning calm, he didn't even examine the dharma artifacts he had received, nor did he spare a glance for the Shangxiang Silver tucked in his robes. He flew directly back and landed within his own Zhaoguang Profound Purple Great Array.

Palaces had already been constructed within the inner array. They were simple, spanning several levels. The highest main pavilion was naturally reserved for Li Ximing. The workers had already withdrawn, leaving few people behind. Li Ximing summoned Li Que'wan and instructed:

"Lock down the great array and stand guard outside. If anyone comes to visit, tell them I am in seclusion healing my wounds and cannot see anyone. If it is truly urgent, crush this jade talisman."

Li Que'wan knew exactly what her Daoist Master had been doing. She had been worrying on the island for a long time. Understanding completely, she quickly withdrew.

As the great array sealed, Li Ximing descended into the pavilion and shut the doors tightly. All the lights were extinguished, leaving only the purple-gold patterns of the inner array swirling overhead.

Li Ximing reached into his sleeve and took out the pure white spirit stone.

In the dim room, the spirit stone emitted no special light. It looked dull and lifeless, like a mundane object, utterly unremarkable. Li Ximing closed his eyes and began to chant in a low voice:

"Li Clan disciple Ximing, respectfully summons the Immortal Mirror. Patrol the unseen, probe the subtle, pierce the profound, illuminate all directions, capture ghosts and examine spirits..."

*Om...*

As his incantation finished, layers of bright white patterns spread through the air. A trace of the pitch-black Great Void appeared within them, as if a small tear had opened, shining with a clear, bright light.

The light fell upon the spirit stone, refracting into a myriad of colors. It instantly transformed from pure white to crystal clear, and then, in the next moment, the translucent stone vanished from before him, leaving only darkness.

The surroundings were utterly silent.

Li Ximing let out a soft sigh, feeling a sense of loss. But suddenly, something changed.

*BZZZT!*

His expression changed drastically. A cooling sensation spread through his Shengyang Acupoint Mansion. He saw a flash of white light rise up from beneath the layered radiance of his Bright Yang divine ability, forcing the divine ability itself to retreat and revealing a glowing white pellet.

The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed!

The white pellet bloomed from the inside out, expanding infinitely as if being inflated. It filled his entire Shengyang Acupoint from within, then leaped out to envelop the Shengyang Acupoint Mansion itself.

"Here now is a Li Clan disciple, spirit calmed and nature aligned, ascending to divine ability. Through his allotted years, he shall perfect his virtue, enabling him to ascend to heavenly fate, be recorded in the profound register, and attain his true name... Roam the five shadows, walk the Great Void, open the profound brightness, and renew the work of the Dao..."

*DONG!*

He felt his body shrink to an infinitesimal size. Before his eyes, an ancient bronze mirror spanning the Great Void suddenly appeared. Its surface reflected an entire world, with roiling clouds and mist, like a paradise.

Immediately, a chill spread from the back of his head, as if he had fallen into an ice cavern. The cold pierced him, and his spiritual sense blurred. He felt as if he were being drawn deep into the endless Great Void, his mind and form rising infinitely, floating, unaware of his location.

Following that, a two-colored light of yin and yang surged forth. A magnificent world unfolded. He saw a vast land covered in white snow, with clouds towering like mountains. Jade-white immortal palaces stood in neat rows. He also saw an immense, glittering golden lake, its water flowing like liquid gold, shimmering amidst the clouds. It was supported by layers of spiritual light, and across it lay twelve long, graceful bridges.

The world spun, and everything vanished. Finally, his feet touched solid ground. Li Ximing looked up. The floor beneath him was a glowing, jade-white surface. He found himself standing in a brightly lit pavilion.

This was no longer Moongaze Lake!

'What kind of technique is this!'

Li Ximing was terrified, but he didn't dare dwell on it. He quickly observed his surroundings.

The pavilion was a hundred feet square, exceptionally large for such a structure. It was built from grey stone and white jade. The ceiling bore no carvings, just a smooth, translucent white surface. A stone pillar lamp niche stood to his side, casting a gentle glow.

The place was neat and orderly, fully furnished with tables, chairs, tea tables, and meditation cushions, all arranged simply in the corners. It looked as if no one had been here for a long time.

The pavilion was silent, filled with a faint, diffuse light. Li Ximing stood by the wide-open window. He could see a boundless sea of clouds outside and the wondrous sight of the sun and moon shining together, one on the left and one on the right, high in the sky. Far off in the sea of clouds, other pavilions rose and fell, appearing and disappearing in the mist.

As the sea of clouds churned, an incredibly dense wave of Spiritual Qi washed over him, making Li Ximing catch his breath. He watched his surroundings with wary vigilance, not daring to move. His heart pounded.

"This is... This is!"

He had heard the chant clearly: "ascend to heavenly fate," "open the profound brightness," "renew the work of the Dao." Besides the immortal artifact his family had guarded for generations, could some True Monarch be playing a prank on him? Recalling what he had just seen, his heart throbbed with a new realization.

'To think I, a divine ability cultivator, could be moved to another place without even realizing it... Could it be... Could I be inside the world within the Immortal Mirror?'

The Li family's Talisman Seeds all eventually returned to the mirror's body. In ancient times, there were cases of grotto-heaven secret realms being attached to Spiritual Artifacts or Dharma Treasures. As for whether a world existed inside the Immortal Mirror, it was his family's only such treasure, so Li Ximing had no way of knowing.

But years ago, when he was overseas, the Talisman Seed had been triggered, and he had vaguely glimpsed a world just like this. He had been suspicious ever since, and now, he was almost certain.

He hesitated for a long moment before finally stepping forward slowly. He walked to the jade table in the center. Its surface was bright and clear, carved on both sides with patterns of osmanthus flowers and the bright moon. A porcelain-white vase sat in the middle, next to a strange, purplish-black wooden slip.

The items looked as if they had been placed casually. Suspicion grew in Li Ximing's heart, and he didn't touch them. He circled the pavilion once and spotted a token resting on one of the meditation cushions.

The token was about the length of his forearm, pure white, and engraved with beautiful silver-white Supreme Yin patterns. In the center was a flat, circular space, engraved with a simple, ancient seal script character. The moment Li Ximing saw it, he understood.

'Li.'
