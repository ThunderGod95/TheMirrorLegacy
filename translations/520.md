# Chapter 787: Feathered Robe

Yu Yuwei could only worry on his own. Li Xizhi didn’t understand artifact refinement and couldn’t be of much help. Azure Pond Sect’s path of artifact refinement had also withered since the deaths of those who had inherited Yuanwu’s mantle such as Tang Shecheng, Yu Xiuxian, and finally Yu Muxian. There were simply no skilled artificers to be found.

The old man wore a troubled expression as he lugged a large purplish-red cauldron around. He glanced at Li Xizhi and said, “Xizhi... the fallen grotto heaven is called Dongning Palace. A few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have already sent people in... Judging by the timing, I hear that gates like Crimson Reef and Xiukui, who usually don’t make moves, will arrive soon as well.”

Li Xizhi nodded, putting on a look of serious attention as Yu Yuwei mumbled, “These days, this old man can hardly see the full picture... Crimson Reef and Xiukui are constantly battling in the outer seas, and cultivators fall every month. Meanwhile, some Purple Mansion Realm elders seem to be turning back north to involve themselves in Mount Bianyan matters...

“Hard to grasp... truly hard to grasp!” The old man sighed heavily, then sat down in confusion.

Meanwhile, Li Quantao looked at the two and said, “Dongning Palace... It was once a cave dwelling for many cultivators of Ning State. Ning State was the homeland of Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun. The Jia, Jiang and Li Families from Ning State were Golden Core Realm immortal descendants, so many things must’ve been left behind. With the Wanglin Sect and Prince Ning... it’s bound to be tempting.”

Yu Yuwei thought even further but their acquaintance was shallow, so he didn’t say much to Li Quantao. He only nodded lightly and muttered, “Yesterday, I received word that my nephew, Yu Fuyu, has died. No one at home is willing to claim the body, so I have to go.”

The Yu Family was in such disarray they might as well have been enemies. Yu Yuwei showed no emotion when he spoke of his nephew’s death. He merely let his eyelids droop, exchanged a few pleasantries, tucked the cauldron into his robes, and rode the wind away.

Once the old man left the courtyard, Li Quantao stepped forward and said quietly, “Brother Zhi... the Yu Family is full of selfish and cruel people. Even though Yu Yuwei is older, that doesn’t mean he’s any better... be cautious.”

When Li Xizhi glanced at him, Li Quantao’s expression turned serious as he added, “Do you still remember the matter of Murong Xia, Brother Zhi? Your family must have records... The Yu Family acted without shame as they openly and righteously rounded up people with mana, built numerous corpse mounds, and even constructed a grand hall where Murong Xia devoured humans day and night.

“Though all the families suffered under Murong Xia and understood that the Yu Family had no choice... they still laughed, never tried to hide it, and even worshiped him from start to finish...”

Li Quantao shook his head and said grimly, “Truly disgraceful!”

Li Xizhi knew this matter as well and nodded slightly. Li Quantao continued, “Besides... Yu Yuxie’s death is also tied to Yu Yuwei. Rumor has it that he was deliberately harmed in a family feud. If someone can kill even his own brother, how can he be trusted?”

Yu Yuxie was clearly made into a pill for cultivation by Chi Wei... Li Xizhi’s expression sobered, but he couldn’t say it aloud. He simply replied, “Thank you for the warning, brother.”

As the two were conversing, a man approached from below, bowing and holding a green command token in both hands. He respectfully said, “Sirs, a celestial order from the upper sect.”

Azure Pond Sect had many ways of delivering orders. If a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator brought one, it would be a solemn matter. But now, they merely sent a token, and not even a messenger. It was clearly a sign of discontent.

Li Xizhi stood, brushed his sleeves, accepted the token with the proper gesture and channeled mana into it. When it shone green, he uttered, “Li Xizhi of Changtian Peak is to return to the station at Baixiang Valley within three days, and follow further orders.”

Mount Yan Pass.

Mist hung over Mount Yan Pass as black-robed cultivators descended on the wind. The cultivators below quickly greeted them. Li Wushao, as usual, wore a stern expression and said little, simply riding the wind downward.

As soon as he landed, he found a burly artifact smith dressed in red, with clinking metal tools hanging from his body, standing atop the wall and looking out. It was none other than Chu Minglian.

Chu Minglian had been refining artifacts in the city for the better part of this period. He had ties with the Li Family and was known for his hearty and generous nature, which had helped him blend in well.

When he saw Li Wushao land, Chu Minglian looked over in interest and asked, “Fellow Daoist Wushao... why haven’t we seen you visiting Lingu Lanying lately? And today you’ve returned so quickly...”

The garrison of Lingu Lanying from the Lingu Family was not far from Mount Yan Pass. Her mount was a white Hooked Serpent. Li Wushao often claimed he hadn’t seen such a beast in years and would go there to visit frequently.

Everyone understood what was really going on but refrained from teasing him. They were privately curious and constantly tried to pry out gossip, but Li Wushao was tight-lipped, which only made them more intrigued.

Li Wushao kept a straight face and only replied, “Greetings, Master... devil cultivators have been rampant lately. I fear missing orders, so it’s unwise to leave the formation.”

Li Wushao then drifted away on the wind. Chu Minglian watched, slightly puzzled, and after wandering around the pass for a while, he saw another woman flying in before the formation.

The woman had a lovely appearance and was at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. She wore a light jade-green Daoist robe that glowed with brilliant dharma light. It was clearly not an ordinary item. Her long black hair flowed like a waterfall, and was pinned with several hair ornaments. She was quite beautiful.

The woman bowed and spoke gently, “I am Lingu Lanying of the Jiachuan Lingu Family... I wish to meet Fellow Daoist Qinghong.”

“So it’s a fellow Daoist from Jiachuan Lingu. I am Chu Minglian,” replied Chu Minglian.

Chu Minglian was only here to refine artifacts and didn’t have the dharma artifact to open the formation. He waved politely as he looked Lingu Lanying over with a glance, and courteously stepped aside.

Lingu Lanying wasn’t in a rush. She waited quietly before the formation for a few minutes, and sure enough, someone approached. It was a bright and graceful female cultivator, who respectfully said, “Li Minggong of Qingdu greets senior.”

Her manner was quite agreeable. Lingu Lanying smiled softly and followed her through the formation, passing several city walls before arriving at a small hill. The furnishings on the hill were simple and unremarkable.

Inside the cave dwelling, she found a white-robed woman at a table reading a jade slip. A silver spear was lying flat in the hall. White lightning occasionally flickered around it, producing faint crackling sounds.

This must be the thunder cultivator, Li Qinghong... thought Lingu Lanying.

“Lingu Lanying greets Fellow Daoist!” Lingu Lanying studied her.

Li Qinghong also examined her in return, then smiled and stepped down from her seat, speaking warmly, “Lately, Wushao has been visiting often. I hope he hasn’t troubled you too much, Fellow Daoist!”

Lingu Lanying looked a little embarrassed and replied with a smile, “It’s no trouble at all. My Gu’er has someone to keep her company.”

From her tone, it was clear that Gu’er referred to the white serpent. Li Qinghong had a vague premonition and quietly speculated, What could Lingu Lanying want from me? I am pretty sure this is going to be about Li Wushao and that Gu’er...

After a round of pleasantries, Lingu Lanying finally said, “These past years, your family’s Wushao has grown close with my Gu’er... I’ve seen him many times. He’s sharp and capable, and though my Gu’er is still young, she’s learned quite a bit from him and gained a great deal.”

Li Qinghong nodded with a smile and said gently, “Fellow Daoist, are you suggesting...?”

Lingu Lanying smiled awkwardly and softened her tone, “It would naturally be wonderful if this could come to fruition... Our two families had ties long ago, and I myself have long admired senior...

“Gu’er and I spoke several times. She hesitated for a long while. She said that Wushao was strong, and the Li Family was a prestigious family. Wushao also treated her with great care, so she was very torn...”

At this point, Li Qinghong sensed something was off. Her expression sobered, and she remained silent as Lingu Lanying quietly continued, “But the young one is still... well, young. In the end, she made up her mind. It won’t work. Her family line has always been of the Pristine Water lineage, and she’s always dreamed of a Pristine Water cultivator as her husband. But Wushao... he’s of Mansion Water lineage...”

Lingu Lanying spoke very tactfully, but Li Qinghong wasn’t ignorant. She understood in her heart immediately, Pristine Water and Mansion Water. What nonsense! So in the end, they’re just looking down on Li Wushao’s mixed Hooked Serpent bloodline!

The Hooked Serpent was a descendant of the Pristine Water Feathered Serpent, and the Pristine Water line was considered the most pure and noble among them. Li Qinghong had seen Gu’er before; she was much larger than most Hooked Serpents, with sleek, refined scales and an aura of elegance and nobility.

Other types, like Converging Water or Pit Water, were lesser, being descended from subordinate lines of the Feathered Serpent. Mansion Water was the only one not represented among the many Hooked Serpent clans, making it, naturally, the lowest of the low.

Before meeting Li Yuanjiao, Li Wushao had been destitute and his cultivation weak to the point of fleeing into Lake Xian. That had much to do with his bloodline.

Li Qinghong’s heart grew cold. After so much time together, the cultivators here had long considered Li Wushao one of their own. This left her deeply displeased.

Lingu Lanying hadn’t lied, and though she had phrased it gently, she felt bitterness in her heart. When she saw Li Qinghong’s neutral expression, she could only explain, “This visit carries no disrespect. I simply wished to speak to senior in person... I’ve also brought an apology gift, hoping you might understand.”

Things had reached this point, and even Lingu Lanying felt deeply troubled. The Hooked Serpent Gu’er at her side was the only daughter of a revered and powerful elder serpent within their family. Lingu Lanying had no choice but to show her some respect.

When she first heard about the two serpents, she had been excited for a day or two. Since the Li family was currently ascending, Lingu Lanying was eager to establish ties. But no matter how pleased she was with the potential marriage, it wasn’t a decision she could make alone. How could she force Gu’er to submit?

At this point, Lingu Lanying seemed rather flustered. Li Qinghong could see the difficulty in her eyes, and her own impulse to lash out subsided. She sighed softly and said, “This is simply a matter of mutual affection. There’s no need for any apology gift, please take it back.”

Now that she had been dragged into this mess for no reason, Li Qinghong had little patience left. The Lingu Family was among the top families. She had already shown enough courtesy and had no desire to say more.

Li Qinghong brushed her off with a few perfunctory words. Seeing her sour expression, Lingu Lanying quickly took her leave. Just as Li Qinghong was about to summon Li Wushao, Li Minggong hurried over and said respectfully, “Aunt, Master Chu has finished crafting the feathered robe!”

The feathered robe was originally a brocade garment captured from a devil cultivator, and had once belonged to the Wanglin Upper Sect. Chu Minglian had taken a liking to it and spent a long time modifying it, incorporating every rare material he could find. After much effort, it was finally complete.

“Oh?” Li Qinghong’s eyes lit up.

She exited the cave with Li Minggong, just in time to see Li Wushao and Kongheng waiting outside. Kongheng’s cultivation had advanced, and he looked radiant. Li Wushao stood quietly to the side.

Since there were many people present, Li Qinghong didn’t speak further and simply said softly, “Let’s see the feathered robe first.”

Mount Yan Pass had once been home to a minor sect. There was a fire vein on the mountain, and the group rode the wind down to a furnace platform where Chu Minglian was waiting. His hearty face beamed with joy. He cupped his hands to Li Qinghong, then swept his sleeve over the table. A white feathered robe appeared upon it.

The elegant and regal feathered robe gleamed with pure white feathers. It had a ring of beautiful cyan-blue plumes around the collar and shoulders, emitting a halo-like glow. The feathers flowed downward in waves, weaving cyan, blue, and white into a jewel-like tapestry.

The shimmering iridescence of the robe captivated everyone’s eyes. Chu Minglian was obviously proud as his gaze moved lovingly across the garment. He was clearly reluctant to part with it.

“This feathered robe originally belonged to the Wanglin Upper Sect but was later altered by a devil cultivator into something unrecognizable. I removed the gaudy embellishments and reworked many details. It’s no longer what it once was.

“I also reinterpreted many of the ancient design elements. After all, the True Monarch’s essence is now of Metallic nature, and many aspects are no longer suited to the original form.”

He let out a hearty laugh, confidence brimming in his voice, “What’s more, since the Fruition Attainment of the True Monarch of the Jade True Unified Void Essence, I’ve carefully modified all the arrays and incantations. Its power now surpasses what it once was and enhances the wearer far more effectively.”

Chu Minglian’s expression turned serious as he declared, “I may not match Tang Shecheng of old, but the foundation of this feathered robe is excellent. In its current form, it’s absolutely on par with the dharma robes of the direct descendents of Azure Pond and Golden Feather Sects!”

This feathered robe was certainly not of the same class as the Xia You spirit fan, but even resting on the table, it radiated an aura that stirred the soul. Li Qinghong picked it up gently, her face alive with joy.

“As for its defensive abilities, those go without saying. It can easily withstand casual attacks from an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. If you, Qinghong, actively channel your mana into it and reinforce the surface, its effect will rise to the next level.” Chu Minglian explained, “First, the Cyan Plume. This robe retains techniques from the Wanglin Sect of old. The devil cultivators who obtained it had no idea how to use them, and so they lay dormant for years. If you channel mana into the thirty-two tail feathers, they will emit cyan light, like a thunderous and swift bird soaring to the sky. Whether flying through the heavens or diving into the sea, the effect is formidable.

“Second, the Tranquil Frost. The robe incorporates materials like Cold-metal and Ice-jade. The moment you put it on, Qinghong, it will produce a calming, icy aura. Whether for cultivation or resisting illusions in combat, it offers remarkable benefits!”

Li Qinghong was already enamored with the robe. The cyan, blue, and white hues of the feathers flowed through her hands and past her pale wrist.

Chu Minglian chuckled and said, “I also crafted a technique called Imperial Plume. The robe’s thirty-two cyan tail feathers can now be released all at once, each trailing radiant light. Every feather flies like an arrow, it will be extremely effective against numerous enemies.”

“Many thanks, Senior!” said Li Qinghong, smiling gently.

Chu Minglian nodded, his broad face glowing with pride, and asked, “This robe may only be a refitted piece, but it’s the best work I’ve ever produced. Qinghong, have you decided on a name for it?”

Li Qinghong gave a slight nod, watching the colors flow across her palm and the soft swaying of the cyan tail feathers in the wind. After a moment’s thought, she replied, “Let’s call it Cyan Sparrow Plume!”
