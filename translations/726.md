# Chapter 726: Four Borders

The mountain shot into the sky. Li Ximing, treading on the celestial light, saw Kong Guxi leaning against a tree in the forest, his face a mask of panic. He had none of the bearing expected of the Profound Peak Gate's master.

'They had no successor, so Changxi had no choice but to pick him,' Li Ximing mused. 'An obedient puppet was the best he could hope for, not someone with true grit. Besides, any man would be stunned after watching his clan's Purple Mansion cultivator perish.'

Although Changxi had never truly taken him into his confidence, he was still a senior who had offered much guidance during Li Ximing's early days in the Purple Mansion Realm. Out of respect for the man, if not his schemes, Li Ximing bowed his head in a silent salute.

Below, the people from the Xuanmiao Temple were still exclaiming in awe and praise. Their voices carried clearly enough for even Kong Guxi to hear, let alone cultivators with divine abilities like Li Ximing and Sumian. No matter how tragic his end, Changxi had been a Purple Mansion Daoist Master. Li Ximing simply raised his head and clasped his hands behind his back, remaining silent.

A man of Sumian's perception could tell from a single glance that Li Ximing was displeased. The Xuanmiao Temple had a relaxed, traditional structure without many strict rules, so things had gotten a bit disorderly. He waved a hand, signaling Qiuxin to go down and disperse the crowd.

Kong Guxi had already taken to the air, clutching a set of Daoist robes to his chest, intending to return and arrange a burial. He stopped before Li Ximing and bowed respectfully. "Greetings, Daoist Master. From this day forward, the Profound Peak Gate will follow your lead."

Li Ximing nodded. Once Kong Guxi was steady in the celestial light, he turned to Sumian and finally voiced the question that had been nagging him. "Senior Sumian, where is Daoist Master Xuanyi?"

Li Ximing remembered it all perfectly. Changxi's support hadn't just come from the Xuanmiao Temple; there was also Mount Jingyi overseas. Daoist Master Xuanyi had taken Yuezhou Island and accepted other benefits from Changxi. In fact, Changxi's premature death was partly due to the aid he'd given Mount Jingyi. Yet now that Changxi was dead, Xuanyi was nowhere to be seen!

At Li Ximing's question, Sumian shook his head, no longer bothering to hide the blatant disgust on his face. "Xuanyi is no saint. With Changxi gone, this is clearly a troublesome situation. What overseas Purple Mansion Daoist Master would eagerly jump into this mess?"

He paused before adding, "Xuanyi is on bad terms with the Chunyi Dao Gate. Guanghou, a Daoist Master from their lineage, has just achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, so Xuanyi's hands are tied. He can't come."

The Chunyi Dao Gate was another ancient, traditional lineage. Qiuxin had once worked with them to ambush demonic cultivators from Jiangnan, securing the Purple Flame Cauldron for the Li Clan. The relationship between the Xuanmiao Temple and the Chunyi Dao Gate was clearly a close one, which explained Sumian's dislike for Xuanyi.

Understanding this connection, Li Ximing saw the root of Sumian's animosity. But this wasn't the time to worry about Xuanyi. He needed to clarify the Xuanmiao Temple's position.

He glanced at Kong Guxi, who still seemed lost in a daze, and decided to speak for him. "With Senior Changxi's passing, the celestial phenomena and shifting ley lines have made the news plain for all to see. The White Ye Immortal Sect has long coveted the Shanji region. Senior, you promised to protect the Profound Peak Gate. What are your plans?"

Daoist Master Sumian stroked his beard and replied softly, "Brother Changxi was a friend to our Xuanmiao Temple for many years. We cannot simply stand by. However, the Profound Peak Gate's territory is vast, and covetous wolves lurk on all four of its borders. I fear our two families alone cannot protect it all. We must be prepared to cede some land. The lives of our disciples are what matter most."

The Profound Peak Gate's territory was centered around Shanji and their own mountain sect, with their influence extending to the wilderness around Lake Xian. Sumian's first instinct was to give up ground. Li Ximing had to ask, "Senior, what exactly are you suggesting?"

Sumian shook his head. "Zhaojing, rest assured. Our Xuanmiao Temple cultivators are already on their way to garrison the Lake Xian area. After all, the lake is part of our heartlands, and we cannot allow turmoil there. As for the wilderness to the west... I'm afraid our reach is too short."

The Li Clan and the Xuanmiao Temple perfectly bracketed the Profound Peak Gate, bordering them at the wilderness and Lake Xian, respectively. The implications of Sumian's words were instantly clear to Li Ximing. 'So that's how it is... The Xuanmiao Temple will absorb the Profound Peak Gate's influence over Lake Xian, and they're leaving the wilderness for my family to handle.'

It seemed like an even split, with each taking a border, but it was anything but! Not only did the Li Clan share a long border with the White Ye, but even a fool like Yehui knew of the Xuanmiao Temple's long-standing neutrality. He would only have to deal with the Li Clan.

'The Xuanmiao Temple's "defense" is just an excuse to swallow up the territory around Lake Xian!'

As a fellow Purple Mansion cultivator, how could Li Ximing not see through the ploy? His brow furrowed instantly. But Sumian's tone remained firm as he continued, "Zhaojing, do not worry. I will go and speak with Yehui personally. Out of respect for Brother Changxi, whose body is not yet cold, he won't let things escalate too drastically. If a real crisis occurs, I promise I will not stand idly by."

Sumian's meaning was clear: the Li Clan would face the Immortal Sect alone. The Xuanmiao Temple was unwilling to send its people to offend Yehui. However, if it came to a battle between Purple Mansion cultivators, Sumian was at least willing to mediate. Li Ximing listened in silence as Sumian turned to Kong Guxi. "Your sect's mountain is right next to Lake Xian. If you face any difficulties, or if any of your disciples are injured, send them over at once. The Xuanmiao Temple will not ignore their plight."

"The same goes for Moongaze Lake."

Li Ximing felt a headache coming on. Fortunately, Kong Guxi finally spoke up, his voice respectful. "Daoist Master, before our ancestor passed, he instructed this junior to follow Daoist Master Zhaojing's arrangements in all matters. We await your command."

Sumian nodded. Li Ximing had long understood the way these Purple Mansion Daoist Masters operated. They might appear benevolent and charitable, but they would never sacrifice their own strength to save another's. They had made grand promises while Changxi was alive, but now that he was dead, they would swallow up their share of the benefits, and any further action would depend entirely on their conscience. In that regard, Sumian was already far better than Xuanyi.

But Li Ximing couldn't afford to linger. Bidding a quick farewell, he tore open the Great Void and pulled Kong Guxi through the rift, traveling at incredible speed. "What are the Profound Peak Gate's defensive arrangements?" he asked as they moved. "Don't leave anyone at Lake Xian. Move all your forces to guard the wilderness."

Kong Guxi had managed to regain some composure. "Daoist Master, our ancestor gave instructions for our defenses before he passed. We currently have three early-stage, one mid-stage, and one late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator from our direct lineage, along with nine guest elders, all stationed on the riverbank in the wilderness. Lake Xian has been left completely undefended."

'Changxi really had planned ahead,' Li Ximing thought, relieved. 'Otherwise, he wouldn't have said what he did to me.' Fourteen Foundation Establishment cultivators, while lacking any truly exceptional individuals, represented the core strength of an entire immortal clan. They wouldn't be broken through easily. He then asked about the Profound Peak Gate's single most capable warrior: "Where is Fuyuezi?"

"Guarding the wilderness," Kong Guxi replied.

The Li Clan's main force was stationed on the eastern coast, perfectly positioned to reinforce the wilderness to the northeast or Funan to the northwest. And just a few days prior, Li Xizhi had secretly recalled Li Wushao and Li Qiyun, who were now both on the eastern coast as well.

In the time it took to exchange a few sentences, they arrived at the border of the wilderness. Li Ximing prepared to drop him off, giving one last order. "The Purple Mansion Daoist Master of Mount Jingyi is indisposed, but he must have disciples. Doesn't your clan have someone studying under him? Have that person invite a few of his martial brothers to lend their aid!"

Kong Guxi nodded hastily. "I will prepare generous gifts at once and send someone to Mount Jingyi. I'll have my cousin ask for assistance."

...

Baijiang Creek.

For the past year and a half, the Midong region could only be described as superficially stable. The prominent local clans were well-informed and knew something of the Kong family's situation, leading to widespread unease. They showed little interest in the stipends offered by the Li Clan, merely going through the motions.

On Hongfu Peak, lights burned brightly as cultivators hurried in and out. A young man with eyes like polished lacquer sat in the main seat, six tokens floating at his waist. Old Man Qu bustled in from below. "My lord, the Northern Brocade River King's messenger has arrived. He reports movement in the White Ye territory."

Among the Li Clan's Foundation Establishment cultivators, Li Chenghui was the most cautious. He had arranged for the Northern Brocade River King's men to stay on a side peak, changing out their communication jades monthly to ensure the timely delivery of news. After all, it only took the messenger a half-hour to fly over, and in a rebellious region like this, relying on a tiered notification system was just asking for trouble.

The moment the message arrived, Li Chenghui shot to his feet. He had just received word of geological shifts in the Profound Peak Gate's territory when Ying Hebai's news came in. His voice was grim. "Daoist Master Changxi has fallen. Get Ding Weizeng. All Foundation Establishment cultivators are to pull back immediately. Do not retreat via Hongfu Peak."

Since no word had come from Li Zhouwei, and no reinforcements were coming from the clan, Hongfu Peak was indefensible. Midong had never been a true strategic priority for the Li Clan; besides the land itself, it held little of value. Everything that could be moved had already been transferred to Funan over the last two years.

And besides the land and the local clans, what was the most valuable thing in Midong?

The Grand Celestial Cloud-Gathering Array on Hongfu Peak, of course!

Li Chenghui had focused on three tasks over the years. First, he moved Midong's commoners—those unaffiliated with the powerful clans—to populate Funan, never touching the cultivators. Second, he appointed cultivators from the local clans to high positions, generously distributing the spirit fields that Wenhu of Midong had painstakingly converted from private to public ownership.

In less than two years, Midong had not only seen a portion of its population drain away, but the consolidation of spirit fields had reached an unprecedented level, and the Li Clan had profited handsomely from the resales.

His third task had been to map the region's spiritual veins, ley lines, and waterways, working overtime to copy the platform of the Grand Celestial Cloud-Gathering Array. Now, by taking the priceless array plate and destroying the formation, he would leave Hongfu Mountain defenseless—a paradise for rogue cultivators and local clans to fight over.

Without pausing, he walked outside, continuing his orders, "We don't have time to deal with them. These clans and rogue cultivators, who so righteously want to drive our Li Clan out, won't pass up this opportunity. Let them fight over it. When the Immortal Sect's forces arrive, they'll surely have to leave a few people behind to suppress them."

Qu Bushi followed him out and whispered, "The spiritual energy in Jiangbei is flourishing. We could excavate the ley lines and sever the spiritual veins... we could also fill in the waterways..."

Li Chenghui retrieved the array plate from its stone pedestal in the main hall. It was an incredibly complex disk, covered in patterns like woven silk. Hearing Qu Bushi's words, Li Chenghui immediately shot the idea down. "Are you trying to get yourself killed? This is Jiangbei, not the Eastern Sea. No one touches the land in Jiangbei. Not even a Purple Mansion Daoist Master would dare!"

Qu Bushi froze, realizing his mistake. He fell silent and retreated. The two made their way off the mountain. Fearing Ding Weizeng and the others hadn't received his orders, Li Chenghui crushed another communication jade as a reminder. Just as they crossed out of Midong's borders, a pillar of fire erupted from Hongfu Mountain. The grand array shattered, its brocaded clouds sinking and scattering like rain.

It was followed by dozens of streaks of spiritual light, all hesitantly ascending toward Hongfu Mountain. The local clans had clearly noticed. Li Chenghui, already several miles out of Midong, glanced back to the north with a hint of regret.

"Midong is a truly prosperous land. One day... if we have the chance to return, we will set things right and bring these clans to heel."

He sped away on a current of lightning. An incense stick's time later, he crossed into Funan. The contrast with Midong was stark: here, the villages were sparse but orderly, all under the protection of a pristine, glowing array. A woman flew out to meet him.

It was Li Minggong, dressed in red and holding the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, riding a plume of fire. Behind her was An Siwei, clad in jade armor and carrying a spear. Worry was etched on Li Minggong's face. "You've arrived just in time," she said. "I just received word. Guan Gongxiao, the head disciple of the Immortal Sect, is leading a force into the wilderness. The clan head has already gone ahead. They've likely engaged the enemy by now."

"Thankfully, you didn't try to defend Hongfu Mountain and have freed up your forces. I am needed to guard this position and cannot leave. Please, hurry and provide reinforcements."

Li Chenghui hadn't expected the enemy to strike so swiftly. "How many cultivators?" he asked grimly.

Li Minggong shook her head, her voice tinged with anxiety. "It's hard to know for sure... Guan Lingdie and Gongsun Bofan have both been spotted, along with several other well-known Foundation Establishment cultivators who were recalled from overseas."

Li Cheng processed the information instantly. "It seems this Guan Gongxiao has sent local turncoats like Song Yunbai and Wang He to attack Jiangbei, while his main force heads for the eastern coast. I'll head over now. Ding Weizeng is right behind me; please brief him when he arrives."

Without another moment's delay, Li Chenghui led his men eastward, vanishing over the horizon at top speed.

Li Minggong, tasked with defending Funan—a vital buffer for Moongaze Lake and arguably more important than the wilderness itself—could only watch him go.

A short while later, before Ding Weizeng's forces had even arrived, she felt a tremor in the ley lines to the east. But then, a golden radiance erupted in the northwest. A wave of dread washed over her. Riding her fire higher, she peered into the distance and saw streaks of light racing across the border, formations shattering, and a torrent of metallic energy surging into the sky.

Li Minggong knew at once that something was wrong. She summoned a Jade Court Guard. "Go to the clan immediately and request aid! Have several Foundation Establishment cultivators reinforce Funan. This is critical—do not delay!"

The guard hurried off. Li Minggong then crushed a communication jade. Her clan's senior had two spirit beasts on the eastern coast; they could arrive in fifteen minutes. Having taken these precautions, she felt a surge of confidence and immediately set off with An Siwei, riding the wind.

An Siwei looked toward the disturbance, his expression instantly tightening with tension. His father, An Zheyan, was stationed near that area. Though he was a good distance away and the old man was sharp, An Siwei couldn't help but surge forward.

'I never should have assigned him to that post!'

An Zheyan was getting on in years, so he'd been given the safest, most relaxed assignment. An Siwei had never anticipated a sudden attack from the northwest, which had now put his father in grave danger.

Fortunately, the old man had accumulated a good number of protective treasures over the years and was stationed slightly behind the border, not directly on it. It seemed he had managed to escape. As the two Foundation Establishment cultivators sped onward, straining their eyes, they saw the old man flying toward them, cloaked in a bloody light.

An Zheyan had always been completely bald, and now his beard and eyebrows were completely white. Back when Li Ximing first reached the Purple Mansion Realm, he had restored the severed limbs of An Zheyan, Li Qiuyang, and several other elders. Now, with all four limbs intact, he looked much healthier, though the lines on his face had deepened with age.

He came to a hurried stop before Li Minggong as the golden energy on the horizon flared even brighter. The old man coughed up a mouthful of blood and cried out in alarm, "My lady! Situ Mo, the master of the Golden Tang Gate... he's leading his cultivators... they've crossed the mountains!"
