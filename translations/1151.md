# Chapter 1151: Dui Resides in Imperfection

In the distance, the lake’s surface shimmered, a wash of brilliant color. The divine ability, the Celestial Gate, had already stood for fifty-eight days. Its white bricks were immaculate, gleaming with a crystalline light, and its two white pillars plunged into the lake, while at its center, a bright light pulsed, shimmering and indistinct.

It was like a monument to eternal merit and imperial glory, a gate that had stood immutable since time began.

“I heard from those below that the waters of Lake Xian have dropped by another inch. The fish and Flood Dragons have gone into hiding, and all demonic things have fled.”

Gusts of cool wind swept across the summit of Profound Peak Gate. For the seventh time, the old man emerged from the hall to look. His slightly clouded eyes were wide, gazing tremulously at the spectacle on the lake. He turned back and asked, “A battle is inevitable, isn’t it?”

Nearby, Kong Xiaxiang, the Master of Profound Peak Gate, stood motionless. His face, once marked by frivolity and then despair, had settled into a hard-won maturity. Yet as he faced the profound and mysterious Celestial Gate, it still betrayed a tangible dread.

“Yes… they all say it is. Troops from the Li Clan’s Jade Court Guard have already been mobilized. They’re stationed at the foot of the mountain.”

The old man and the younger one fell silent.

Kong Guxi, a lost expression on his face, rose from his seat, completely at a loss. He looked closely at Kong Xiaxiang, saw the terror in his eyes, and then turned away. After hesitating several times, he spoke, his voice trembling.

“We have yet to repay their great kindness… how can we bear to draw our blades against them?”

Silence descended upon the mountain. Kong Xiaxiang did not know how to answer him. Then a gentle breeze swept past, and a woman in yellow-colored robes appeared. With a thud, Kong Guxi fell to his knees.

“My lady… Daoist Master!” he cried. “How can I possibly face the old Daoist Master in the great beyond!”

As he wept, his full head of silver hair trembled.

How could Kong Guxi not know what Profound Peak Gate had relied upon to survive until this day? But he knew with even greater clarity that without Daoist Master Zhaojing, Profound Peak Gate would have been crushed like an ant long ago.

For the longest time, the Kong Clan had rationalized the south’s designs on their Shanji lands, while Profound Peak Gate numbed itself with the need for self-preservation. But as the situation shifted time and again, culminating in the Celestial Gate rising from Lake Xian, their sole benefactor was about to become their sworn enemy. Kong Guxi’s heavily burdened heart finally shattered.

The old man knelt on the peak, weeping helplessly into his hands. Kong Tingyun looked down at him, her eyes clouded and her lips sealed.

Her breakthrough had pieced the fractured Profound Peak Gate back together and saved their Dao Lineage. Yet the sect remained like a sickly old man clinging to life; its new generation had yet to mature. More fatal still was the escalating conflict between north and south, which was slowly hoisting this frail old man up to the gallows.

She was an intelligent woman and had long since smelled the scent of danger. She could feel the thin cord around her neck pulling ever tighter, as if ready to snap her life away at any moment.

But the northern cultivators behind her—Guanhua, and even Qi Lanyan—did not care. The monk all those years ago had made it sound so simple: the key to breaking the deadlock lay in one's cultivation. If she, Kong Tingyun, truly possessed such talent, she should have broken through sooner, and Profound Peak Gate should never have suffered such a calamity!

Faced with the old man’s grief, Kong Tingyun could only offer silence. He wiped his tears and straightened up, as if afraid of troubling her further.

“I have considered this for so long but never dared to speak, for fear of disturbing the Daoist Master’s judgment. Not even ten thousand deaths could atone for it… Pay this old fool no mind.”

Kong Xiaxiang helped him to his feet and they retreated hastily. Just then, a bright light flared in the sky. From the Great Void, a divine ability parted the skies, and a procession of Daoist Masters descended upon galloping clouds.

The leader’s expression was calm. He wore a Daoist robe of white silk edged in gold, embroidered with profound patterns of black clouds. It was, of course, Qi Lanyan. But what truly captured her attention was the Daoist beside him, a man with a sharp gaze who was stroking his white beard.

Wang Ziya of the Numinous Treasure Order!

Her gaze lifted to meet his. As he descended from the clouds, Wang Ziya was also watching her. He listened as Qi Lanyan spoke quietly.

“This is Kong Tingyun, a descendant of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition.”

Hearing the word “descendant,” Wang Ziya’s heart stirred. “A descendant of our tradition, then,” he asked. “Under whom did she study?”

Kong Tingyun’s eyes flickered.

“My grandmaster was Luo Yuan, an in-name disciple of Great Daoist Master Lü Bai.”

“So, a successor from Lü Bai’s line!”

Wang Ziya clasped his hands politely.

“I am Wang Ziya of the Numinous Treasure Order. My grandmaster was Wu Ni, third on our Dao-path, and I studied under the True Monarch of Nurturing Life and Prosperous Treasures, Xu Xiang.”

A bitter taste filled Kong Tingyun’s mouth.

“Greetings, my lord,” she said in a low voice.

After so many years under the banner of the northern cultivators, how could she not have investigated the origins of her own Dao Lineage?

Her ancestor, Daoist Master Luo Yuan, had been merely an in-name disciple of Lü Bai. He lacked talent but possessed exceptional sword arts, which was how he had built his reputation. Daoist Master Changxi had placed their lineage under Luo Yuan’s name precisely because this ancient cultivator had roamed the world as a champion of justice before falling in battle, and had imparted his teachings so widely they were impossible to trace.

By contrast, the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao to which Qi Lanyan and Wei Xuanyin belonged, despite having been reduced to a mortal lineage, could be traced back to True Monarch Guanhua, a direct disciple of the Master of Comprehending Profoundity himself.

The Numinous Treasure successor before her was no less impressive. Who had not heard of the renowned True Monarch Xu Xiang?

Though Guanhua and Comprehending Profoundity now acknowledged Profound Peak Gate’s status, Kong Tingyun understood just how low that status was. Wang Ziya appeared unconcerned, but the moment she spoke Luo Yuan’s name, he had already dismissed her as someone who had barely managed to cling to a connection.

As a thousand thoughts raced through her mind, Wang Ziya was secretly filled with pity.

‘Martial Nephew Qi is cruel indeed. Introducing her as “a descendant of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition,” not “a direct successor.” A single word, yet the difference is as vast as heaven and earth! The descendant families of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition are spread across the north, but how many are ever acknowledged as true successors?’

While Qi Lanyan might bluff with others, he was extremely careful with his words around Wang Ziya. The Daoist stroked his beard, his expression complex, and said only,

“You’ve endured much, standing guard over this place.”

At his words, Qi Lanyan’s expression shifted slightly. Kong Tingyun offered a polite reply, but Wang Ziya waved his hand, his gaze turning south.

“It’s about time,” Qi Lanyan said softly. “Murong Yan!”

As his voice fell, a stout man appeared. His heart seethed with hatred and disgust, but he maintained a polite facade, offering a smile that did not reach his eyes.

“What instructions does Lord Qi have for me?”

Qi Lanyan beckoned him forward, then turned back and asked softly, “And where might Liangli Maha Zhelu be?”

The Great Void stirred, and a monk in a kasaya materialized. His eyes held a strange, malevolent light as he smiled.

“Does Lord Qi have some use for this humble monk?”

Qi Lanyan’s expression grew cold.

“The Celestial Gate on the lake is plain to see, but we must guard against his trickery. Should he use some deception, we might find ourselves striking at empty air. One of you is Maha Liangli, the other cultivates Valley Water. Enter the lake at once and test him.”

Zhelu’s eyes darted, his expression inscrutable. Qi Lanyan laughed.

“Your Void Dao’s treasure is still in his hands. If you don’t give it your all, you won’t get it back!”

Zhelu had been waiting for those very words. Hearing Qi Lanyan confirm the news, he was overjoyed. The handsome monk smiled and nodded. Qi Lanyan then turned to Murong Yan, a half-sincere smile on his face.

“Fellow Daoist Murong, in the battle today, I will honor you with the title of Guardian of the White Sea, to command our cultivators. Success will bring great merit. Failure will mean the loss of the entire White Sea…”

Murong Yan’s face changed. He was about to refuse when he looked up and saw the youth’s sinister gaze sweep over him. Qi Lanyan’s expression was calm as his lips buzzed, his words wrapped in a divine ability:

‘I have tolerated you for eighteen years, as has the Murong clan. How many more chances do you think you have? If the White Sea is lost, we will need a scapegoat, and I’ll make you the sacrificial offering!’

Shock and fury warred on Murong Yan’s face, but under Qi Lanyan’s icy stare, he remained silent.

‘You stubbornly refuse to take refuge in the Buddhist path. But when the time comes, I’ll have the Murong clan take your head back to bear the karma for losing Jianghuai. We’ll see then if they are willing to honor you as a golden statue to your “great compassion” that prevented you from slaying your enemies… and enthrone it in the Buddhist Lands!’

…

Boom!

A fierce wind howled and rain lashed down in sheets. Gloomy thunder cracked within the clouds, and a vivid silver-white light coalesced above the sword peak.

The peak had once been a place for cultivating Dui Metal. Its concentrated Metal Qi drew Profound Thunder, and even with the protection of Horn Wood, bolts of lightning still lingered, weaving through the air.

For fifty-eight days, Cheng Jiuwen had been kneeling quietly beneath the tree. The air was cold and clear despite the sudden, violent downpour, yet not a single drop disturbed the table before him. The tea in his cup was as placid as a mirror, reflecting his eyes.

His heart was filled with worry.

‘After all… it is the path of supplementing Dui with Geng!’

The Dao Lineage of the Sword Gate was the Taiyu Nurturing Essence Scripture, a grand Dao that was originally complete with all five metals. However, the final part, the Golden Aperture Heart, had long ago lost its qi, leaving it empty.

The lineage was, for all intents and purposes, complete. Yet the number of Sword Gate cultivators who reached the rank of Great Daoist Master was pitifully small. Apart from the patriarch Cheng Liuxing and his disciple, only one other in later generations, a certain Yanying, had reached that realm—but he was not of Dui Metal, nor was he a Sword Immortal. The Sword Gate had few divine abilities to begin with, and even less experience concerning the Purple Mystery.

Combining different types of divine abilities was the greatest taboo. Though Geng and Dui were often complementary, a moment of carelessness could easily affect one’s temperament and Dao-path. And that was to say nothing of the fact that Lingmei also had to contend with the Delusion of the Womb.

From the Underworld’s attitude, he knew his elder was destined for success, but those ghosts from the netherworld cared nothing for the consequences.

As if sensing his anxiety, the profound pine tree swayed, and a mellow voice resonated from within the thunder.

“The union of Geng and Dui, especially with the art of Present Departs Old, is no great cause for concern. Dui Metal thrives on imperfection; to seek completeness is to court failure. Since ancient times, those who became Great Daoist Masters using five paths of Dui Metal can be counted on one hand. Such a path deviates from the true nature of Dui Metal. It is not a good thing, nor can it lead to the Great Dao. Four parts Dui to one part Geng—that is the true path.”

“If he succeeds in cultivating this path, his Dui Metal will only become more powerful.”

The words flowed like water, allowing the Daoist Master to breathe a little easier. But then, the profound voice echoed once more.

“The True Monarch said: ‘Dui resides in the flawed and the broken. In a weapon, it is the edge. In people, the forgetting of one another. In the earth, defiance of the earth. In autumn, the failure to be autumn. In objects, the will to transform. In the self, the heart that kills… When form scatters, it becomes Ku, the vault. When it projects, it perishes and becomes Geng. When it receives, it conceals and becomes Kui, the Void. When it attains, it fills and becomes Qian, the Heavens.’”

His voice was like the tolling of a great temple bell, shaking the world. The autumn dew fell in sheets, landing as pearls that rolled with a tinkling sound. Like liquid mercury, it seeped into the ground, transmuting malefic qi into precious ore.

Cheng Jiuwen had been blind to what was right before him. Now, it was as if a divine revelation had washed over him, and he suddenly understood.

‘This lord is not just a great cultivator of the Horn Wood Dao with perfected divine abilities! He has listened to the True Monarch’s lectures and studied the Dao at his feet, making him akin to a direct disciple. His mastery of the Dui Metal Dao could be no less profound than his mastery of Horn Wood!’

As if in confirmation, the thunder in the heavens ceased. A desolate autumn wind rolled in, and the very atmosphere began to shift, a silent blessing for the one cultivating within the cave-manse.

“Qian is sublime and boundless, a fullness that matches the heavens. This is ‘harmony’ (Qi). In ancient times, Qian Metal was known as Harmonising Metal. Cultivators use the term ‘Metal’ to signify perfection in their practice, yet the true nature of Metal Virtue does not lean toward completeness. If one must force an association, Harmonising Metal is the more fitting term.”

The spirit pine had cultivated on this mountain for countless ages. Its tone was calm and gentle. First, it had created a phenomenon to aid Lingmei; now, it offered guidance to Cheng Jiuwen. The Daoist Master immediately grew calm, his eyes filled with gratitude.

“Many thanks for your guidance, my lord!”

But the changes were not over. The wondrous, profound sound became the final catalyst for completion. The roiling autumn dew intensified under the night sky, showing no signs of stopping.

All the winds of the world surged into the mountain, turning a pallid white. They drifted past like the waters of a great marsh, causing his robes to flutter. Faintly, he heard a shattering sound from within the stone door, and trickles of sand and dust poured from its fissures.

Creak.

The stone door opened.

Steady footsteps followed. A white-robed figure was slowly revealed, stepping out into the dense, rippling qi of Dui Metal, one step at a time.

Cheng Jiuwen heard not a single word as he slowly raised his head.

The man’s face was utterly serene, a stillness as profound and unnerving as an ancient well. His cheeks were gaunt, though his cheekbones were not prominent. Beneath two eyebrows as sharp as swords was a pair of luminous white, sword-like pupils.

Between his brows rested a single, soybean-sized mark of the purest black, devoid of edge or sharpness.

Under spiritual sense, the four Metal Virtue divine abilities behind this Great Daoist Master blazed like midday suns in the mortal realm, so bright and scorching they seared the eyes. This was the Sword Gate’s first Dui Metal Great Daoist Master in three hundred years: Cheng Xunzhi!

Dui Metal was a prominent Dao in this era, the path of slaughter and destruction, the very essence of Metal Virtue… and Cheng Xunzhi was also a Sword Immortal.

Even if his fourth divine ability was Geng Metal, and even if that divine ability was not yet perfected, for the Sword Gate, a figure of his caliber was second only to their founding patriarch, Cheng Liuxing.

‘Martial Uncle… he succeeded.’

Cheng Jiuwen felt not joy, but a sense of dread. He knelt lower, his eyes red as he choked out the words:

“Congratulations, Martial Uncle!”

The cry seemed to pull the Dui Metal Sword Immortal back to reality. As if waking from a long dream, he looked around, took a step, and appeared beneath the profound pine.

At some point, a golden-hued sword had been placed squarely on the table.

The blade was three chi and eight cun long, simple and unadorned. Its hilt was of pear wood, and the blade itself was snow-white, etched with faint, crack-like patterns of pale gold that resembled pear blossoms.

White Pear.

The sword trembled, emitting a low, weeping hum. As the Dui Metal Sword Immortal quietly lifted it, a piercing, high-pitched sword cry filled the heavens. Streaks of Sword Intent shot like light through the world and purified the cosmos.

“Martial Uncle!”

The sword cry faded. Cheng Jiuwen took a step forward, but the only sound on the mountain was the faint whisper of wind through the trees. After a long moment, a sharp, cold voice, like the grinding of metal, finally spoke,

“Senior, for fifty years you have not answered. I had assumed it was a malady of the Golden Oneness, the great bulwark between Geng and Dui.”

His words, hard as iron and stone, drifted into the dense canopy of pine needles, striking the emerald, white, and gold-tinged branches until they rustled. Cheng Xunzhi stood there for a long time, but he received no reply.

There was only silence.

Cheng Jiuwen knelt for a long while. When he finally looked up, the Dui Metal Sword Immortal was gone. The dense azure light that had enveloped the treetops had also vanished like smoke. Only the layers upon layers of pine needles still stubbornly swayed in the silent night.
