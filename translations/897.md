# Chapter 897: Pushing North

The sword immortal vanished in a streak of light, leaving the others standing alone on the mountain. Kui Qi's voice was heavy with sorrow.

"We respectfully see Master off!"

Everyone bowed as one.

"We respectfully see the Great Daoist Master off!"

'Green Pine Supreme Yang…'

Li Ximing sighed to himself. He didn't know the full depths of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, but their power level was plain to see. With Lou Xing's departure, who among them could ever match the presence of such a sword immortal?

The group resettled. Daoist Master Houfu looked melancholic, busying himself by pulling spirit tea from a storage bag and beginning to brew it.

Daoist Master Kui Qi spoke, his voice grave. "Today, we slew thirteen of the Merciful Ones, while six of them perished. This is a great victory. We have blunted the ferocious advance of the Buddhist cultivators and severed the grasping hand of the Way of Great Desire. By securing our position on Tangdao Mountain, we can now consolidate our efforts."

Hearing this, Tinglan spoke softly. "The Way of Emptiness was already weak. That one Dharma Master transcended his self-attachment all at once, refusing to preserve even a single mote of his True Spirit. There has been no word of him since. That event caused the simultaneous fall of two Mahas from the Kosa Temple, and the Buddhist Land itself was nearly lost!"

"If the Maha from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm hadn't intervened, 'Emptiness' would be indistinguishable from 'Wrath'. It's a shame the other aspects propped each other up, muddied the waters, and pushed their influence here into Jiangbei."

"A true pity."

As Li Ximing listened to them, Ning Wan interjected.

"Primordial Magnetism is surging on Tangdao Mountain. We must set up an array. It will serve to both gather the mountain's Primordial Magnetism and to defend against the Buddhist cultivators. This mountain seals the pass to the south. With Golden Feather to the west and Chengyun to the east, securing it will make our rear safe."

Ning Wan was the Azure Pond Sect's genius of array daos, and Tinglan also had her own legacy. Kui Qi, who was in charge, was also well-researched in arrays. This point should have been an early consensus. Kui Qi nodded.

"That makes sense. We don't need to overdo it. A temporary main array with ten or twenty sub-arrays will cover the mountain tightly. There's just one problem."

He looked up, his expression turning serious and troubled. "We don't need to design a special formation for this mountain; it would take three to five years to complete. We can just build a few array nodes and deploy the Purple Mansion Realm array disks I have stored at Xiukui."

"The three of us are more than enough to handle it. However, given Tangdao Mountain's spiritual veins, only Primordial Lightning is truly suitable. Other Daoist traditions would be easier, but the Three Lightning Dao... it descends from the Northern Palace and is part of Encompassing Profoundity. We are completely ignorant of it."

"And where can one even find a respectable Primordial Lightning Daoist tradition today?"

Tinglan replied, "Since it's a Daoist tradition of Encompassing Profoundity, we should inquire with the Northern Sea. The Lightning Dao may be obscure, but the Xie family and the North Ring Sect still exist... Furthermore... could we perhaps ask Mount Changhuai and the True Dao Unification Gate?"

Mount Changhuai in the Wu State was one thing, but the True Dao Unification Gate was the sect established at Azure Jade Cliff by Nian Yi, a disciple of the Yue Cultivating Sect who had inherited True Monarch Shangyuan's Daoist tradition. Hearing this, Kui Qi's expression turned grim.

"We can ask," he cautioned, "but don't count on it. We'd best prepare to use my Xiukui's Black Wave Piercing Sea Spirit Array. Borrowing what we need won't be easy this time."

The other two fell silent. Tinglan quickly shook her head and changed the subject.

"Then there's the Sacred Writ Gate. Zhu Gong is severely wounded and has vanished. Her subordinates are fighting uncontrollably. I sent someone with orders to make them stop, but the situation is still a complete mess."

At the mention of Zhu Gong, Kui Qi sighed with a trace of helplessness.

"She left the moment my back was turned. She clearly doesn't trust me. Try to use whatever profound abilities you have to contact her. Tell her to come back. Whether it's Zhaojing's alchemy or our own Daoist scriptures, anything we can offer is better than her struggling alone in the Eastern Sea."

With the discussion settled, Tinglan bowed.

"Qiuhu and I will head into the mountains first. We'll survey the terrain and spiritual veins, and also stand watch in case anyone with ill intentions tries to tamper with the area."

"Go," Kui Qi said, dismissing them.

The wind and snow on the summit intensified. Li Ximing, having waited patiently, finally found his chance to speak.

He sighed. "I've been entangled in so many matters recently... I was hoping to ask about..."

Kui Qi, of course, knew what he wanted to ask. He waved his hand dismissively.

"You're asking about the spirit embryo. I've already given it some thought. I also saw your Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire. I recognized it at a glance as something from the Comprehending Profoundity dao. In artifact refinement, that path often seeks external spiritual items and the nourishment of others' dharma power to rapidly forge an artifact."

"Our Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, however, does not use such spell arts for refinement. We have no fondness for sacrificial methods. We rely on internal refinement and nourishment from our own divine abilities. Even the spirit embryos of the Upper Shaman dao are typically forged by a cultivator using their own abilities."

'So Changxi's Daoist tradition truly does stem from Comprehending Profoundity…'

Li Ximing bowed. "It was my oversight..."

But Kui Qi shook his head.

"It's not a problem. I know you're refining this spirit embryo for Dilu Tian Sanglin of the Southern Songzhou Luoshe. I'm not sure which of his descendants it's for... In any case, I remember there is a Daoist Master in Qize who cultivates the Upper Shaman path. He can refine it for you."

Daoist Master Kui Qi was clearly being very helpful. Li Ximing was overjoyed and was about to offer his thanks, but the Daoist Master held up a hand and smiled.

"Don't thank me yet. I want to discuss this matter with you."

"The Buddhist cultivators to the north have not given up their ambitions. This Daoist Master from Qize possesses rare skills, but he refuses to get involved, making it difficult to secure his help. When he comes to the lake, you should arrange for him to visit Mount Wu. If the discussion goes well, you can then try asking him. Persuading him would be the ideal outcome."

"After all, this doesn't concern just one family."

Li Ximing nodded, realizing the implication. 'He suspects that because my family occupied Mount Wu so early, we might have discovered some powerful shamanic artifacts or legacies within the ruins. Something that could be used to move this Daoist Master.'

He agreed to the arrangement, but sighed. "The only issue is that when my family occupied Mount Wu, it was already a desolate ruin. It had been picked clean by countless Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. I fear there is nothing impressive left to show him."

The two exchanged a few more pleasantries before Kui Qi gestured to the tea, politely dismissing him. Only after Li Ximing transformed into a ray of light and departed did Daoist Master Houfu speak.

"The Li family is a mortal enemy of the Buddhist cultivators. At this critical moment, they fear a southern push far more than we do."

Kui Qi nodded. "Exactly. That's why I pulled him in early. Whether it was the matter of the Sichuan or this great array, we're looking out for him. By helping him succeed, we distribute the pressure from the Buddhist cultivators. It's not every day you find a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who is wholeheartedly on your side. We can't just let him perish. As for the Li Zhouwei situation... we'll adapt as it develops."

He brushed that matter aside. With Li Ximing gone, there were things they could finally discuss. A look of cold resentment crossed his face.

"In the end," he said in a low voice, "the Grotto-Heaven never descended. In years past, when the Great One made a move, even the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven couldn't resist. And now? Secret Diffusion didn't even open!"

Kui Qi's voice grew sharp and cold. "Have we ever been greedy enough to ask for Wanling Heaven? But Secret Diffusion is different! It's a Mystic Realm! A Mystic Realm listed in the Seventy-Two Grotto-Profoundity Scrolls! The mountain itself was a gift from Wei! The original master of Secret Diffusion of the Seventy-Two Grottoes was named Li! And they dare claim there's no trace of the scroll? That the Mystic Realm won't open?! This is utterly humiliating!"

A cold glint flashed in his eyes as he raged. "So they sent the token over early, deliberately opened the gate, and then, while 'stabilizing' the Grotto-Heaven, they condescended to toss down three or five swords and a dozen dharma artifacts. Then they immediately kicked everyone out! No trace of the Treasure Rhyme Gourd! The Sui Gengchen is in the Great One's sea of qi! And not a single clue about the Stargazing Bronze Sparrow! After a full search, not even one Mihua Spirit Elixir was found! Good. *Good.* Their desire to humiliate our Supreme Yang is painfully obvious!"

Houfu had obviously been suppressing his own rage. His expression darkened as he spoke, his voice cold.

"It's true. What happened in Anhuai Heaven, with its Metallic Essence, was chaotic but perhaps understandable. But they started their scheming back during the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven! The Elucidation of Chongyuan's Supplemental Law vanished. The Supreme Yang Glazed Pagoda was snatched away, leaving behind a mere ritual vessel. If Senior Yuanxiu hadn't been so profound, we would have lost the Huai River Map in Anhuai Heaven as well!"

"And even before that! They claimed Guo E killed the Tang family. How could he possibly have done it? It was all for the Sun Seeker Ring! In the old days, with several Great Daoist Masters present, they never went too far. Now, they are utterly shameless!"

After they spoke, the long-suppressed anger vented, but they still had to face reality. Kui Qi remained silent. Houfu turned and sipped his tea.

'And what if it is?…'

Houfu looked out at the suddenly empty courtyard. "Martial Uncle, the courtyard is certainly peaceful now."

The Great Xiukui Monastery had a tradition of "hard labor." Based on the principles of embracing nature and understanding mortal life, it was the one arduous duty required of all cultivators. Every few years, they had to perform this labor, a testament to the sect's ideal of seclusion and detachment from worldly affairs.

When his Martial Uncle Kui Qi took charge of the sect, he changed the location. He gathered all the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators obligated to perform this duty and had them tend to tea fields and farms on the mountain summit, all with great fanfare.

Others didn't understand, but Houfu knew his Martial Uncle's intent. It was simply to show the Great Daoist Master how this rule wore down the cultivators, all in the hopes of having it changed.

Now, the sword immortal had brushed them all away with a sleeve and departed, leaving a perfect opportunity to change the ancestral rules.

"It should have been changed long ago," Kui Qi said. "It's nothing but a waste of cultivation time. You and I both went through it. Farming is just farming. Those who can find enlightenment in it would find it anyway. As for those who can't, you could make them farm the entirety of Tiger's Frontier and it would be useless."

Houfu savored his tea, finally daring to speak. "Martial Uncle," he ventured, "the Great Daoist Master may not have liked your intentions, but he understood them. It's just... I haven't been back in a while. About the Lingu family..."

Kui Qi said nothing, remaining silent for a long moment. At last, he spoke. "It's not proper to discuss. Go... go ask the Northern Sea."

...

Jiangbei.

Li Ximing crossed from the riverbank and headed north. He passed Baiye Creek and saw that the Baijiang Creek area was orderly and well-demarcated. Li Jiangxia was descending on a ray of Heavenly Light to greet him.

At his side, a half-step behind, was the dao-robed Guan Gongxiao, following respectfully. On the other side, Ding Weizeng clutched his weapon, clearly out of place with the Capital immortals Dao cultivators. His expression was stiff, only softening when he saw Li Ximing.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master," Li Jiangxia said. "The three Secret Diffusion territories have been pacified. The various cultivators have been driven off, and the local families have submitted. Only the Wang clan members have gathered north of Fanyun, with Chengyun at their backs. We have not sent anyone to engage them."

"Hn."

With the Li family's current power, it would have been strange if Li Jiangxia *hadn't* been able to pacify the White River area instantly. From the current arrangement, it was clear the Capital immortals Dao hadn't dared to claim a single scrap of land, yielding everything.

Li Ximing descended as Li Jiangxia continued his report.

"The various Daoist Masters and Buddhist cultivators who intervened captured many people. The local powers are terrified. As for the remnants of the Hall of the Locust Soul, they have all but vanished. Only a few who were sheltering under Xiao Yuan remain, and we've gathered them on the mountain."

"I was concerned there might be close confidants of Xiao Yuan among them, so I have not been overly harsh. I've sent a few people to question them. We should have clarity in two or three days."

Li Ximing listened impassively. "What of Wang Quwan?"

Li Jiangxia lowered his gaze. "He and Wang Xiaoxiao were taken to Chengyun Gate and have not yet returned. Wang Quyu sent a letter. It's clear he's in a difficult position, but the letter is still filled with empty pleasantries."

He held the letter up with both hands. Li Ximing merely glanced at it, not bothering to read it. Since his family members had already entered another's sect, Li Ximing naturally wouldn't trouble them further.

"Send a reply. Tell him there is no need to write again."

"Yes, sir."

The man immediately retracted the letter. Guan Gongxiao, standing to the side, bowed respectfully.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master... all cultivators of Capital immortals Dao are present and await your orders."

Guan Gongxiao's feelings were undoubtedly complex, even bewildered, but Li Ximing paid him no mind.

"We have pacified Tangdao Mountain," Li Ximing said lightly. "The Buddhist cultivators will not let this go easily. We will have to hold it for some time."

"If this mountain is breached, we will be forced to retreat to the riverbank. The other families have Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to protect them; their fate is unknown. But your Daoist Master is not present. Your Capital immortals Dao will be the first to be annihilated."

Guan Gongxiao broke into a cold sweat and bowed deeply. "Capital immortals Dao would not dare to do anything but serve you to the death!"

Li Ximing waved his hand, dismissing him.

Once the Capital immortals Dao's sect master had flown off, Li Jiangxia lowered his voice.

"Daoist Master, we also found two or three... dharma artifacts... but they had already fallen into the hands of rogue cultivators and local clan cultivators. These people did not flee; they remained in the mountains and came to pay their respects the moment our men arrived. We found quite a few cultivation manuals, but we are still tracing their origins. We only have one manual in hand that is worthy of your attention."

"They are clever, at least," Li Ximing noted.

Li Jiangxia pressed on. "My thought was... we should not pursue the matter of one or two dharma artifacts. We can use this to demonstrate our family's impartiality."

Li Ximing recognized that Li Jiangxia was likely seeking his confirmation before reporting back to Li Jianglong on the island. He saw through it but simply gestured for Li Jiangxia to handle it himself.

"Where are Li Quantao's people?" Li Ximing asked, changing the subject. "And that group of Secret Diffusion remnants, the cultivators who were released into Jiangbei?"

Li Jiangxia replied respectfully, "Li Quantao and his son were urgently recalled to the Azure Pond Sect... we have no news. Fei Tonglu and Fei Tongcai have vanished, perhaps taken by someone during the chaos. As for the few who walked right into our net by returning to Jiangbei... most were killed by the local clans. We have located two survivors and brought them here."

His expression turned strange. "It is said... these two are no longer who they were."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. He saw the old man, Qu Bushi, escorting a man and a woman forward. They were dressed differently from Jiangbei cultivators. The man's eyes were wide with fury, and the woman's face was etched with resentment.

'I can tell with a single glance they've been influenced by a True Monarch. They must have met him long ago. No wonder Jiangxia didn't dare to handle this.'

After so many incidents in the north, Li Ximing had gained experience. This was why True Monarchs were more terrifying to those at the Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining stages—their minds could be subtly influenced. By the Foundation Establishment Realm and Purple Mansion Realm, while still terrifying, they wouldn't just casually seize control of one's mind.

The moment the seal on the man's mouth was released, he began to scream, "Lord Lin is the reincarnation of Secret Diffusion's True Monarch! How dare you! All the clans in this land are protected by the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition! You actually crossed the river... Shameless! Utterly shameless!"

No one on site paid the man any attention. Li Jiangxia respectfully offered a jade slip. Li Ximing scanned it with his spiritual sense and saw three words:

"Feathered Adept's Chant."

This was indeed the Feathered Adept's Chant from the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition. He had obtained half a copy from Wenhu years ago; this one was complete, from beginning to end, without a single omission.

'The Great One's legacy is rich indeed.'

This protective manual, The Feathered Adept's Chant, was at least 5th-Grade. It was undoubtedly a significant gain, the kind of benefit one gets from seizing territory. Others couldn't take away these scattered things. But this was likely all there was.

Only the man was still screaming, an image of unyielding loyalty.

Li Ximing swept his gaze over him. The man's talent wasn't bad; he was already at the ninth level of Qi Refining, a step away from the Foundation Establishment Realm. Before Li Ximing could react, the man cursed again.

"And you, Li Zhaojing! Unworthy of the title Daoist Ma—"

He didn't know Li Ximing's True Name, so he used his Daoist title. The moment he spoke, the faces of everyone present changed. Li Jiangxia was shocked and furious. Qu Bushi looked like his very soul was about to scatter. But before the "Master" could even leave his lips, the man's entire body flashed white-hot. Like a scrap of cloth, he exploded into a cloud of Heavenly Light.

*Bang!*

The man was annihilated on the spot. The woman's face turned ashen. Before she could even open her mouth, she dissolved from head to toe into mist, joining her companion in death. Everyone present dropped to their knees in terror, begging for forgiveness.

Li Ximing was unconcerned. He put away *Feathered Adept's Chant*. The Daoist Masters who had plundered the area had taken anything good. The fact these two were left behind spoke to their quality. They hated his family with a passion and were doomed to die. A death at his hands was a quick release.

"Thoroughly investigate all the cultivation manuals scattered in this territory. I am heading north."

He waved them away, stepped into the light, and soared toward Tangdao Mountain.

He arrived to find the mountain covered in heavy snow. The ruined walls had been mostly torn down, revealing bare slopes dotted with cultivators flying back and forth.

But looking around, there were not many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the green robes of the Azure Pond Sect. The majority were the purple-robed disciples of the Purple Smoke Gate, many of whom he recognized from his visit there years ago.

'The Azure Pond Sect suffered a grievous blow. They are clearly still far from recovered.'

He swept his gaze across the scene, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. He stepped through the air and materialized beside a woman in red.

It was Li Minggong. She had already reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Dressed in a red skirt, she stood atop a column of flame, apparently using a spell art to manage the fire. Seeing Li Ximing, she quickly bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow, noting her consolidated cultivation and the natural aura of her abilities. She had clearly benefited greatly. "Good... That spirit pill was not wasted."

Li Minggong bowed again. "I just emerged from seclusion when I encountered two Daoist Masters passing over the lake. They ordered my family's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to bring people here, but our forces are in Jiangbei. As my cultivation is the highest, I came ahead on my fire and brought a few people."

Li Ximing nodded, offered a word of praise, and vanished in a streak of light.

He reappeared before Tinglan, who was riding in the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion suspended in mid-air. He wasn't sure if this was her true body. She stood upon a cloud of Purple Qi, the Supreme Minister's Gourd hanging from her waist, looking simple and unadorned.

Li Ximing had not sought her out without reason. As the pressure from the northern Buddhist cultivators mounted, he grew increasingly anxious. He had set his sights on her 'World's Radiance'.

Whether he could even transcend the Purple Mystery was unknown, but he knew his next two divine abilities had to be the Body Divine Ability and the Life Divine Ability. It was just a question of which came first.

'If the day comes when Jiangbei can no longer be defended and the Buddhist cultivators pour south, survival will be all that matters! It will be hard enough to protect my own life, let alone the lives of the children in my family!'

His own close-combat abilities were already formidable. With the Life Divine Ability in hand, his own survivability—and that of his clan's disciples—would take a qualitative leap. With the Buddhist cultivators looming, Li Ximing had to prepare for the worst.

As for Tinglan's advice to cultivate his second divine ability before tackling the Life Divine Ability, Li Ximing had guessed from her hints that it was likely related to the stability of his mind. Since he possessed the Talisman Seed, he naturally had an extra layer of protection.

Seeing Li Ximing, Tinglan smiled. "Zhaojing, your cultivation... it has truly progressed immensely..."

Li Ximing laughed and demurred. "It's been too long, Daoist Friend. How are your injuries?"

"I still have some time to endure," Tinglan replied, her expression dimming. "I was nurturing an immortal foundation within my sea of qi," she said softly. "After this incident, I must cultivate it all over again. But that's secondary. My 'Purple Qi' dharma body is difficult to nourish. Damaging it is a grievous blow to my vital energy."

"If there are any medicinal pills you need, please don't hesitate to ask me."

Li Ximing offered some words of comfort, then adopted a worried expression. Tinglan noticed his unease.

"What is troubling you?"

He sighed. "I was planning to continue refining a divine ability, but after hearing your words, I've grown concerned. After all, a great battle with the northern Buddhist cultivators is inevitable. That Body Divine Ability I'm working on... I only have a single wisp of its qi left. If I'm injured in the coming battle and have to start cultivating it all over again, it would be a terrible setback."

Li Ximing's worry seemed well-founded, and Tinglan nodded. He continued, "That's when I remembered your sect's 'World's Radiance'. How does one gather the qi for it? If it's more convenient than my current path, that would be for the best."

Tinglan's expression was complicated. "It is certainly much more convenient," she said softly. "Our Purple Smoke Gate has a stockpile of the Luminous Heart Origin Qi required. It isn't difficult to collect, and almost no one in the sect cultivates it. I... I can give it to you."

Li Ximing immediately waved his hands in refusal.

"I cannot accept a reward I have not earned. This is a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation art, and a Life Divine Ability that continues a Daoist tradition at that. There is no reason for me to receive it for free."

Seeing her hesitation, Li Ximing pressed gently, "I only have one question. When I asked you before, you told me to complete my Body Divine Ability before cultivating this one. What was the reason for that?"

Tinglan replied, "It's not a strict limitation. It's just... this Life Divine Ability is somewhat unorthodox. I was hoping you would refine more abilities, grow older, and gain a more profound mastery over your powers. Cultivating it then would be better."

"Secondly... I visited the Great Daoist Master back then and specifically asked about this. His cultivation is profound, and he resolved my doubts... He said that 'World's Radiance' should come at the *end* of all Bright Yang techniques. It is the pinnacle of the Bright Yang path, the final divine ability one should use to seek Fruition Attainment. Cultivating it at any other stage... simply does not provide the same immense benefit to one's Golden Core."

When Li Ximing heard this, he was overjoyed. Why would he fear such a thing, so long as there was no cultivation conflict or negative impact on his next divine ability?

'In any case, there is no way I am saving 'World's Radiance' for last. These three abilities are set in stone. This is just a reminder for Zhouwei. As for whether he confronts... how he handles the matter of Emperor Wei... that is all up to him.'

He laughed heartily and shook his head.

"I have no such lofty ambitions! In all of Jiangnan, how many truly aim for the Golden Core? I just want to protect my life and save my family!"
