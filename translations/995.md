# Chapter 995: Formation Cultivation

Hearing this, Li Ximing sat up a little straighter. He looked at the boy, who was merely at the Embyronic Breathing realm, and smiled.

"Oh?"

Li Suining raised his brows and bowed. "Reporting to the Daoist Master: formation flags are the foundation for setting up a formation, but they are not the key to learning formations. If the inscribed formation patterns are accurate and logical, infusing them with dharma power will also reveal a complete and harmonious resonance... This can be used to verify what one has learned."

Li Ximing was not skilled in formations, but with his high Dao-Profundity, he naturally understood the boy's words with ease.

Formation flags were not only the critical nodes of a grand formation but also its most crucial hubs. Even with a minimum of six flags, one could use dharma power to probe for problems in the patterns and complete the inscription. However, even without flags, if the formation was inscribed to perfection from the start, it would naturally exhibit a unique resonance when stimulated by dharma power.

This principle was remarkably similar to how Li Xuanxuan used to practice drawing talismans by diluting spiritual ink with water during the Li family's poorer, early years. But the Dao of formations was not like the Dao of talismans. The formation eyes, patterns, base, and platform had to correspond to the interplay of Daoist Traditions above and align with the spiritual opportunity of the earth veins below. At advanced levels, it even touched upon the hidden secrets of ancient prosperity and decline. The precise sequence and staggering of the inscriptions were immensely complex, and a single attempt could take ten days to half a month.

Therefore, among all the arts, talismans were the cheapest, used by commoners and rogue cultivators. Alchemy was the most expensive, favored by newly risen great families. Artifact refining prioritized Dao Lineage and was often passed down by an elder. The Dao of formations, however, required deep Dao-Profundity and was typically only cultivated by immortal sects.

Without flags, hundreds or thousands of errors could be clustered together. Even if you knew something was wrong, you wouldn't know where the error was. If he wasn't a genius, how could he possess such an ability?

He merely nodded with intrigued interest, a pleased look on his face. He glanced at the relieved Li Jiangzong and said, "Go and bring the Long-Radiance Star-Shroud Flags."

Li Jiangzong quickly agreed and went down personally. Li Ximing smiled. "A Comprehensive Guide to the Dao of Formations... which Daoist tradition does it belong to?"

Li Minggong took a step forward and spoke in a gentle voice, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, the family's formations are managed by Guest Retainer Huang from Jiangbei. Some years ago, he was ordered to collect the family's many formation fragments and compiled them into A Comprehensive Guide to the Dao of Formations. It has nine volumes in total. Jiangwu and the others have all taken the first three volumes back with them."

Li Ximing nodded and asked, "Is he still managing the family's formations now?"

Li Minggong quickly shook her head and said respectfully, "Five years ago... Guest Retainer Huang failed his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm... and perished. The dao inheritance of formations is currently managed by Steward Tian Ling and the master of the Precious Array Pavilion, He Junxiu. Their skills in formations are acceptable, but they do not compare to Guest Retainer Huang..."

Li Ximing shook his head inwardly, knowing that the family's dao inheritance of formations had truly fallen into decline.

Li Suining listened to the names, finding them all very familiar. He knew Old Tian (Tian Ling) and Pavilion Master He well in his previous life. After Li Ximing brought back the inheritance of Daoist Master Yuanbian, Li Suining and Pu Xinya took over the Precious Array Pavilion, but these two elders still handled many of the miscellaneous tasks.

Later, after Tingzhou was conquered and enfeoffed, he heard news of this Pavilion Master He even in the Southern Borderlands. The He family had been granted the Western Ting Prefecture, and this Pavilion Master He had become a Family Head himself.

He held no resentment over this; instead, he felt a sense of calm acceptance. After all, the tides of fate were vast, and few could remain untouched. The He family had originally been the local tyrants of the west bank. Their power was curtailed under the Li family's rule, but they had remained law-abiding and fulfilled all their duties. He didn't end up like Tian Ling, who committed suicide in front of the pavilion. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, it was normal for him to surrender.

In the span of that thought, Li Jiangzong had already returned from outside the hall. He held a jade box the color of emerald. The lid was open, revealing twelve formation flags resting inside. They had a purple base adorned with star-like patterns and radiated a gentle glow.

The Long-Radiance Star-Shroud Flags!

Li Ximing smiled. "These Long-Radiance Star-Shroud Flags were a congratulatory gift from Quan Yuduan, the disciple of brother Xizhi... from back when Minghuang achieved the Purple Mansion Realm. Although they are only twelve Qi Refining flags, they are quite unique, not inferior to an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact. It was a kind gesture from him, but they were stored away in the clan and never put to use."

Li Suining was overjoyed. He quickly bowed low and said respectfully, "I will definitely not fail the Daoist Master's trust!"

Inwardly, he was thrilled. 'I've truly earned his regard!'

He knew that in his past life, Li Suining had never reached the point of being personally gifted formation flags by the Daoist Master. The two brothers had only received a few words of encouragement and were given dharma artifacts and resources from the clan... While also generous, it was far from the significance of the Long-Radiance Star-Shroud Flags!

Although the Long-Radiance Star-Shroud Flags eventually became his anyway... that didn't happen until he was in the mid-stage of Qi Refining and had begun to distinguish himself, by which time Yang Zhuo had already been enthroned for five years!

'It's just a pity... I'll have to wait until Daoist Master Zhaojing returns from the Eastern Sea and the family obtains the Sutra of Profound Iteration. Only then can I openly use the two auxiliary formations, Profound-Gathering and Treasure-Suspension, for my cultivation...'

While he was calculating in his mind, Li Ximing, having resolved a long-standing concern, was in a rare good mood. He beamed at the boy, finding the familiar, sharp aura between his brows more and more pleasing. He unexpectedly asked, "Do you have any thoughts? What are your aspirations for your cultivation?"

He was asking about his future divine ability and Dao Lineage!

Not only was Li Jiangzong slightly astonished, but Li Minggong was also both shocked and delighted. Even Li Suining himself was stunned for a moment!

One had to understand that one's immortal foundation and divine ability determined their future Dao path. Countless people in the family had stagnated because of this. Whether it was Li Minggong or, later, Li Zhouda, or even Ding Weizeng—the Palace-Yang Tiger who had never made a name for himself in the Great Song, much to Li Ximing's later regret—they all suffered from the same problem: a discontinued Dao Lineage.

To be asked this now was an excellent opportunity! The family's well-known Dao Lineages, like the Bright Yang Celestial Gate and the Dao of the Perilous Tread, were all lineages with a clear path to the Purple Mansion Realm. Because of his past life's memories, Li Suining was very familiar with the family's lineages. Besides Li Fire and Whole Pill, there was even the Lesser Yin Purple Mansion Dao.

But he did not ask for any of them. He bowed respectfully and replied, "This junior does not have a specific Dao Lineage in mind. But since I am cultivating the Dao of formations, my only desire is to establish a dao inheritance of formations for the family. I hope to cultivate Dao Lineage methods that aid the Dao of formations... As for the rest... I have no other requests!"

This was the truth. Bright Yang was definitely not suitable for him to cultivate again; even if he wanted to, Li Ximing would likely not grant it to him now. As for Li Fire and Whole Pill, neither was what he sought. The one he truly desired in his heart was a Heaven–Governing cultivation art called the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court.

In his past life, he entered the Milin Mountains, selected a cultivation art in the mountain's Dao palace, and later entered the island's secret hall. He deliberated for a long time, torn between the Celestial-Awakening Ear from the Art of the Watchful Awakening Star and the Profound Dipper's Balance from the Art of the Golden Tablet... In the end, he chose the Art of the Golden Tablet...

Later, the family obtained the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court, which shared the same origin as the Art of the Golden Tablet, and his Dao path advanced from then on. Unfortunately, he had already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm by then, and his immortal foundation was ultimately a step behind.

Now, he remembered this scroll by heart, but he dared not use it, which was a vexing problem.

But regardless of the future, his current answer was excellent. Above him, Li Ximing heard his words, raised an eyebrow, and nodded in satisfaction, smiling.

"Good!"

He seemed about to say more, but his expression suddenly changed. He hastily set down his tea, shot a quick glance aside, and said, "It's rare for the family to produce a formation genius. I will remember your name!"

He said that one sentence, and there was nothing more. Li Ximing looked up, and without time for another word of instruction, he dissolved into light and vanished. This made Li Suining's heart tighten...

With the painful lessons of his previous life, even at his most triumphant moments, Li Suining always felt a precarious sense of danger, as if walking on thin ice. He felt a hidden unease. 'He must have urgent business... I just hope nothing terrible has happened!'

As soon as the Daoist Master left, the atmosphere in the hall relaxed. Li Jiangzong finally began the tedious tasks of compiling the register, calling the roll for the incense rites, and arranging the ancestral worship lines. Nearby, Li Minggong smiled and withdrew his gaze, looking over at Li Zhouxun on the other side. He saw the perennially silent, middle-aged man nod. "A clever child."

Although a Purple Mansion Realm inheritance wasn't something one could get just by asking, and while Li Suining had seemingly missed his chance, he would have opportunities in the future. But receiving a single "Good!" from Li Ximing was enough to guarantee him a place on the island—one had to know that even Li Zhouda, who was currently in the limelight... had never received such praise!

The two of them patiently watched the juniors below, carefully appraising each one. Seemingly satisfied, they soon left one after the other. But the ceremony in the hall had only just begun. It wasn't until four hours later, after the bell had rung three times, that Li Jiangzong breathed a sigh of relief. He finished arranging the clan's affairs and dismissed the children.

The group of children was mostly dazed and anxious; the younger ones had been standing so long their legs had turned to jelly. Li Suining simply led his younger brother away, whispering, "This is just the beginning. Our residence is the Bailian Pavilion at West Seventh Pillar. In three days, there's another clan event. All the elders and the old masters will be there. You must prepare well..."

In truth, the event in three days was the important one. Li Xuanxuan had always made a point of questioning each child individually. It was only Li Ximing's appearance today that made this preliminary ritual seem so unique.

Li Suining escorted his brother all the way back to the pavilion. After closing the door, he showed no intention of resting and immediately headed down from the attic room.

'The clan's medicinal pills will be granted soon, and I'll be qualified to assail the Qi Refining realm. I'll have to come to the island again then, which will waste several more days. I might as well use these three days... to go to the main hall and make my selection!'

He secretly reviewed his own words, thinking carefully. 'It's a good thing... the Daoist Master hasn't achieved the World's Radiance yet, so I can still have some small schemes in his presence. But... his aura is still incredibly powerful...'

As he mused, the image of Li Ximing rising in a hurry couldn't help but reappear in his mind, filling him with dread. 'Impossible... it can't be... It shouldn't be this early...'

... ...

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Li Ximing hurriedly materialized in a flash of light, stopping amidst the mountains. He immediately spotted the young man sitting at a table with a smile. He strode forward in just a few steps, exclaiming joyfully, "Minghuang, you've come out of seclusion!"

The golden-eyed young man at the table saw him, and the contemplative look on his face quickly faded, replaced by a smile. He rose quickly. "Greetings, Grand-Uncle!"

"Alright, alright..." The Daoist Master simply pulled the young man down to sit, began to brew tea for him, and laughed. "Do you have good news to share? If you don't, I certainly do!"

Li Zhouwei chuckled, his mood instantly lightening. "I was in seclusion healing my wounds, what good news could I have? I just borrowed the omen of success from Sovereign's Perilous Tread and the Pure Qi efficacy of the Profound Vastness Art to spend the last year and a half healing... I really should thank those two barbarians from the Xiangli family. With the aid from the Perilous Tread's success, I was saved a lot of time."

"The rest of the time... I refined my divine abilities and studied spell arts. Hardly counts as good news."

But Li Ximing laughed. He first took an item from his sleeve. It was round, like a Golden Core—it was the Spiritual Treasure, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument!

He introduced the Spiritual Treasure's many functions and passed it to Li Zhouwei. The young man accepted it and began to carefully read the Southern Li Ingestion Method contained within. After a long moment, a look of amazement crossed his face. "What a powerful Daoist text! If I cultivated Li Fire, reading this would be immensely beneficial!"

Li Ximing replied, "I copied a portion and sent it to Li Jiangqian's immortal abode. I also took advantage of a gap in news two years ago to ask about his progress. He has already finished cultivating the first secret art, Double Fire, and has begun the second, Heavenly Apricot."

Li Zhouwei was still very concerned about Li Jiangqian's progress. He nodded at the news but was noncommittal about the use of the Southern Li Ingestion Method. "For him to use the Southern Li Ingestion Method, he'd need to be at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm at minimum. It's useless for him to read it now. He's smart; he'll glance at it and not waste any more time. ...How is Que'Wan?"

Li Ximing grew serious. "She is at the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, with Senior Changdie watching over her. News came some time ago. She has refined her cultivation and is working on the first secret art, Material Transformation. The Golden Book of Divine Attendance is extremely difficult, so it's perfectly normal for her progress to be a step slower."

"They are all striving hard." The golden-eyed young man nodded. He then watched Li Ximing take two remaining Spiritual Artifacts from his sleeve and line them up on the table. He presented a purplish-gold thunder mace that flickered with violet-white electricity. "I've refined these Spiritual Artifacts over the past few days. This Demonbane Cleaver Mace is the most powerful!"

Li Zhouwei's eyes lit up. He took it as Li Ximing explained, "This mace commands thunder, suppresses and kills evil Demons, and has the effect of discerning ghosts and wickedness. It's a first-class offensive weapon... It's just a pity that the Demonbane Cleaver Mace favors wielders of Profound Thunder, and we don't cultivate Profound Thunder... Otherwise, with this weapon in hand, its might would be vastly greater!"

Li Zhouwei turned it over in his hands. It was heavy. "That's natural... Profound Thunder oversees the world. This fits the methods of the Thunder Palace."

As he communicated with it using his spiritual sense, Li Ximing introduced it from the side. "Exactly. This item has three divine abilities. The first is Thunder's Vigil. Once you wield this item and activate the ability, it will call down lightning in a hundred-mile radius... Even without a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator powering it, it still has considerable might, similar to the Huai River Map from back then, but more ferocious. It's suitable for guarding a region..."

"The second is Thunder-Quell. The Demonbane Cleaver Mace contains a secret light of heavenly thunder, which has a pulverizing effect. There are three levels in total. I've already tested it. If all three levels are unleashed, it can shatter the vast majority of spell lights and divine abilities."

"The third is more peculiar, called Cloud-Patrol. It has the ability to move with light and thunder, allowing it to accumulate thunderclouds in the sky. It gathers power bit by bit over time, with a three-day limit, to produce a single bolt of punitive lightning. The might is considerable... More importantly... if it strikes someone directly... it inflicts an overwhelming, unbearable pain that lingers for a very long time..."

After saying this, his expression turned slightly odd. He continued, "It's a good tool for ambushing someone. But in my opinion, it probably wasn't created to ambush anyone. Spiritual Artifacts often display greater power in the hands of people from the same Dao path and Dao Lineage. To me... this seems like a divine ability used for punishment..."

"That's not wrong," Li Zhouwei said thoughtfully. "Indeed, these three abilities are mostly supportive... Its primary power as a mace isn't fully displayed. The Demonbane Cleaver Mace... just from the 'cleaver' part of its name, it should have a divine ability specific to its Dao Lineage... We'll just have to see if our family's descendants have the good fortune to discover it."

His eyes brightened slightly. As he nodded, he infused his divine ability and dharma power into it. A seal-script character appeared on the hilt:

"Huan."
