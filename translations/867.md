# Chapter 867: Zhaoguang Xuanzi

Time flowed by on the lake. Li Ximing was merely refining his Divine Abilities, but the hours passed in a flash. When he opened his eyes, Li Jiangqian was already standing in the mountain clearing, his voice respectful.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, the esteemed seniors have arrived together. They are waiting on the island and request your presence."

Li Ximing knew this meant Kui Qi and the others had returned. Beside him, Ning Wan opened her eyes at the same moment. Her expression was gentle as she spoke to him.

"Your clan's upbringing is quite remarkable. The so-called righteous path… it must begin with an upright body before it can lead to an upright heart."

It was only then that Li Ximing remembered Daoist Master Qiuhu cultivated the Serene Listen ability, a Life Divine Ability of Cold Qi. She must not have heard a single disrespectful thought from Li Jiangqian to offer such a compliment. 'But who knows if the Talisman Seed played a part in that?' he thought, not daring to mention it.

He quickly smiled and said, "You flatter me. We shouldn't keep the two seniors waiting."

The two of them transformed, one into a flash of bright light, the other into a swirl of cold qi, reappearing in the island's main hall in the blink of an eye. The once-empty space now held two figures, both of them at the Purple Mansion Realm.

The man in the lead was, of course, Lingmei, his hair and beard streaked with white. He cradled a snow-white spirit sword in his arms as if it were the most precious of treasures. A faint smile touched his lips, his aura was steady, and his Daoist robes flowed as he spoke.

Behind him stood Daoist Master Kui Qi, dressed all in black, nodding slightly. The black cord they had seen before was now tied around his waist. Had one not witnessed the spiritual artifact in action, it would be impossible to guess it was such a precious treasure.

With the arrival of Li Ximing and Ning Wan, the small Pingya Island now hosted four Daoist Masters.

Seeing Li Ximing, Lingmei smiled. "Zhaojing," he said softly, "it has been a long time."

Li Ximing quickly bowed in respect. "Greetings, Senior. I returned from the Eastern Sea in such a hurry that I haven't had the chance to visit the Sword Gate to express my gratitude. Regarding my kinsman, Zhouwei, my clan is endlessly grateful for your sect's timely rescue. If there is ever anything you need in the future, any pills that require refining, you have only to ask."

"You're too polite," Lingmei said, waving his hand dismissively.

Li Ximing gestured for him to take a seat. Kui Qi, however, spoke with a note of regret. "It's a pity. Zhelu has clearly benefited from his gains over the years. His Divine Abilities have grown more refined. We failed to wound him severely this time, only managing to injure a few of his eyes."

Lingmei stroked his beard and picked up the thread. "Although I wield the Great Snow's Severing Edge, challenging him as a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator was pushing my limits. If Senior Lou Xing had been here, empowered by his Sword Intent and wielding this blade, only then could we have truly inflicted a grievous blow upon that man."

The sword cultivator then raised an eyebrow. "Daoist Master Qiuhu… how is Tinglan?"

Ning Wan gave a brief and concise summary of the situation, which seemed to satisfy Lingmei. Meanwhile, Li Ximing reluctantly fiddled with the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass tucked in his sleeve. It wouldn't do to have them ask for such a valuable item directly; that would be unseemly. He took it out, a smile on his face.

"Now that the matter is settled, this spiritual artifact should be returned to its rightful owner."

As he produced the golden compass, Kui Qi nodded with a smile, accepting it. "Zhaojing, you truly are formidable," he praised. "No wonder you could escape from Changxiao's grasp so calmly. But it was only after witnessing your Bright Yang True Fire execute the Merciful One that I understood the true extent of your power."

Li Ximing replied humbly, "I only had the advantage of the Audience with the Celestial Gate suppressing him. I cannot compare to you two seniors."

Kui Qi shook his head, having already formed his own judgment. "Tinglan will be unable to act for some time," he said, his tone serious. "But the situation in the north still needs to be resolved. That being the case, let us all travel to my Xiukui's Tiger's Frontier Mountain and settle this matter first."

He paused, turning his head slightly toward Li Ximing. "It will also be a good opportunity to give you the pills from our vaults."

Ning Wan took the chance to add, "Speaking of which, Sister Tinglan had promised to help the Li clan construct a Purple Mansion Grand Array. The foundations were just laid when this incident interrupted everything. Before she returned to her sect, she entrusted this task to me. Moongaze Lake is near Jiangbei, so this is an urgent matter. I lack the strength to complete it on my own… I was hoping you might take a look, Senior."

"Oh?" Kui Qi chuckled upon hearing this and shook his head. "Of course. We've just returned from a trip to the north; it's only natural that we lend a hand now that we are back at the lake."

Under normal circumstances, hiring Kui Qi would have cost a fortune. But the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was proud, and Xiukui was prouder still. Having just returned from battle as allies, they would never bring up the matter of payment. Ning Wan simply took out a jade slip, sketching the terrain in the air with it as they began a detailed discussion.

"Zhaojing, wait a moment and chat with our senior."

Both of them were highly skilled in the art of formations—one from a deep Daoist tradition, the other a rare talent. As their discussion grew more animated, both found they were gaining insights. No longer content with diagrams, they nodded to Li Ximing and soared into the air to survey the land, seemingly forgetting he was even there.

This left him feeling both flattered and unsure whether to laugh or cry. Lingmei, who had seen it all, sighed with a smile. "Kui Qi sees you as one of his own. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is initially very warm toward its members. If the other sects hadn't strayed from the righteous path over the years, hurting the hearts of Xiukui and Hengzhu… things would not have become so strained."

Li Ximing nodded silently. He had seen Kui Qi's attitude firsthand—he had shown no courtesy even to Daoist Master Luo, who had refined living people, let alone to Azure Pond in the past. It was no wonder their alliance had crumbled.

At this point, a suspicion began to form in Li Ximing’s mind. "Hengzhu…" he asked in a low voice, "was it because of Murong Xia's campaign to the south all those years ago? But why did it escalate to such a degree?"

Lingmei's expression grew complicated. He shook his head. "Zhaojing, you have reached a standing where I can speak freely. Regarding Murong Xia… while Luoxia never issued a direct decree, both Jinyu and Azure Pond gave their approval. The division of Jiangbei was settled… there was no going back. As for Hengzhu… alas…"

The topic clearly agitated Lingmei, causing him a degree of pain. He stroked his beard, unwilling to continue, and changed the subject with a sigh. "Right now, everyone in the north is trying to guess Lou Xing's whereabouts, which is bound to stir up trouble. Although they failed this time, our enemies got a clear look at the full strength the Supreme Yang can muster at a moment's notice. And their only losses were a few of the Merciful Ones. Incidents like this will not cease. Your clan's foundation is not as deep as theirs. Always keep something in reserve, so you can protect your own when the time comes."

For a cultivator of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, Lingmei's words were already a great show of favor. Li Ximing nodded in thanks. "Senior, I will remember your earnest advice. I was wondering, might there be a chance for my clan's disciples to enter your mountain to cultivate?"

The sword cultivator stroked his beard. "The customs of my Sword Gate are deeply ingrained," he said softly. "We can make small changes, but we cannot alter our fundamental principles. If your clan sends a disciple to learn the sword, my gate will welcome them. However… the child must be sent to us at the age of six and must sever all worldly ties, making the pursuit of virtue their highest duty."

This was tantamount to sending one of his clan’s disciples away forever. They might even receive fewer resources due to the sect's customs, and the family sending spirit items to the sect would be a source of gossip. Li Ximing was naturally unwilling. After a brief pause, he smiled and nodded in acknowledgment just as Ning Wan descended from the sky.

She first bowed to Lingmei, then smiled at Li Ximing. "Zhaojing, the thirty-two Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails have been positioned. Come and take a look."

Overjoyed, Li Ximing immediately soared into the air. He looked around and saw towering pillars of purplish-gold erected all over Pingya Island. Each one was as thick as a house, reaching for the heavens and shimmering with an intertwining purple and yellow light.

It was morning, and a white mist was rising. The pillars, near and far, were half-hidden in the hazy dawn, creating an ethereal sight. The Li clan cultivators standing on the island were all struck with awe. One or two of the bolder ones had already taken to the air, flying around the forest of colossal purplish-gold columns.

The intricate, purplish-gold patterns on the pillars shone in the air, their light casting down on the immortal pavilions below and making them seem small and insignificant. The serene atmosphere of Pingya Island was transformed by the presence of these profound pillars into something mysterious and majestic. Its former immortal air was now imbued with a solemn, noble, and enigmatic presence.

Even before the formation was complete, the mere sight of the thirty-two pillars standing tall earned Li Ximing's sincere admiration.

Ning Wan’s voice was gentle. "Of these thirty-two pillars, sixteen are on the island, and sixteen are in the surrounding lake. The ones on the island are currently resting on the surface. They are one hundred and eighty *ren* tall, but once driven into the ground, their heights will vary. The tallest, at the island's center, will have one hundred and sixty *ren* exposed. The surrounding pillars will be progressively shorter, their height also adjusted according to the earth veins. The overall light of the formation should form a protective dome."

"The remaining sixteen are in the surrounding lake, enclosing a large portion of its surface, with most of them visible above the water. These thirty-two Profound Nails are the focal points where the Purple Mansion Grand Array will gather spirit qi. In the future, you can also build pavilions and other structures upon them."

"Your clan is on an island rather than a mountain, so Sister Tinglan's design is especially precise. It's rare to see such a perfect dome shape… it's a specialty of her Purple Smoke sect."

The Purple Smoke's own Blessed Land was not built on a mountain, making its layout somewhat similar to Pingya Island. Li Ximing knew he had made the right choice in seeking out Tinglan. Of course, his island's area and especially its height couldn't compare to a true Blessed Land. Pingya Island was quite flat, with only a slight rise in the middle. The addition of the one-hundred-and-sixty-*ren* pillar would give it a total height of about one hundred and twenty *zhang*.

This was a respectable, if not exceptional, height—roughly one-fifth that of Xiaoshi Mountain in the north. Although Li Ximing felt it was a little low, it was to be expected since he didn't possess a true immortal mountain. He nodded repeatedly in satisfaction.

Ning Wan then said, "The pillars in the lake have already been driven down, and the earth veins on the island have been mapped. Senior Kui Qi is holding the pillars in place with his great power. As soon as you give the word and the people on the island are evacuated, we can set the formation!"

Li Ximing was amazed at the efficiency of the two Purple Mansion cultivators. He immediately summoned Li Jiangqian and told him to clear the island. He nodded to himself. 'Good thing the existing arrays on the island were simple placeholders with little defensive power. That's why our people have been cultivating in seclusion at Qingdu. Otherwise, this impact would have caused some serious problems for them.'

Seeing the Li family members evacuating with a mixture of excitement and trepidation, Li Jiangqian returned to report. Ning Wan smiled. "I'm afraid your previous formations are about to be smashed to pieces."

Li Ximing couldn't care less about those old things now. Besides, there was no sense in making Kui Qi hold the pillars aloft while he sent his own people to dismantle the old arrays. He waved his hand dismissively. With a flick of her sleeve, Ning Wan sent a plume of Cold Qi shooting toward the heavens.

High above, Kui Qi formed a seal with his hands and then released it. The thirty-two pillars instantly erupted in a dazzling display of purplish-yellow light. The earth veins opened, and torrents of black Baleful Earth qi surged skyward. But just as they appeared, the thirty-two behemoths crashed down.

**BOOM!**

The tallest Profound Nail in the center of the lake burst with an incandescent purplish-yellow light. A dome of purple expanded outward from the center, covering the sky in every direction before descending with a thunderous roar. Simultaneously, threads of yellow light spread like the veins of a leaf across the inner surface of the purple dome, swiftly illuminating the node corresponding to each Profound Nail.

The connection between the Great Void and the mortal world was gradually severed. The profound mechanisms of the Purple Mansion Grand Array activated, separating the space within from the space without. The mystical canopy of purple and yellow flashed to its brightest point before finally fading to transparency.

*Crash...*

With the shift in the earth veins, all the independent formations within the pavilions and courtyards failed. The houses and courtyards on the island shattered like paper windows in the face of the tremor, leaving only the sky-piercing Profound Pillars standing, emitting a soft, dusky yellow glow.

'The Purple Mansion Grand Array is complete!' Li Ximing's heart surged with excitement and awe.

Ning Wan listened to the gasps of wonder and cheers of joy coming from the shores, a gentle smile gracing her lips. She bowed. "Congratulations, Zhaojing!"

"Congratulations, Zhaojing!" Kui Qi descended from the sky with a hearty laugh, the magical radiance around him slightly dimmed, a clear sign of his exertion. After all the work they had put in, Li Ximing quickly returned the bow with a smile. "This is all thanks to my two fellow Daoists!"

Ning Wan smiled back at him. "This formation… Sister Tinglan never gave it a specific name. Please, Zhaojing, name it yourself."

Li Ximing was in high spirits. He pondered for a moment, gazed around, and then stroked his beard. "Let it be called… the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array."

The name was not chosen at random. The grand arrays of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition all had four-character names, followed by the words "Spirit Array." He saw no need to deviate. Soaring into the air, he landed on the platform atop the highest pillar.

The platform was covered in dense, gray-gold runes. The array core had clearly been integrated into these sigils, irretrievable to anyone below the Purple Mansion Realm. With a slight wave of his sleeve, Li Ximing used his Divine Ability to refine the grand array, making it his own.

Ning Wan spoke softly. "The array core is on this tallest Profound Pillar. If you need access tokens, you can inscribe them yourself. The array has the fundamental ability of a Purple Mansion Grand Array to isolate a space from the Great Void. Following the custom of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, it is divided into two layers, an inner and an outer, which are not connected. The inner array is no larger than a single palace chamber, suitable for storing treasures. The outer array is for the disciples to use."

"The array itself has two mystical functions. The first is Mountain's Anchor, which can stabilize the earth veins and gather spirit qi. Because of its powerful control over the earth veins, the thirty-two separated pillars can be used to create thirty-two different kinds of treasured grounds for cultivating disciples."

Li Ximing knew exactly where this function, so incompatible with Purple Qi and Bright Yang, had come from, and he sighed inwardly.

Ning Wan continued, "The second is Purple Visage. The thirty-two pillars can release their spirit light in concert, drawing upon the reserves in your treasury and the spirit qi on the island to create the Broad Valley Purple Visage Light for defense. As for its power… it is decent, but not exceptional."

She added thoughtfully, "This function was modified by Sister Tinglan. She followed her own inclinations… and had some very creative ideas for several of the nodes. But while it gained the Broad Valley Purple Visage Light, these changes also meant sacrificing a number of other defensive abilities."
