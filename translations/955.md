# Chapter 955: Counter

Intense light flared and churned across the sky. Murong Yan's expression twisted as the black qi in his hand recoiled at an astonishing speed. A flicker of hesitation crossed his eyes.

Even as the crisis suddenly shifted to the Spiritual Artifact in his hand, a counter-plan instantly formed in his mind:

'The best move is to step forward... enter the gate bodily, then find a chance to escape using a divine ability!'

But the instant that thought arose, the image of Li Zhouwei's smile magnified in his pupils, igniting suspicion.

'If this were a duel, I'd risk entering. But things are different now. In a chaotic battle, everything can change in a flash. If Chi Buzi is lurking, or if Great Snow's Severing Edge finds an opening to kill me... wouldn't I be walking into a trap?'

That suspicion made him hesitate for a fatal instant. But Li Zhouwei had been waiting for this very moment. His Audience with the Celestial Gate divine ability was perfected and blindingly fast. After such a delay, how could Murong Yan possibly escape? He had lost even the chance to enter the gate bodily!

"BOOM!"

An inferno of radiance erupted. Beneath a sky churning with clashing divine abilities, a gleaming celestial gate materialized. A brilliant white light, like a rising sun, shone from within its frame, so intense that cultivators on both shores had to lower their heads, daring not to look at it directly.

Beneath the gate, a single point of grey light still trembled—his Spiritual Artifact. It was like a demon trapped and suppressed, struggling defiantly. It would occasionally force the massive gate to lift a fraction, but it could no longer break free.

Murong Yan now stood far in the distance, his face grim. His once-strong arm was empty.

'Audience with the Celestial Gate...'

Murong Yan knew how powerful this technique was, of course. But as a wielder of the Valley Water divine ability, he feared suppression and grinding least of all, which had led to a natural arrogance. Now, vaguely sensing the immense pressure crushing down on his Spiritual Artifact, his expression finally shifted.

Simultaneously, waves of white light poured from the celestial gate like a tide, dispelling the abyssal gloom of his Sunless Deceit. The gate's light carved out its own domain within the pervasive aura of Valley Water.

Li Zhouwei stood atop the gate itself, feeling the faint vibrations from the struggling artifact beneath his feet. He impassively channeled more power into the suppression, his long halberd gleaming as he pointed it at Murong Yan from across the sky.

'I completely misjudged how tyrannical this Audience with the Celestial Gate is! Even if I had entered, I wouldn't be able to escape easily without using my Valley Water divine ability... let alone a mere Spiritual Artifact!'

Furious and alarmed at losing his favored weapon through a moment of carelessness, Murong Yan's face darkened. Billowing demonic qi coiled from his body, slowly coalescing into a vast, dark disc behind him.

Streaks of black light dissolved into roiling clouds, swirling around him like a colossal, hundred-tailed scorpion displaying thousands of venomous barbs while keeping its true body hidden.

'Illusory Annihilation Cloud of Valley Water!'

A golden light flared in Li Zhouwei's eyes. The Radiant Celestial Wave Art gathered around him once more, forming silken threads of light that surged forward to meet the attack.

Unfortunately, the Radiant Celestial Wave Art was not a high-grade art to begin with, and Li Zhouwei had learned it hastily. It was no match for the dense demonic qi. Though the silken threads of light pressed forward, the black qi forced them back, inch by agonizing inch.

"BOOM!"

The space between Li Zhouwei's brows pulsed with light. Spanning the sky, a beam of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light flashed and vanished like a brilliant firework, yet it struck with perfect accuracy, hitting Murong Yan's true body concealed within the heavy demonic fog.

The billowing black qi instantly faltered. But it was far from over. No matter how Murong Yan tried to hide within the mists, the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light repeatedly flashed, striking his true body with unerring precision and stifling the Dharma Art he was trying to cast.

For a moment, the sky was filled with constant flashes of white light, illuminating the dark clouds in a strobing rhythm.

"BANG! BANG! BANG..."

The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light wasn't fast enough to consistently track Murong Yan as he weaved through the dark clouds, avoiding a direct confrontation. But it didn't need to. It struck just often enough to interrupt his spell arts, completely stalling his assault.

After some time, the assault finally withered. The roiling black clouds around Murong Yan dispersed, revealing his ugly expression. He held two fingers together before him, his other hand raised. He had been forced to abandon his 'Illusory Annihilation Cloud of Valley Water' just to find an opening to summon a single ray of Valley Water demonic light.

The light was dark and heavy, like thick gauze. It moved like a fish through the lingering gloom of his Sunless Deceit, but it kept its distance, circling sinisterly. As Li Zhouwei's weapon struck, Murong Yan did not evade. Instead, he surged forward, a vicious, dark light flashing in his eyes.

"BOOM!"

A storm of golden light exploded in the sky. He had actually caught the long halberd between his bare hands. Boiling vapor and bright light erupted from the point of contact as his own demonic qi was consumed at a terrifying rate.

Colors swirled in his eyes. His mouth suddenly swelled, ripping wide open from ear to ear. A swirling, purple-black vortex formed within, swallowing all the golden light before him. At the same time, tendrils of purple-black demonic qi wrapped around the Grand Ascension, smothering its power.

The golden halberd trembled, its blade wavering. Li Zhouwei spun and leaped, vaulting through the oncoming purple-black qi. He planted a boot squarely on the shaft of his own Grand Ascension, causing the long pole to bend under the force. A brilliant light began to brew between his brows.

That single step channeled an immense amount of divine ability and dharma power. Dense golden cracks instantly spiderwebbed across Murong Yan's hands. Two of his fingers were shorn clean off and sent flying, making his pupils shrink and then widen in shock.

But the power of the Grand Ascension was far from spent. Today, Li Zhouwei was not the one left unarmed. As expected, the divine ability of Attachment flared to life once more, shining brilliantly.

Although Murong Yan still held the physical weapon locked, Li Zhouwei's heavy step caused the golden phantom-blade of Attachment to spring forth. It shot past Murong Yan's grip and plunged straight into his throat, nearly piercing clean through his neck.

The massive, expanding purple-black vortex flickered. Only Murong Yan's profound Dao-Profundity allowed him to forcibly maintain the Dharma Art. But just as he did, the brilliant beam of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light arrived right on cue.

"Psh..."

A blinding golden light flashed, and scorching heat washed over him. Murong Yan's pupils reflected the golden glare as his spiritual sense swept frantically. He was horrified to see Li Zhouwei's hand already reaching for the Radiant Sun King's Halberd at his waist!

'Not good!'

He reacted instantly. The purple-black vortex in his mouth stagnated and contracted as he tried to pull back. But the beam of Li Zhouwei's Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light faded even faster!

The man had only feinted, brushing his hand past the Radiant Sun King's Halberd with no intention of drawing it. Instead, he lifted his boot, converting his step into a vicious kick that slammed into the halberd's long shaft.

"BANG!"

Murong Yan had just retracted his spell art, releasing his grip on the Grand Ascension. The kick sent the halberd, now blazing with intense Bright Yang radiance, bursting free. It tore from his grasp—slicing off several more fingers—and plunged deep into his chest.

"Pfft!"

The golden light of Attachment flared on the halberd, only to unexpectedly sputter and die. Li Zhouwei's eyes sharpened. His hands were already clasped before his chest, precariously trapping a small, fish-like wisp of black Valley Water demonic light.

"Greeaa..."

The demonic light ground slowly forward within his grip, emitting a sound that set the teeth on edge as dense demonic qi sprayed into his face. Murong Yan seized the opening to cough up a gout of blood, his expression filled with regret.

His spell art had been seen through, so he had immediately switched tactics. Grabbing the weapon, pressing forward—it was all for this one counter-attack. He never imagined his opponent's barrage would be so relentless, forcing him to unleash his Dharma Art prematurely.

"BOOM!"

An intense light exploded from Li Zhouwei's hands. Tendrils of demonic qi, sharp as blades, pierced the radiance. In that brief, violent impact, both figures vanished.

"Pfft."

Murong Yan reappeared. A golden light flashed from the gaping wound in his torso, deep enough to reveal his organs. Both his hands were now fingerless, reduced to bloody palms and splintered stumps of bone.

His face showed no trace of pain. He silently flicked his ruined hands. Bone regrew, flesh and skin knitted back together—in a mere moment, they were fully restored. The wound in his torso also sealed over, concealing the golden light within.

When it came to regeneration, as a Valley Water demonic cultivator, only cultivators of Horn Wood could compete. But Horn Wood specialized in healing others, while Valley Water excelled at self-healing. At an equal level of divine ability, they were still a step behind him in this regard.

Yet there wasn't a trace of pride in his eyes, only a flicker of uneasy hesitation.

'He chose to strike my chest... not pierce my Sea of Qi...'

In that moment of hesitation, Li Zhouwei flicked the demonic qi from his own palm. A misty white energy enveloped his hand, slowly healing the injury. The Grand Ascension hovered silently beside him, circled by four rings of white light.

As they faced each other, both seemed to detect something amiss in the other's eyes, an unspoken suggestion. Just then, brilliant rays of light descended. A Maha with a horse-like face and a black serpent coiled around his body appeared from thin air, flanked by several other golden-bodied figures.

Taixi had arrived.

Ning Wan, who was silently controlling her formation and resisting Shilou Yingge alongside Zhusheng, was already struggling under the latter's True Fire. When she saw the brilliant lights tearing through the snow, her expression paled.

"Fellow Daoists, what brings you to the north?"

The Maha's booming laugh echoed from the sky, drawing shouts from the cultivators below. Unfortunately, Mahas were generally despised, and Taixi was a prime example. Murong Yan visibly frowned. Shilou Yingge, who was already fighting with ease, merely shot the newcomer a cold glare.

The expressions of the southern cultivators, however, shifted. Li Zhouwei quickly assessed the new development and frowned inwardly.

'This is too soon...'

Taixi's gaze swept across the faces of the northern contingent, and he cursed internally.

'What a mess of people!'

Taixi was a Maha of the Way of Emptiness, and the Gao family had always hated him. And Shilou Yingge... although he advocated restoring compound surnames, the clan feud between them was all too real. He certainly wouldn't want Taixi's help. The Murong family, on the other hand, should have been an ally. After all, Murong had helped promote his own faction's Maha Liangli, and even Zhelu, the number one expert of the Way of Emptiness. They should be close. But Taixi knew his own business. Zhelu was absolutely unwilling to be a puppet for Murong and the Way of Great Desire, and had been making his own moves recently. Taixi's own standing was what mattered; he really didn't dare get too close. Besides, Taixi clearly recognized the White Qilin. Though he coveted it greedily, he was afraid to make a move. Great Snow's Severing Edge was also terrifyingly strong. He had already scanned the battlefield. In the end... that Mansion Water sword cultivator looked like the easiest target.

And so, with a loud laugh, he rode his cloud downward.

Chen Yin's cultivation was a notch below Xindu's. He had only lasted this long because he'd spent a lifetime of savings on the newly forged Spiritual Sword in his hand, and because his opponent hadn't been willing to risk injury. But one glance at the descending Maha sent his heart plummeting.

'Why are they coming for me?!'

The four Merciful Ones in the sky exchanged glances, each calculating. After a brief hesitation, they all followed Taixi, riding the wind down.

Chen Yin broke out in a cold sweat, sensing imminent doom.

'This is the force they're sending me to block?!'

He didn't hesitate for a second. He recalled his sword and retreated, empowering himself with his Mansion Water divine ability. But Xindu, seeing the reinforcements, had no intention of letting him escape. His eyes fixed on the man's Spiritual Sword, and greed flared in his heart.

'No wonder they say Jiangnan is wealthy. Even a sword cultivator with no apparent backing has his own Spiritual Sword! If I can get my hands on that, I wonder how much I could trade it for?'

Empowering himself with his divine ability, Xindu shot forward, tangling with Chen Yin. The Merciful Ones immediately moved to encircle them, preparing to form a trapping array.

Only Taixi hung back, a smile on his face. He didn't dare advance, watching furtively while keeping a constant, wary eye on Ning Wan's position.

There was no other reason. He was simply terrified of Great Snow's Severing Edge.

'I also have to watch out for the Sword Intent sealed in that Spiritual Artifact. Compared to the northerners, these people from the south probably hate me even more... It's better to let the Immortal cultivators fight amongst themselves. Just as it's been for a thousand years, let them wear each other down...'

Chen Yin barely had time to raise his hand. His Spiritual Sword thrust upward, unleashing a wave of chilling white light. The effort to just neutralize their combined assault made his face drain of color, and he nearly vomited blood.

The awkwardness of his predicament didn't end there. A hasty slash from his sword tore through the white-robed demonic cultivator before him, cleaving the man's dharma body in two. But the demonic cultivator's expression never changed; his body simply dispersed and reformed, pouncing once more.

Chen Yin understood perfectly. Why had Xindu and Taixi both singled him out? Because he had no trump cards. He was an easy target. And his new Spiritual Sword naturally drew their greed. But they had no idea of the difficult position he was in.

Unlike Li Ximing, he, Chen Yin, had achieved his divine ability back when the Supreme Yang was dominant. He didn't have a privileged position like Xiao Chuting. He had long been bound to the Immortal Clan through the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Although that pressure had eased in recent years... the shackles on him were still far heavier than those on Li Ximing.

'I had no choice but to get involved... After all, the materials for this sword were a favor from someone else... How could I refuse? But if my life is on the line, who would be willing to die guarding the Supreme Yang's interests!'

A savage light filled his eyes. He cast aside all other concerns, turned his Spiritual Sword vertical, and lifted it with all his strength.

'Hundred-Light Fractal Sword Art!'

The deep blue Spiritual Sword in his hand instantly split into eight copies. As he raised his fingers, the phantom swords formed a great arc around him, all emitting a brilliant white sword-light. The light reflected brightly in the old man's eyes.

"Kill!"

This was a life-or-death crisis. Chen Yin held nothing back, clearly putting his life on the line. The light from the eight Spiritual Swords intensified, flaring out in shafts as wide as doors, shielding him. A torrent of Mansion Water energy surged around him, extinguishing all the incoming spell arts.

Chen Yin truly had skill. The Mansion Water Dao Lineage was also quite unique. As he unleashed his full power, the divine abilities beneath his attackers' feet were extinguished. An irresistible pull rose from the Mansion Water torrent below, dragging them involuntarily downward.

But just as the eight Spiritual Swords flared, something shot out from the Great Void.

It was a purple alms bowl, banded with two black rings. The mouth of the bowl was a dark void, but the purple body glowed with extreme brightness, instantly suppressing the raging Mansion Water torrent below!

The Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl!

Taixi's Treasured Artifact had been refined specifically to control water and fire. It instantly seized control of the Mansion Water divine ability. The other cultivators reacted, channeling their own divine abilities to break free from the pull.

"What a fine divine ability!"

The first to break free was, naturally, Xindu. That demonic cultivator prioritized his own skin above all else. The boots on his feet were actually a spirit embryo; they flared with light, allowing him to break free of the suppression instantly. He formed a hand seal, overjoyed.

'Coming south was the right choice! Such good treasures to be had!'

His power was already high, and now he saw a chance to seize the Spiritual Artifact. He held nothing back. His eyes turned crimson, and two motes of pale golden light shot from his pupils, flying like venomous wasps.

Chen Yin pushed his divine ability to its limit. Gritting his teeth, he ignored the incoming attacks and tried to step into the Great Void. But the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl was already waiting there, hanging high as a splendid purple light shot directly at him.

"Pfft!"

The situation had turned dire. A flicker of hesitation crossed Chen Yin's eyes. As desperate as he was, he had to blunt this attack first. His Spiritual Sword snapped back to parry, just as he heard Xindu laugh.

"Hand over the Spiritual Sword, and I won't harm you!"

How could Chen Yin possibly agree? He had spent half his life's worth of spiritual materials to forge this sword, not to mention countless fortunate opportunities and ancestral treasures. The entire Chen Clan's wealth wouldn't be enough to cover its cost!

Besides, though his opponent was laughing, his divine abilities rained down all at once. The golden artifacts of the surrounding Merciful Ones followed, striking Chen Yin until he spat blood again. His eyes reddened as he grit his teeth.

'The more dangerous the situation, the calmer I must be. I have to find an opening to escape, or I'll just be forced to continue this fight in the Great Void!'

But just as he was being overwhelmed, he heard a sound from the Great Void. A halberd swept across the sky, trailing purple fire and unleashing a riot of divine abilities!

"BOOM!"

A potent white divine ability exploded against the halberd. Its crescent blade snagged several of the golden artifacts at once. The pressure on Chen Yin vanished. He stared in astonishment at the person who had appeared before him, but his hands didn't slow. He tore open the Great Void again, only for that splendid purple light to shine in his eyes once more.

This time, however, he wasn't being pincered. Someone was holding back his pursuers; he didn't need to fear them. If he could just endure this purple light and accept a minor injury, he could escape!

But Chen Yin hesitated. The light of his Spiritual Sword dimmed, then flared again. In the end, he didn't take the step to escape. Instead, he thrust his sword out with lightning speed, blocking a divine ability aimed at Li Zhouwei's flank with a sharp 'clang.'

Chen Yin's action took Li Zhouwei by surprise for a moment, drawing a faint smile. Without hesitation, Li Zhouwei put his strength into his arms, reversed the halberd, and tore it free with a clang. He spun the weapon and leveled its point, his eyes locking onto Xindu.

The demonic cultivator (Xindu) was clearly furious, though whether at Murong Yan or Li Zhouwei was unclear. But his surging anger and greed were quickly tempered by a cold calculation of strength. If there was no profit to be made, why was he even in this fight?

'Where is Murong Yan? He couldn't even keep Li Zhouwei busy!'

He had barely finished the thought when the aura of Murong Yan's Sunless Deceit swept over from afar. He had already joined the battle in the sky, moving to suppress Zhusheng and Ning Wan!

Xindu glared sullenly at the pair. But as Li Zhouwei turned his halberd, a golden ring burst from the Great Void and clamped down on it. It was Taixi's new Treasured Artifact.

The golden ring was imposing, resizing in mid-air. It clamped onto the Grand Ascension's crescent blade with a clang, then immediately tightened, shaking violently. Li Zhouwei held the halberd in one hand, but the weapon was clearly suppressed by the ring, and he couldn't free it.

'Good!'

Xindu was overjoyed and lunged at Chen Yin once more.

"BOOM!"

Flames flickered high in the sky. The magical snow that had enveloped the area finally dissipated, revealing a white formation flag fluttering weakly in the air.

'Ning Wan and Zhusheng are failing... The northerners want to wipe us all out, or at least suppress everyone long enough to loot some treasures.'

Li Zhouwei's expression hardened. He planted his halberd beside him. The golden ring held fast, suppressing its divine abilities. His eyes turned cold and sharp, sweeping from Taixi—who was silently slipping into the Great Void—to the nearby Xindu. A deep rumbling began to echo from the clouds above.

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

The moment the divine ability's power began to manifest, the already-cautious Merciful Ones paled in fright. Even Taixi shot a wary glance, his eyes falling on the Radiant Sun King's Halberd at Li Zhouwei's waist.

Li Zhouwei was a figure of great renown, after all. Who among them, especially the Buddhist cultivators, hadn't studied him? They instantly scattered. Xindu, seeing that he was the target _again_, looked furious and began to laugh out of sheer anger.

'What in the world does this have to do with you? I've never heard of your Li family being close to the Chen Clan. You even let Murong Yan's Spiritual Artifact go, but you insist on ruining my prize!'

Taixi's artifact was still tangled with his halberd in the Great Void, so this Audience with the Celestial Gate was clearly just meant to force him back. Xindu retreated, furious and unwilling, and turned his head back.

Only then did he realize Li Zhouwei wasn't using the art at all—he had used the threat to break from the encirclement and was charging right at him!

Xindu finally understood. He was being targeted because he had no powerful backing. Even knowing Li Zhouwei's illustrious bloodline, being singled out like this time and again made him laugh in fury.

"You think this Daoist Master is so easy to bully!"

His eyes blazed. A white mist covered his face as he played his trump card. Seeing the Audience with the Celestial Gate 'miss,' he lunged forward, sneering.

'Your Spiritual Artifact is bound, your divine ability missed. Let's see how you handle my divine ability!'

But Li Zhouwei seemed utterly unconcerned that his weapon was entangled. He stood coldly before Xindu, and with a flick of his sleeve, unfurled a scroll painting.

'What kind of Spiritual Artifact is that?!'

Xindu's heart trembled, but he blasted his white light forward with all his strength. He was shocked to find the scroll seemed perfectly ordinary. It had a faint aura of Pristine Water, but no dharma power whatsoever. It was just a painting of a person.

The man in the painting was unfamiliar, with green robes and green hair, and a distinctly evil appearance. Some kind of demon...

Believing it to be some defensive Spiritual Artifact, he didn't hold his divine ability back at all. The white light blasted the scroll to smithereens and slammed squarely into Li Zhouwei, sending him flying back a dozen yards, coughing up blood.

'That's it?'

Xindu froze, his first instinct to scoff. But a cloud of doubt instantly enveloped him. His gaze darted across the battlefield and met Murong Yan's distant expression—who looked like he had just seen a ghost and was about to burst into tears.

But that look lasted only an instant. Murong Yan, the raging True Fire, Shilou Yingge, the fluttering snow... all of it was gone. They were all fleeing into the distance.

'Hm? Why are they... flying manually?'

The hair on his body stood on end. His spiritual sense flickered, and a horrifying, delayed realization sent a chill from the crown of his head straight down his spine.

He couldn't connect to the Great Void.

The Merciful Ones below were still oblivious, their jeering laughter echoing in the sudden silence, grating on his nerves. He spun around with lightning speed, but his movement froze.

His pupils dilated to their absolute limit, reflecting a pair of blue-purple, serpentine eyes. They seemed to be sneering.
