# Chapter 1188: Extraordinary

Upon hearing Lu Jiangxian’s words, the ancient cultivator set down his cup and began to weigh the proposition.

‘Reincarnation… into my Myriad-Prosperity Heaven…’

When Qi Lanyan had first fallen into his grotto-heaven, Tang Xie had suspected the hand of an outside power. Qi Lanyan was a figure from the Guanhua Daoist tradition; if he attained the Dao within Myriad-Prosperity Heaven, he could very well become its master. Though only a head remained of him, Tang Xie understood with bitter clarity that the schemes of the great powers were insidious and all-encompassing. They could never be underestimated.

Myriad-Prosperity Heaven itself held little worth plotting over. Its Daoist scriptures and treasures had long been lost to the dust of history. The only things of value—things that would even be of great use in the eyes of a Dao Embryo—were the Tapestry of Concealed Sublime Resources i.e., the Rank Designation of Treasured Earth.

Thus, while he had spoken to Wang Ziya of other possibilities, in his heart, he had never truly considered Qi Lanyan for the Treasured Earth position.

‘True, the Numinous Treasure and Guanhua traditions both stem from the Comprehending Profoundity Orthodoxy… but that would only give the Orthodoxy the perfect excuse to reclaim Myriad-Prosperity Heaven and its Rank Designation!’

Ultimately, Qi Lanyan was still an outsider.

‘The True Monarch back then had attained the Dao from Beyond the Profound and failed to gain Luoxia’s recognition, so he could never find his way into this grotto-heaven. But if an outsider were to become the Treasured Earth within my Daoist tradition, and with Luoxia’s backing, he would absolutely be able to locate the grotto-heaven his Dharma Body once inhabited!’

Throughout the vast river of history, it was not unheard of for cultivators to have their past and present lives straddle two Profoundities. Their allegiances were often fluid, shifting to whichever side held the most power. How could Tang Xie possibly take such a risk?

The moment he heard the request, Tang Xie’s guard had shot up. It only lowered slightly when the other mentioned a different path. Yet, his knowledge was vast; he identified the scheme within the words almost instantly, but it stirred a different, peculiar emotion within him.

‘Sheji… Azure Profoundity intends to make a move on Sheji? And using a physical body and Dharma lineage from the Comprehending Profoundity Orthodoxy, no less?’

He mulled it over for a long while before finally speaking.

“It is a pity, but my Myriad-Prosperity Heaven’s Dao court possesses only one or two inheritances of the Treasured Earth… I can offer little assistance… very little assistance…”

‘I am quite aware of what you have in your Myriad-Prosperity Heaven.’

Zhengao smiled faintly and replied, “Fellow Daoist misunderstands. It is not essential that he succeeds. The great calamity is approaching, and this is merely a place for him to take refuge. Success would be a welcome bonus, but if he fails, when the time comes, another path will be ready for him.”

‘The great calamity is approaching…’

Although Wang Ziya had just spoken of chaotic times to come, hearing those words from someone of Zhengao’s stature was another matter entirely. A deep worry bloomed in Tang Xie’s heart as he said aloud,

“I see… I was merely afraid I would fail the task.”

Behind Zhengao, Lu Jiangxian watched his reaction, his focus sharpening.

He had intentionally steered the conversation this way, ending with the prophecy of a coming calamity. The plan had been to combine this with his own connection to the Supreme Yin to probe for any schemes by Luoxia and the other Daoist traditions. But this man was completely oblivious.

‘On second thought, it’s not so strange… He’s been holed up in this grotto-heaven for years without leaving. He would naturally be unaware of the plots being woven by the great powers outside…’

A smile surfaced on his face, and he spoke with practiced courtesy.

“It is no matter… There is just one thing I must make clear, fellow Daoist. The heavens have not yet manifested in the world; the will of the Supreme Yin to remain concealed must be honored. This matter must be locked behind your lips, never to be spoken of…”

The immortal general rose to his feet, the smile vanishing from his face. He paced the hall and said quietly,

“I only fear that a moment of carelessness might occur. I fear that before a word of this profound secret can pass your lips, you will face the calamity of utter annihilation, both body and soul!”

Tang Xie was not surprised. A bitter smile even touched his lips.

“Revealing secrets has been a cause for death since ancient times. I am just an old relic, unable to even move. How could I make such a grievous error and invite the fires of the Supreme Yang? You can rest completely at ease, fellow Daoist.”

Zhengao smiled.

“A routine reminder, nothing more… You need not dwell on it. If our colleague succeeds, we would not be so stingy as to forget rewarding you. We would not leave you trapped within this Rank Designation, unable to move.”

At these words, the flicker of anxiety in Tang Xie’s heart was finally fanned into a flame. He lowered his voice.

“That would be no simple feat! If the heavens could grant such a thing, it would be as a second life to me!”

Tang Xie’s soul was at the level of a True Monarch, unlike a mere Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. He couldn’t be fooled by simple illusions. He was well aware that this body had been condensed by a divine ability and had even guessed that his soul alone had been spirited away.

But with his own Dharma Body on the verge of perishing, his reaction was the polar opposite of Chi Buzi’s. He found it perfectly reasonable; in fact, he felt that extracting a soul from across a Rank Designation was an even more brilliant display of power than taking his entire body would have been.

Lu Jiangxian had long since inspected Tang Xie’s head. The Metallic Essence of its divine ability was already perilously weak. The only thing truly intact was the soul, which still carried the status of a True Monarch.

Years ago, when his disciple-brothers of the Treasured Earth Dao Lineage had perished and their Fruition Attainment had been seized by an outsider, the divine power of the disciple-brothers guarding the grotto-heaven, which stemmed from that very Fruition Attainment, was thrown into chaos. In a panic, they made a desperate choice: one would perish, and the other—Tang Xie—would sever his own head and hide behind the Rank Designation to eke out a miserable existence, hoping to avoid being found by the newly ascended True Monarch Guan Shi.

When True Monarch Guan Shi eventually perished and the Fruition Attainment vanished, Tang Xie found himself in a new, awkward predicament. He had reached a state where leaving the Rank Designation meant instant death. Before meeting Lu Jiangxian, his only hope for escape was to raise a new True Monarch of Treasured Earth to free him.

Even for Lu Jiangxian, dealing with such a situation would be incredibly difficult.

‘Although the Name Ascending Stone would allow me to anchor his True Spirit to my own status, to truly restore him would undoubtedly require the Metallic Essence of the Treasured Earth… either of extremely high quality or in vast quantities…’

In his current circumstances, obtaining the Metallic Essence of the Treasured Earth was nothing more than a pipe dream. However, Tang Xie’s peculiar and miraculous state gave him another idea. It made him think of someone.

“Yuanshang.”

Daoist Master Yuanshang had been reaped by the Underworld, everything from his Metallic Essence to his very soul. All that remained was a tiny spark of his True Spirit, which Lu Jiangxian had secretly managed to save. The discovery had filled him with both shock and delight.

He had nurtured that spark, hoping to slowly coalesce it into a soul and make Yuanshang a cultivator of the Immortal Palace. But even after all his time spent diligently cultivating the Quest for Gold method, the resulting soul remained fragmented, constantly at risk of dissipating.

Now, as he mentally dissected the state of Tang Xie’s head, a wave of enlightenment washed over him. He finally understood.

‘The reason is that Yuanshang had, in essence, already transcended the Purple Mansion Realm.’

In the language of the Underworld, he was a demon. But from the perspective of the Woven Jade arts, he had already achieved the substance of Woven Jade, but had failed to connect with the Supreme Yin Fruition Attainment and take that final step.

‘So… I shouldn’t be trying to construct an ordinary soul for this wisp of True Spirit, forcing him back into the mortal coil. I should be finding a way to give him that final push, helping him ascend to a higher plane.’

‘The best method would be for Li Zhouwei to break through to the Golden Core realm. Once I cross that threshold and can command the power of a True Monarch, I could help Yuanshang forge a True Monarch’s soul in an instant and achieve Woven Jade!’

But until then, was there a way to make use of him? Lu Jiangxian thought it might not be impossible—Tang Xie was the perfect example.

His expression shifted subtly as he replied, “You speak truly, fellow Daoist… The Treasured Earth is a distant path, after all. We lack the power to trouble the great one to personally reforge your body. However, we do know a few figures who possess formidable divine abilities. If you still recall the techniques of this false immortal state, I could make some inquiries on your behalf.”

Hearing this, Tang Xie stroked his beard and fell into thought.

In his eyes, Zhengao was undeniably one of the most high-ranking beings present. For someone like him to speak of figures with divine abilities, they must be of the Yuyi Immortals who had achieved Woven Jade. It wasn't that Tang Xie feared they would covet his techniques—without a True Monarch of Treasured Earth, the methods were useless. He was more overcome with shock and suspicion.

‘My own status is not low. How could a few Woven Jade masters of a similar level solve a predicament that spans across Dao paths? Unless… unless the one above him is a genuine Golden Core Monarch!’

‘To casually command Golden Core Monarchs… to have them live in seclusion with him… who else could it be but Dongjun?’

The smile on his face grew even more radiant. He paused for a moment before speaking.

“The true source of the spell arts lies in a heaven-reaching divine ability of my Dao Lineage’s founder. As for the cultivation methods and Dao techniques, I have some records. Most of it, however, is a cultivation art bestowed upon me by the founder after I achieved the false immortal state!”

Lu Jiangxian was both pleased and concerned. He was pleased that Tang Xie clearly possessed something of value, but concerned that the man’s path to the Dao was likely a custom creation made by Xu Xiang through some grand divine ability. Zhengao, however, simply replied without a care, “That is of no consequence.”

Tang Xie manifested a jade slip and began meticulously recording the information. Soon, it was in Zhengao’s hands. The immortal general nodded as he read, occasionally letting out murmurs of admiration. Tang Xie sat across from him, holding a cup of clear tea, greedily reacquainting himself with the long-lost sensation of having limbs.

But even the most cherished moments must end. The immortal general finally finished reading the techniques and lowered his head to sip his tea. The interlude had not been short, yet it had passed in what felt like the snap of a finger. As if waking from a dream, Tang Xie rose to his feet, releasing his long-suppressed unease.

“This junior has committed the heavenly command to memory and will naturally do my utmost,” he said in a low voice. “But I only know how to arrive; I do not know the way back…”

‘Impressive… He knows an Immortal Lord is behind Zhengao, yet he can still resist his greed at a moment like this… He’s actually asking for the way home.’

Lu Jiangxian felt a flicker of admiration. Zhengao, meanwhile, wore a gentle smile.

“That is simple enough. I have many friends and colleagues who travel frequently between the heavens and the mortal world. Guards!”

The hall echoed with his call, and an immortal official entered, holding a scroll. Zhengao smiled.

“Escort Daoist Master Tang out through the Celestial Gate.”

“This junior takes his leave. My respects to the supreme divine ability, and my sincerest wishes for the Immortal Lord’s boundless longevity…”

Tang Xie bowed solemnly, his heart pounding. Suppressing his turbulent thoughts, he followed the official out of the main hall. Zhengao simply watched the false immortal depart, his smiling face unreadable.

Just as he reached the threshold of the great hall, Tang Xie finally tugged at his sleeve and sighed. He turned back.

“This supreme celestial palace is a sight one can never forget,” he said quietly. “I wonder… will there be another chance to meet with the immortal general?”

He had been locked away in that grotto-heaven for an eternity, staring day after day at the same pale yellow gauze, the torment in his heart immeasurable. This was the first time in thousands of years he had felt truly alive. How could he not be moved?

What made it more difficult was his awareness of the other’s lofty status. This meeting was a courtesy granted only on account of his lineage’s founder; they had no real need for him. If he didn't speak up now, Zhengao would certainly not offer him a way back.

Faced with his expectant gaze, Zhengao seemed almost troubled. He shook his head.

“That is hard to say. You are not a celestial official of our court, nor do you possess a body of your own. You cannot simply cross the Celestial Gate at will. You can only wait for when the merit official at the gate is on duty, and he might be able to guide you into the celestial realm for a visit.”

Tang Xie wanted to come at any time, but Lu Jiangxian feared it would expose his deception. After all, the likes of Dangjiang and Shaohui were too ignorant to handle him; the only person in the heavens who could receive him was Lu Jiangxian himself, and he couldn’t monitor the gate constantly. He decided to stall.

“When that time comes,” he said with a smile, “a ray of the Supreme Yin’s clear light will pierce through the void. Your soul will surely sense it.”

Tang Xie nodded with a hint of regret. He walked away with great reluctance, each step feeling like three, his eyes drinking in the celestial scenery. He grew ever more awestruck, and soon he arrived before the enormous Celestial Gate. Before he could even begin to admire it, the official beside him spoke.

“My apologies, Daoist Master Tang!”

An immense force struck him, and he plummeted into an endless sea of clouds. A crushing sense of suffocation overwhelmed him, forcing his lips slightly apart as an icy coldness washed over his face.

“Hah!”

He snapped his eyes open.

Darkness surrounded him, illuminated only by the faint, pale yellow glow filtering through the gauze. The tightly wrapped Spiritual Treasure and the profound medicinal pill sat neatly before him, as if a great deal of time had passed.

He managed to shift his eyes and realized the cold sensation was the smooth floor beneath him. It was as if he had simply dozed off. Only the profound powerlessness and the lingering feeling of suffocation served as stark reminders that it had not been a dream.

‘Such miraculous skill!’

A short gasp did nothing to alleviate his wretched state; it only intensified the agony of his paralysis. Hiding behind the Rank Designation, the last vestiges of his dignity had vanished. Though his face remained calm, it was a mask for the violent turmoil in his heart. He stared blankly at the pill, his lips moving without a sound.

‘Azure Profoundity…’

Tang Xie gazed vacantly at the hazy yellow light, forced to re-evaluate his position in the world.

‘When this great one manifests in the world, what will happen?’

‘This is Dongjun! Of all the great powers in the world, the only one qualified to meet him is the master of Luoxia. The others, like Beiyao and Xiyan, wouldn’t have even been able to find the Supreme Yang Profound Palace in ancient times… to say nothing of lesser figures like Beijia. They would likely be too terrified to even remain in the heavens!’

A brief, fervent heat flickered in his eyes.

If he received this favor, he would undoubtedly stand on Dongjun’s side when the time came, and he would have no need to fear for his life. As for aligning with the Supreme Yang and potentially damaging his ties to the Comprehending Profoundity Orthodoxy…

‘How could it be improper for the Three Profoundities to shelter under the same eaves?’

Moreover, in Tang Xie’s view, though Luoxia, as the fourth direct line of the Comprehending Profoundity Orthodoxy, was currently powerful, he would never concede that they represented the entire tradition. A cold sneer formed in his heart.

‘I may have been hidden in this grotto-heaven, ignorant of the details, but even if I did not see the process, how can I not see the outcome? In the Sheji incident back then, was it not your Wu Light Dao Lineage that used the She Immortals? Yet we were the ones forced to bear the blame!’

‘It seems… some people’s good days… are about to come to an end.’
