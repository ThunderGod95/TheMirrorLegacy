# Chapter 1063: The Dao of Nine Mounds

Li Ximing listened, and doubt began to surface in his mind.

'If... all six of the Chongming Scions' jade caskets are inside the Grotto-Heaven, how could one be out here? Besides, the timeline makes no sense. When Pingya Island was shattered, how old was the Green Pine Temple Grotto-Heaven? It's impossible for something to have escaped...'

He looked up at Lingdu, his expression thoughtful. "Do you know what happened to all those jade boxes? What was inside them? And... I remember there were numerous treasures under the prayer cushions in Chongming Hall. Weren't they all supposed to be miraculous? How were they handled?"

"Azure Pond's was lost. Purple Smoke's is here. The rest are in the hands of their respective Dao Lineages. As for what was inside... honestly, the valuable ones were empty. The ones that weren't empty just held small mementos of the patriarchs."

"The only truly valuable item was a treasure from the main hall called the Silent Bell."

Lingdu's eyebrows rose, his face filled with yearning. "I've heard it can change size. At its largest, it's like a mountain, the supreme Dharma Treasure. At its smallest, it's like a cup or a bell, appearing as a mere Spiritual Artifact or dharma artifact. Even a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator could use it! When it conceals its nature, it becomes like a common object; even a True Monarch could be fooled...

"Inscribed within it are countless profound Dao arts, allowing one to commune with heaven and earth and channel Material Transformation. It ultimately landed in the hands of that eminence from the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition. That lord expended immense effort to acquire it, all for the sake of Daoist Master Qiushui's breakthrough!"

Seeing Li Ximing pensive, Lingdu wasn't surprised. He just chuckled.

"Whatever you're speculating, every Purple Mansion Realm cultivator back then had the same idea. They all figured that items used by such mighty figures must hide some profound mystery. That's the only reason so many of them bothered to carve up the spoils... Otherwise, why would that many Purple Mansion Realm experts fight over items fit for the Foundation Establishment Realm, or even mere mortal trinkets?"

"But... they were sorely disappointed. For the True Monarchs who are still living, their respective Dao Lineages naturally reclaimed their belongings. The few trifles that got out were useless. Only one or two were ever refined into spirit embryos."

He poured more tea, sighing.

"True Monarchs don't leave such wonders lying around. They prefer to conceal their presence, to obscure their Fruition Attainment. If a junior cultivator held one of their items, wouldn't it be like a beacon broadcasting their name? Not only would they attract the attention—and manipulation—of other True Monarchs, but it would also constantly reveal the status of their own Fruition Attainment. That is _not_ a good thing."

Li Ximing nodded inwardly. He understood this perfectly. Those who had formed a Golden Core and attained fruition left no traces; their very presence was scrubbed from the world... As he mulled this over, a new thought struck him.

"Green Pine Temple... has it really only opened once? I seem to remember that Guo Shentong, Changxiao, and that group... they also emerged from a Grotto-Heaven, didn't they?"

Changxiao was an old thorn in the Li family's side. Seeing that the old man before him was both knowledgeable and approachable, Li Ximing decided to seize the chance to kill two birds with one stone. He watched Lingdu sip his tea.

Lingdu smiled. "Guo Shentong, Yan Jianxiao... even Li Mei from the Sword Gate. They all came out of the same Grotto-Heaven, one from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition. Back then... I was cultivating in the markets of the Eastern Sea and heard a whisper or two. It was called the 'Chuyi Grotto-Heaven.' And the one who gained the most from it wasn't Changxiao."

His expression grew solemn. "The very first to enter were the Miao Family and Situ Tang. There was another powerful figure, too, named Qu Tan—the grand-master of the current Daoist Master Xuanyi of Mount Jingyi. Those three went in first!"

"Within the Chuyi Grotto-Heaven lies the Encompassing Profoundity Mountain. It has three tiers, brimming with countless treasures, most of them aligned with Earth Virtue. On the highest tier, the 'First Mountain,' there are even Spiritual Treasures..."

As Li Ximing listened, he suddenly recalled the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain. Understanding flashed through his mind.

'So I _had_ heard of this Grotto-Heaven... When Zhu Gong mentioned the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain, she said it was a treasure from beneath the First Mountain of Encompassing Profoundity, and that Senior Lingmei obtained it... It was an Earth Virtue item, that's right... Could Daoist Master Xuanyi's Corner-Cleansing Merit Bottle have come from there as well?'

But Lingdu didn't pause, his voice dropping.

"And on that mountain, there is a spring. It connects to the Pure Qi above. Cultivating beside it allows one to seek a divine ability! Even if you can't cultivate there, just a single drink of its water is an immense boon."

At this, Yan Dushui's eyes lit up. Li Ximing's brows shot up, his expression startled. Lingdu nodded grimly.

"I asked the Great Daoist Master. It is, indeed, the Wuguan Legacy. Those cultivators back then all drank from that spring. Especially Qu Tan. His power was formidable, but his aptitude was poor—he had the least hope of anyone in the Purple Mansion Realm group. But by relying on that spring, he attained the Dao. A true carp leaping the dragon gate..."

The old man's tone shifted. "The Chuyi Grotto-Heaven has opened more than once. Green Pine Temple is no different. The world is full of talents. A batch of them slipped in secretly... the likes of Zhang Cuotian and Guo E..."

Hearing this, Li Ximing had a moment of sudden clarity.

'It _was_ Zhang Cuotian! The false identity of that marketplace master, Chen Taoping! That item... it must have come from the Grotto-Heaven. If so... where are the rest of the contents?'

Li Ximing fell into pensive silence. But Yan Dushui, who had lived abroad for so long, knew nothing of Green Pine Temple. His thoughts were entirely consumed by the Chuyi Grotto-Heaven.

"That Grotto-Heaven," he asked, his voice laced with hope, "is there any... any chance of entering? My descendant... I would only ask for a single drink from that spring!"

Lingdu gave him an empathetic look.

"Such opportunities are rare. Moreover, not just anyone can reach that place. And even if they could, they would need a descendant capable enough to seize the opportunity."

Though Lingdu's words were polite, Yan Dushui understood. With his remaining lifespan, he would never live to see it open. He certainly lacked the power to secure such a chance for his descendants. He sighed, offered a respectful bow, and departed in silence.

Li Ximing watched him go. Now that they were the only two left on the mountain, he also prepared to leave. Just as he was about to, a thought struck him.

'Daoist Master Yuandao has deep ties to the Peacock. He only helped me back then to collect that karmic fire... The Radiant Crimson Fiendfire I have now came from those Buddhist cultivators. This is the perfect opportunity to ask about it.'

He steered the conversation with a smile, then retrieved the precious pearl from his sleeve. It instantly flared with a dazzling golden light, shimmering with hypnotic, glazed colors. Lingdu's eyebrow rose.

Li Ximing smiled.

"Is Nine Mounds interested in this?"

Lingdu accepted it with both hands, scrutinizing it. After a dozen breaths, he said, a note of uncertainty in his voice,

"Radiant Crimson Fiendfire... Which fool defiled this? They had the Peacock's ambition but lacked the Peacock's power and standing. How pathetic."

Lingdu truly hailed from a great Daoist Tradition. He was slower to identify it than Li Ximing, but his insight was still profound. Li Ximing smiled.

"I acquired this from a Buddhist cultivator up north. I figured I'd try my luck here in the Immortal Dao."

Lingdu stroked his beard, silent for a long moment, his expression troubled. "It's not that the item isn't precious. But the spiritual resources required to purify it... that is a massive cost. To say nothing of the immense effort involved..."

Just then, a hot gust of wind swept across the mountain peak. An exceptionally tall young man materialized at the table. He was dressed in formal, profound robes, a silk sash at his waist, his eyes crinkling with a smile.

'Daoist Master Yuandao!'

Li Ximing shot up from his seat, bowing with a hint of trepidation.

"Junior pays his respects, Great Daoist Master!"

When Li Ximing had first come here, he was green. He knew the man was powerful, but he had no concept of _how_ powerful. Now, having seen countless experts and great masters across the land, he finally understood the terrifying weight of the man's 'Perfected divine ability.'

'This is a _perfected_ divine ability!'

'This Daoist Master Yuandao... he might be the most powerful cultivator I have ever met! Even the Lord of the Profound Governance Pavilion is probably his inferior!'

Furthermore, now that he had cultivated the World's Radiance, his perception was far keener. The man stood before him, yet he commanded the spiritual pulse of the entire mountain range. A hazy, crimson Fire Virtue draped over him like a robe, and a shocking realization struck Li Ximing.

'His life-mandate is whole... He... he has a real chance to attain the Great Dao.'

His bow was far deeper than it had been all those years ago. Daoist Master Yuandao, however, seemed exactly the same. He smiled, gestured for Li Ximing to sit, and remarked,

"Your divine ability has progressed swiftly."

Li Ximing murmured that he was undeserving. Daoist Master Yuandao didn't press, instead taking the pearl. He held it between three jade-white fingers and commented lightly,

"This is from the Murong family, of the Way of Compassion. No wonder you were in a bind."

His handsome eyes turned to Li Ximing, a subtle hint within them. He smiled.

"Another Blazing Fire, and one outside the category of True Conjoined Triple Fire. A troublesome thing to resolve."

How could Li Ximing fail to understand? He flushed, unsure how to respond. It was horrifyingly clear: the little secret he'd guarded for years was no secret at all to the man before him.

'The Intercalary Sun Art came from Senior Junjian. Since Senior Junjian is so close to Nine Mounds, the Great Daoist Master must have known about the art long ago. It's not surprising... He probably knew from the very first time I visited.'

But the art was too valuable. Unsure of the implications, he couldn't be the one to broach the subject. He played dumb, nodding quickly.

"I came this time to ask the Nine Mounds Daoist Tradition to help me neutralize the Buddhist cultivator's methods within it. I can provide equivalent items to cover the spiritual resources... Once this Blazing Fire is purified... I was hoping to trade it within the Immortal Dao for a wisp of Radiant Fire..."

His gaze was pleading. "My family is small. It would take me ages just to gather the materials, never mind the painstaking effort to unravel the technique. It could take decades. Nine Mounds is a great and noble sect... and an expert in this Dao..."

Yuandao listened, then lifted his cup.

"Very well," he said softly. "But I cannot guarantee the quality of the Radiant Fire."

Li Ximing blinked, stunned. He realized Yuandao wasn't particularly interested in the fire itself; he was simply doing him a favor. He agreed immediately. Yuandao flipped his hand, storing the pearl, and said calmly,

"Wait on the lake. This will take time. Daoist Master Lingdu will contact you when it is done."

Li Ximing breathed an inward sigh of relief. He'd already been delayed long enough, and Daoist Master Yuandao showed no sign of wishing to chat. He called Li Que'wan up, gave her some quiet instructions, and then tactfully excused himself.

Li Que'wan wasn't surprised. She had assumed when they arrived at Nine Mounds that her Daoist Master was finding her a place of sanctuary. She properly thanked both Daoist Masters and obediently withdrew.

In moments, only Yuandao and Lingdu remained on the peak. The master of Nine Mounds, he of the perfected divine ability, showed a rare trace of approval.

"That girl's Dao-Profundity is remarkable. I see she also practices shamanic arts. Qiushui was at a similar level back in her day... Not bad at all."

He was speaking of Li Que'wan. Lingdu looked surprised, as if he'd seldom heard Yuandao offer such high praise.

"I think it's a pity... We already have one Qiushui."

Daoist Master Yuandao smiled and shook his head.

"No, you should say it is _fortunate_ we already have Qiushui. That girl is no longer young, and is only just now seeking her divine ability. If not for that, given how intent the lord of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition is on securing the Whole Pill, she would have been crushed. Remember Great Daoist Master Miaoqi from the Western Sea? She had neither the destiny nor the desire to attain the Dao, but simply because she glimpsed the Purple Mystery, she lost her life-mandate."

"From what I see of the Li family, besides Li Zhouwei—the one descended from Bright Yang—only this girl's talent is noteworthy. Senior Xuan'an allowed her to cultivate the Whole Pill because he calculated it was already too late for her to interfere with Qiushui. She might even be able to ride Qiushui's coattails, so to speak, and align with the Golden Oneness of Highest Azure faction."

A thoughtful look crept over Lingdu's face as he understood.

"Which is why she is still... just a girl."

Daoist Master Yuandao smiled but didn't reply, taking a sip of tea.

"He likely knows about Tu Longjian. He's sensible, so he didn't ask, but I'm sure he's guessed most of it."

Lingdu lowered his gaze.

"After you helped him so much... how could he not?"

Yuandao rose, clasping his hands behind his back.

"Master left Nine Mounds in my care. I often worry I do too little, or that I do too much. This stems from the Fox-kin's arrangements, a remnant of the Immortal Mansion. Our relationship should be close. If the world's situation weren't so tense, we should have warmly received his disciples and helped him sort out his Dao Lineage."

His deep eyes gazed into the distance.

"Now, add to that the debt we owe Tu Longjian, of course we must help. I shouldn't have hinted, but Bright Yang descendants are a suspicious lot. Without a reason, he'd refuse the aid. We just can never speak Tu Longjian's name. We'll repay the favor this way, and keep him from being dragged too deep into the Bright Yang conflict..."

Lingdu looked both worried and resigned. He quickly rose and stood beside him.

"But... when the Bright Yang matter concludes and Donghua Heaven falls, Senior Xuan'an's situation will be... difficult. That Li Que'wan... will you... shield her?"

Yuandao tapped the table lightly.

"If I succeed, and Senior Xuan'an comes to an agreement with the lord of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, protecting her shouldn't be a problem."

Lingdu exhaled slowly.

"I see... In any case, Junjian will find it hard to do nothing. And... there is the _other one_ on the mountain."

Lingdu's "in any case" was a euphemism for what would happen if Yuandao _failed_. Such words were taboo. But Yuandao understood.

The normally placid Great Daoist Master looked troubled.

"No one in this world is without sin," he said softly. "We are all born indebted. Tu Longjian is righteous by nature; he wants me to fail no one, which is not good. It was fine when his cultivation was low. But now he's a significant figure, and he still clings to that pure heart. I'm afraid he will shatter his own Dao."

Lingdu was silent for a long time. "Whether it shatters or fulfills... it's impossible to say."
