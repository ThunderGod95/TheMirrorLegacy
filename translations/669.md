# Chapter 669: The Southern Sea

Bai Rong's cart, though unassuming in appearance, was anything but slow. In little more than a month, they had plunged deep into the Southern Borderlands, riding a gale of cyan wind that never paused for a moment.

Only when they ventured into the depths did a few demons dare to block their path. The leader was a wolf demon with a green face, long fangs, and hair like crimson flames—a starkly different appearance from the demons of Jiangnan. Bai Rong barked at them twice.

"Elder here is the White Fox of Mount Li! Who's the blind fool blocking my path!"

The wolf demon's expression changed at his words. His lupine face, already ugly, contorted into a frown. He blinked his four eyes and stammered, "So it's Elder Fox! My apologies, my apologies! Now that you two Elders have crossed the ridge, why not stop by my king's place for a visit? This humble demon will heat some tea and serve you a few blood buns."

Bai Rong glanced at him skeptically. "And which backwater mountain does your king rule that he dares invite me for a visit?"

The four-eyed wolf demon replied respectfully, "He is the Black Ape Great General, serving under the Bifeng Mountain Lord. He resides on Black Lacquer Ridge…"

"Get lost! Such nonsense!" Bai Rong's face fell at the mention of the Bifeng Mountain Lord. With a wave of his hand, he sent the demon flying a dozen yards. "Just a monkey, and far too much trouble!"

The two demons were sent tumbling by the demonic wind he kicked up. They yelped in pain, but scrambled back to their feet and shouted after him, "Be careful, Elder! There are shapeshifting shamans near the ridge, and they're treacherous creatures…"

Bai Rong had already sped several miles away, the two demons still calling out "Elder" as they saw him off from their mountain. Li Zhouwei wore a thoughtful expression. Bai Rong stole a glance at him and said, a little awkwardly, "I don't know those local demons at all! Don't overthink it. It's just custom for one of my kind to announce ourselves when passing through another's territory…"

"I see."

Sensing the odd tone in Bai Rong's voice, Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes swept over the forest below. After a brief pause, he asked, "This Bifeng Mountain Lord must be a Purple Mansion Realm demon, I presume? What is his background?"

"Well…" Bai Rong fumbled in his robes, pulling out a few fruits to offer him. But he was too slow to change the subject. He had no choice but to answer. "The Bifeng Mountain Lord… is called Can Lufu. He is a descendant of the True Hornless Dragon's nine sons, tracing his lineage back to the Eighth Prince… whose corpse is still stuffed at the bottom of the Vermillion Sea."

"That's why, even though Can Lufu is a Flood Dragon, he never dares venture into the Eastern Sea. He just holes up here in the Southern Borderlands, lording over his domain and colluding with the other great demons. He's an old one."

'Can Lufu…'

The name struck Li Zhouwei like a thunderclap, and he finally understood the source of Bai Rong's discomfort.

'The Demon King of the Southern Borderlands, the peak Purple Mansion Realm Bifeng Mountain Lord, Can Lufu.'

'It was he who refined my own ancestor…'

Bai Rong knew full well that one of Li Tongya's own brothers had been refined by Can Lufu, which was why he had immediately tried to put distance between them and the demon's territory. Only now that they were far from that mountain range did he dare to speak in detail, his voice low.

"Can Lufu is a great demon on the same level as my master. He was also an ally of Chi Wei's back in the day… As a descendant of the Eighth Prince, he is incredibly powerful."

Li Zhouwei watched the mountains recede into the distance, etching the name of the Bifeng Mountain Lord into his memory. His tone, however, betrayed no emotion. "Is his true form an Azurewater Flood Dragon?"

"Indeed." Seeing his calm demeanor, Bai Rong let out a sigh of relief. "If the dragon lineage hadn't disowned him, he might be calling himself a Dragon King by now. He's also skilled in alchemy, which gives him some influence in the Southern Borderlands."

"Four hundred years ago, he was already at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm… Around that time, he led an attack on the newly established Azure Pond Sect. Chi Wei must have met him then."

Li Zhouwei committed this to memory. Bai Rong tried to placate him. "It was hundreds of years ago… Let it be… Can Lufu is an ancient demon, a true powerhouse among Purple Mansion cultivators. Even my master would be no match for him."

Li Zhouwei smiled and nodded in agreement. Only then did Bai Rong truly relax. He pointed at the distant forests and patted his chest. "Ordinary cultivators have to go by way of the Eastern Sea to reach the Southern Sea, but you won't need to. In the future, if you wish to come here, you can just ride the wind straight through. If any of those mountain lords or valley generals try to stop you, just swat them aside!"

Li Zhouwei said softly, "Wouldn't that offend them?"

"Of course not!" Bai Rong laughed heartily. "You saw it yourself. Did a single minor demon we passed not call us 'Elder'? These lesser demons who have gained sentience have no hope of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm; they're nothing but errand runners. And that's only because I'm of the fox tribe. If you were a tiger or a leopard, you could snatch one up and command it at will."

The ocean gradually appeared on the horizon, dispelling the oppressive atmosphere. Bai Rong's mood brightened. The waters of the Southern Sea were a deeper hue, and the climate was hot. The great continent of Lufang was already in sight, its trees a shade of dark green, soaring into the clouds.

But Bai Rong veered eastward. The seawater slowly turned a shade of turquoise, a clear sign they had reached the Vermillion Sea.

The Vermillion lay at the southernmost edge of the Eastern Sea and the eastern edge of the Southern Sea. True to his lazy nature, Bai Rong stopped at its border. He casually grabbed a passing minor demon, dispatched it to inform the sea patrols, and then turned his cart back around.

"That Dingjiao fellow will find his own way here. We'll go on ahead."

He steered the cart back on its windy course. Li Zhouwei gazed out at the landscape. The eastern part of the Lufang continent was dotted with countless islands, yet they were sparsely populated. Though covered in dense jungle, he saw no cultivators flying about.

'How different from the East Sea.'

In the East Sea, not a single island would be left vacant. Who would let such prime real estate go to waste as they did here in the Southern Sea? Bai Rong glanced at him and explained quietly, "In the Southern Sea, cultivators build their immortal caves and manors at the bottom of the ocean. These islands are the private gardens of major powers, protected by formidable formations. They're used for cultivating spiritual resources, gathering Qi, and converging spiritual veins…"

"As for mortals, they live on the large continents like Lufang and Songzhou. They're scattered about, but the continents themselves are probably as large as the Yue State."

Li Zhouwei nodded in understanding. The floor of the Southern Sea was not occupied by the dragon lineage, making it vastly more expansive than the surface. It was a world unto itself, so there was no need to live on the islands.

Furthermore, the Southern Sea's connection to the mainland was not as strong as the Eastern Sea's. The Southern Borderlands stood as a massive barrier. To gather Qi from the mainland, one would have to cross nearly the entire Vermillion Sea—a journey fraught with unimaginable danger. This made preserving the local islands for Qi gathering all the more critical.

"Further south is Danrong Wuluo, a region with a high concentration of Buddhist and demonic cultivators…"

The name Danrong Wuluo jogged Li Zhouwei's memory. Li Qinghong had once mentioned that a certain elder of their clan was cultivating there… an illegitimate son from Li Yuanqin's generation, if he recalled correctly.

'Once this business with the dragon lineage is settled, I should make a trip to Danrong Wuluo to meet this elder… I wonder if he knows that the family's patriarch has fallen.'

Li Zhouwei and Bai Rong traveled for the better part of a day, heading deep into the sea. Ahead of them lay a vast expanse of white seabed, dotted with coral, glowing as brightly as if it were daytime. A dense network of houses and streets spread across it, bearing a striking resemblance to the Tailend Kingdom of old.

A thin, shimmering barrier enveloped the seabed, marking it as a marketplace. Bai Rong, his eyes alight with excitement, immediately put away the cart, threw on a cloak, and descended toward the city.

Li Zhouwei followed him down. The market's grand formation served only to part the seawater. As they passed through it, no one came to greet them. The streets were bustling with people moving to and fro.

"Let's look around. The dragon lineage will be here within three hours at most!"

Bai Rong eagerly looked around, buying shells here and coral there. The cloak he wore concealed both his cultivation level and the fact that he was a demon, allowing him to move through the crowd like a fish in water.

Li Zhouwei wandered about more casually. He first bought a map. The vendor, seeing his Foundation Establishment cultivation, presented the item and then scrambled away, not even daring to accept the spirit shells offered in payment.

Li Zhouwei studied the map for a moment. "What a coincidence. This is the Miao Family's territory!"

According to the map, the Miao Family's domain was immense, ranking them among the top powers in the Southern Sea. Even the Zhulei Market they were in, and the Zhulei Cave beneath their feet, belonged to the Miao.

'Thunder arts truly are a powerful tool… Most cultivators in the Southern Sea practice demonic arts, all of which are suppressed by thunder arts to some degree. Though the Miao Family's direct lineage isn't large, their territory is vast. The advantage thunder arts have over demonic arts is simply too great!'

He glanced around. Nearly everyone he saw was a demonic cultivator, and items made from blood essence were everywhere. Looking closer, he noticed that nine out of ten of these items were refined from demons. Pills made from humans were so expensive as to be completely unattainable.

'The Southern Sea has few people but many cultivators—a mix of Buddhist, demonic, immortal, and shamanic practitioners. Humans are a rare commodity here… The major demonic arts have all been modified over time to use demons as sustenance.'

He took another look around and noticed many mortals moving through the market, smiling and addressing cultivators as "lord." In a corner, two children were chattering away, casually discussing the divine abilities of Purple Mansion cultivators.

It dawned on him in an instant.

'The mortals of the Southern Sea live within underwater formations, and most of them are related to cultivators in some way… On one hand, their population is small, so their lives are not in peril. On the other hand, their connections to cultivators protect them from being harvested.'

The land in the Southern Sea was nothing like the mainland. In Jiangnan, an acre of land could support a family. Even the laziest farmer could simply toss seeds on the ground and not worry about food. This abundance was what sustained the yearly losses of the Three Sects and Seven Gates.

The Eastern Sea also had few people and many cultivators, but it received a massive influx of spiritual grain and blood essence from the northern and southern cultivators of the mainland, so it was of little concern. The Southern Sea was in a much more difficult position. Aside from a few large continents, the rest of the mortals could only survive in underwater formations, living side-by-side with cultivators.

'So… the Southern Sea, renowned throughout the world for its demonic cultivators… actually has a remarkably stable social order… Mortals rarely face mortal danger, their lives are closely intertwined with cultivators, they have a clear understanding of cultivation, and their role is to serve the cultivators…'

A sarcastic smile touched his lips. 'The people of the Buddhist lands are sallow and gaunt, hoping for death from the moment they are born. The common folk under the Immortal Sects are ignorant and unenlightened, waiting quietly to be culled. Yet here, in this southern demonic sea, people know why they live and why they will die. The Great Dao of cultivation is right beside them.'

As the lord of his own lake, Li Zhouwei was no stranger to the complexities of human nature. He had always heard that the Southern Sea was overrun with demonic cultivators, but seeing it with his own eyes, the discrepancy sparked a revelation. He immediately came to a realization.

'But these people only refrain from preying on humans because there are too few to be worth the trouble… They were forced to capture demons for alchemy, and it gradually became a habit. If they ever had the chance to go to the mainland or the Eastern Sea, where humans are as common as gold, they would likely be more ferocious killers than anyone.'

He was silently observing the Southern Sea's extreme system of cohabitation between immortals and mortals, looking for something he could adapt for his own use, when Bai Rong returned, his arms laden with shells and coral. He picked out a glittering blue conch and pressed it into Li Zhouwei's hands with a grin.

"I have many little foxes back in my cave. It's not often I get to go out, so I have to bring them back some treasures. I couldn't leave you out!"

Li Zhouwei accepted it with a small smile. The conch was merely an Embryonic Breathing-level artifact, capable of stirring the seawater a bit. He thanked the fox, not wanting to refuse the kind gesture, and tucked it into his robes.

Bai Rong beamed, humming contentedly. He leaned in and whispered, "My great-grandmother told me that when she came to the Southern Sea back in her day, there weren't so many demonic arts and blood-essence techniques. This area was quite desolate. It was only after the Miao Family rose to power that demonic arts suddenly proliferated throughout the entire sea—and high-quality ones at that."

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei immediately sensed something unusual. He frowned. "I had heard that the Southern Sea has long been known as a sea overrun by demonic cultivators…"

Bai Rong scoffed. "A long time ago, while they were demonic arts, they were just common, low-grade stuff. There were also plenty of wood, earth, and water-based cultivation methods… There were even several immortal sects. Now, you can't find a single one. And isn't that the Miao Family's handiwork!"

Putting the pieces together, Li Zhouwei finally understood how the Miao Family had established their immense power in the Southern Sea.

'What a ruthless method. Disseminate high-grade demonic arts in a place like the Eastern or Southern Sea, where everyone is struggling to survive… Once those arts take root, things are no longer so simple…'

'Nearly half of all demonic arts don't even require one to gather Qi… as long as one consumes enough blood essence.'

'The Miao Family controlled the thunder-art cultivation methods and Qi-gathering techniques, allowing them to rest easy. Then, they spread various convenient, low-barrier, and fast-cultivating demonic arts across their vast domain. This immediately squeezed out all other cultivation methods until no one practiced them anymore…'

'Then, their own direct descendants could rely on their abundant resources to cultivate thunder arts. When they went out, which of them couldn't completely dominate their opponents?'

He shook his head, thinking, 'No wonder they say the Miao Family is a clan of thunder arts, yet also people of the demonic path. Whether they themselves consume blood essence or not, I don't know… but this single strategy reveals the depths of their cunning.'

As Li Zhouwei was pondering this, Bai Rong began to mutter again. "Kid, the demonic calamity in Jiangnan mostly originated from the Blood Asura Scripture, and that technique also belongs to the Miao Family… The Golden Feather Sect borrowed it from them… That Golden Feather Sect… they're all a bunch of schemers too. Just look at their rise to power. They're now the unrivaled leader of the Three Sects, and the Seven Gates fear them like tigers. That alone shows how formidable they are!"

Li Zhouwei understood immediately from his words. 'He's giving me a roundabout warning…'

The Golden Feather Sect didn't actually have any major conflicts with his family; in fact, their relationship was quite good. The Li family had gathered Qi in the great desert for many years without anyone daring to disturb them, which Li Zhouwei was certain wouldn't have happened without the Golden Feather Sect's tacit approval.

Furthermore, it was rumored that Li Tongya and Zhang Yun were good friends, and the disciples of the Golden Feather Sect had always been polite to the Li family…

But Bai Rong had given the warning, and Li Zhouwei could only take it to heart. He said humbly, "This junior will remember!"

Bai Rong glanced at him, seemingly worried his pointed words might have caused offense. He asked a few cheerful questions, but just then, a roar echoed from the sea. Turquoise waves surged, and the clanking of iron chains rang out.

*BOOM!*

A colossal Azurewater Scaled-Beast slowly materialized above the seabed. A resplendent and luxurious palace floated in the ocean, its immense black shadow swiftly blanketing the entire marketplace. Even the luminous pearls that lit the city dimmed.

The cultivators in the streets all looked up, staring dumbfounded at the scene in the water above. The sound of a conch horn boomed, and a familiar cry echoed from the sea:

"The Clear Seas and Serene Pools Azure Dragon Prince's honored chariot is here—"
