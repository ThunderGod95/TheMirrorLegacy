# Chapter 977: Upper Rite

CLANG!

The long halberd swept left and right, parrying two stabbing spiritual armaments. The immense recoil forced the two Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues back a step, but a golden shadow vaulted from the halberd, smashing heavily onto the house-sized head of one Spirit Statue and unleashing a tempest of force.

A Heavenly Light seized the opportunity to pierce through the tempest, aiming straight for the Spirit Official protected by the two statues. This official possessed a keen awareness and immediately retreated, but it hadn't accounted for the attacking Daoist Master, who had already summoned Hidden Light, smashing it heavily into the official's body.

White smoke billowed instantly. The two Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues immediately reversed their weapons, stabbing at the man behind them. But Li Zhouwei did not lower his Celestial Pass. His body was already wreathed in black flames.

[Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts]!

Black flames surged behind him, extending four arms that suddenly snatched the two beam-sized weapons from the air. Though his form was like an ant trying to shake a tree, he didn't budge an inch. Instead, the two Spirit Statues staggered, kicking up a cloud of dust.

His divine ability condensed. His two hands formed a seal in front of him, and only then did he summon the divine ability,

'Audience with the Celestial Gate!'

The massive Celestial Gate immediately fell from the sky, carrying surging purple flames. It didn't target the Spirit Statues behind him, nor the Spirit Official trapped by Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light in front. Instead, light and flame intertwined, moving to suppress the silver-white profound bell in the sky!

He had no need to entangle himself with the three Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues. 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' excelled at suppression. The Statues were mindless. His plan was simple, grab the prize and leave. The power of Spirit Probe unfurled, and the location of every spiritual thunder in the sky instantly imprinted itself upon his mind.

BOOM!

This profound bell was certainly a treasure, and its connection to the Spirit Official was deep. But how could it withstand the full suppressive force of 'Audience with the Celestial Gate'? In an instant, its dharma light dissipated, and it reverted to its original form, a silver bell, only the size of a fist.

Li Zhouwei's hands didn't slow in the slightest. Those golden eyes lit up. Scale-like patterns reappeared on his face. The hands forming the seal immediately released, and he suddenly turned, pressing one hand in front and one behind onto the two massive weapons!

He gritted his teeth. Golden light climbed the weapons from his hands like lightning, then quickly spread to the two Spirit Statues. The bodies of the sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues were tough, but how could Li Zhouwei's own dharma body be any weaker?

“Up!”

Instantly, terrifying dust clouds billowed. The two mountain-sized Spirit Statues were ripped from the ground. For a moment, they were as weightless as dolls on a catapult, shattering the air with sonic booms. They spun rapidly, a full two circles, before he flung them. Like comets radiating heat, they soared into the sky.

Their target was the exact location of the thunder-wreathed, purple-gold profound mace. The man who had just snatched it, Miao Huanzun!

Li Zhouwei was wreathed in flashing flames and qi waves. His divine ability had already retrieved the silver bell. He wasted no time on the Spirit Official. With the spirit embryo in hand, his body transformed into golden light and streaked across the sky!

---

The thunder in the sky raged. The three Purple Mansion Realm cultivators surrounding the purple-gold mace and Miao Huanzun felt a sudden chill up their spines. They looked up almost simultaneously. But the terrifying sonic boom arrived an instant later, momentarily stunning them,

BOOM!

The two mountain-sized Spirit Statues had smashed down!

The statues were already heavy and sturdy. The thunder in the sky was instantly shattered, scattering light. Miao Huanzun, bearing the brunt of the attack, felt his pupils shrink. He forcefully shifted half a body's width. His thunder dharma power was shattered and scattered, erupting into rolling thunder plasma before re-gathering. He had barely steadied himself, stunned, when a golden light plunged from the sky even faster.

The rapidly enlarging golden body and the face covered in golden scale patterns reflected in his pupils. Miao Huanzun only had time to retreat, roaring with his divine ability,

“It’s the White Qilin!”

On the other side, the black-robed man reacted fastest. He raised a hand, facing the assaulting Heavenly Light, and exhaled a blast of black-water wind, blowing straight at the pouncing man. His expression was grim as he shouted,

“How is there another one!”

This black-water wind rolled forth, like a gale from a sea cliff, carrying a damp, sticky, yin aura. It blew at the golden light, transforming into wisps of ensnaring, disorienting light, attempting to push him away.

But Li Zhouwei's eyes snapped open. Dense Heavenly Light instantly turned his eyes pure gold,

'Sovereign's Perilous Tread!'

'Seize the moment, return to the path!'

The rolling black wind seemed to become an anchor for his movement. Instead of being pushed back, his speed accelerated by a third. He shattered the black water. The long halberd instantly magnified, exploding with a deafening boom against the black-robed man's frantically raised hands!

“Zzzzt...”

The man instantly became an arrow loosed from its bow, hurtling clang into the sea of clouds below. Rolling multicolored light and Heavenly Light wove over his body. Li Zhouwei didn't waste another divine ability. He snapped his head around, his dark golden eyes—revealed after the pure gold faded—fixed on Miao Huanzun.

Miao Huanzun felt both aggrieved and furious. A fiery thought shot into his mind,

‘Damn beast! Am I the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert or are you... You really think no one can deal with you!’

In the Grotto-Heaven, the strongest were the Great Daoist Masters. Below them, naturally, were the three-divine ability, mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Miao Huanzun knew he was a step below figures like Touba Ci, but excluding a few major powers, he, Miao Huanzun, was still a highly ranked expert!

'Let me teach you to respect your seniors!'

In the span of that single thought, the White Qilin's halberd was already stabbing toward him, carrying three bright, dancing streams of white light. Multicolored light spilled everywhere. Miao Huanzun sneered internally, flicking his sleeve and summoning a small purple fork.

The fork was about an arm's length, a mix of purple and white, but it was infused with purple-black thunder, making it stand out. With a clang, the fork blocked the halberd. Miao Huanzun immediately summoned a purple gourd, but unexpectedly felt a chill on the back of his neck. The people who had besieged him earlier were attacking again.

He was forced to use a divine ability to block. His eyes transformed into thunder light, seeing through the incoming azure divine ability. He was just that one step late. Another golden light leaped from the halberd, stabbing at his face.

Grand Ascension's [Attachment]!

This marvel had achieved many merits, and this time was no exception. Miao Huanzun was momentarily stunned. He had to interrupt his action, spitting out a mouthful of thunder to cope. But Li Zhouwei suddenly exerted his strength, his divine ability condensing as he spun the halberd again.

“Bang!”

The purple thunder on both sides instantly exploded. Grand Ascension pressed forward another fraction against the thunder fork, almost stabbing into Miao Huanzun's eyes. The brilliant Heavenly Light shone on his face, dissipating his defensive divine ability and causing him to break out in a cold sweat.

“You!”

Li Zhouwei's surprise attack had brought him right in front, giving Miao Huanzun no time to react. The radiance from between his brows burst forth, smashing bang into the divine ability protecting the other's face!

“BOOM!”

Miao Huanzun reacted extremely fast. He knew Li Zhouwei possessed a Dharma Art that originated from between the brows. Dense purple lightning had already covered his face. But Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, enhanced by 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread', had reached a new level. It instantly snapped his head back. He was dizzy, coughing up black blood. He extended two fingers, his eyes cold with anger, also activating a divine ability!

But right at that moment, a sharp, cold edge was born from the shadows, stabbing straight at Miao Huanzun's brow! Li Zhouwei didn't look back. He already knew who it was,

Chen Yin!

One of the three who had surrounded Miao Huanzun! And one of the reasons Li Zhouwei believed he had a chance to snatch the prize!

Spiritual sense was limited. Others might not know who was snatching what, just grabbing whatever was closest. But Li Zhouwei saw the situation most clearly, even able to measure his own chances of success at each location. That was why he hadn't acted immediately, but had waited patiently for an opportunity!

Now the situation was clear. The Grotto-Heaven was too vast. Even with all the thunder making a huge scene, the most advantageous competitors in the short term were still Miao Huanzun and Touba Ci. Touba Ci was clearly more interested in the set of three short swords... As long as Chen Yin was willing to side with him, or even just show a little bias, dealing with Miao Huanzun would be no problem at all!

Miao Huanzun was cold and furious. Even if Chen Yin hadn't made a big name for himself, he had spent a fortune in recent years forging a Spiritual Sword. Paired with his Sword Origin, even he couldn't ignore it. Finally, purple light shot from his eyes, and he roared,

“Insolent!”

A purple-black light pierced heaven and earth. Silver-white Profound Thunder fell from the vast dark clouds. But the moment it landed on him, it instantly transformed, becoming purple-black thunder that spun around him, emitting a deep, heavy roar,

“ROAR!”

'Edict of Pacification!'

A powerful purple-black light pulsed outward. The Spiritual Sword trembled in the thunder. Chen Yin was instantly thrown back several zhang, streaks of thunder invading his body and causing him great pain. Simultaneously, another invisible figure was forced out of the air, stumbling back several steps, his face grim. His Thousand-Eye Demon Robe shimmered. It was the Southern Borderlands' Daoist Master Luo.

“Clang!”

The purple-black light pushed forward. Li Zhouwei slammed his halberd down in the air. Heavenly Light and multicolored clouds gathered. 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' activated. The Talisman Qi in his body resonated and neutralized the attack, sweeping all the thunder from his body. He only retreated three steps!

Li Zhouwei was suddenly surprised.

'It can activate Talisman Qi?'

The Bright Yang Dao inherently possessed the marvel of breaking demonic arts. But the Miao Family's thunder was special. Although it used a unique method to stain it with blood qi, it wasn't classified among the arts that could be broken by such methods. Thus, they had always been able to roam the world, calling themselves orthodox. But while 'Bright Yang' didn't recognize the "evil" thunder, his [Illuminating Sun and Moon]'s demon-breaking, evil-dispelling function did react!

Such a perfect opportunity! He had no time for further thought. The scale patterns on his face grew brighter, the radiance between his brows blazing infinitely. Taking advantage of the moment his opponent thought he was suppressed by the thunder and his dharma power was failing, his divine ability rolled and activated,

[Emperor Qi's Light].

A round hole appeared between his brows. Inside, it was dim, without a trace of radiance. But its edge was extremely bright, like a solar eclipse, and it was aimed directly at Miao Huanzun!

Miao Huanzun excelled in thunder dharma power, using spell arts to defeat his enemies. His divine ability, 'Edict of Pacification', was a clearing ability. The closer the distance, the greater its power. It was perfect for when he was forced into close quarters by an expert in Body Divine Abilities. He had been waiting for this exact moment, when everyone was near him, to activate it and make his escape.

Now that he had shocked them all, he immediately prepared to ride the thunder away. He even had time to raise his purple gourd, preparing to leave a cluster of lightning for them. He never expected that just as his dharma power began to circulate, his Life Divine Ability would send another urgent warning of danger.

“Hm?”

He saw the solar eclipse at the man's brow suddenly contract. Infinite light swarmed out from it—countless streaks, thin and sharp, curved and winding, gold at the front and black at the back, dragging long, thin tails. Like vipers, they surged forward, one after another, shooting toward him at a terrifying speed.

“What Dharma Art is this!”

His calculation had been good, but who could have predicted his divine ability would be so easily neutralized? Fortune and misfortune were truly two sides of the same coin. This slight pause had plunged him into endless trouble. They were too close; he couldn't even shift sideways. He could only raise his sleeve, forcibly interrupt the divine ability in his hand, wrap his body in a streak of lightning, and snarl,

“Such guts!”

The words never even left his mouth. The dense Emperor Qi's Light was already dancing, pouring over him like rain. The small, thumb-thick, gold-and-black streams of light were unbelievably fast and sharp. Thunder arts were not known for defense, especially at this range!

His body shook violently. Even with his own divine ability active, it was like being trapped in a ceaseless fire-hell. Puffs of purple blood mist sprayed from his front and back as the streaks of light embedded themselves in his flesh and thunder. More streaks of this Qi Light climbed onto the purple-gold profound mace, forcibly suppressing his thunder light and locking it down!

But what terrified him even more was that Li Zhouwei's eyes lit up again. The solar eclipse between his brows suddenly reversed, light born from the darkness.

[Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light]!

Miao Huanzun's one misstep filled his heart with an infinite chill. He immediately understood his choice, either abandon the Spiritual Artifact in his hand and flee, or take this beam of light head-on and plunge himself into a disastrous, perhaps critically injurious, situation! In such an intense competition, suffering a heavy injury meant he would have no more major gains in this Grotto-Heaven!

No matter how reluctant he was to part with the thunder artifact, Miao Huanzun was ultimately a decisive man. He let go. His body dissolved into rolling thunder plasma and scattered into the distance. He didn't even leave a threatening word; he just silently and wretchedly dispersed.

Only the small, snake-like, gold-and-black Emperor Qi's Light remained, locking the purple-gold profound mace as it fell into the White Qilin's hand.

Li Zhouwei held his halberd in one hand. The black flames behind him stretched out an arm to catch the mace. He stood in the clouds like a fierce god. His two black-flame arms held a green cauldron and the thunder mace. His gaze was sharp, without a hint of relaxation. He tilted his head slightly, as if listening for something.

“Petty tricks!”

He sneered and suddenly raised his hand, fast as lightning, grabbing something from the empty air. A piercing sound erupted. Rolling black qi rose from his hand, mingling with boiling golden qi. It was a speeding divine ability-dart!

The dart still struggled in his grasp. His gaze, however, wasn't on his hand, but fixed straight ahead on the pale-faced, black-robed man.

This was the same Purple Mansion Realm cultivator he had just knocked from the clouds. The man had unfortunately been intercepted by the falling Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues, delaying him for over a dozen exchanges. He had anxiously used a divine ability to suppress them and hurried back, but he was one step too late. Now, he could only look at Li Zhouwei with a wary gaze.

Li Zhouwei didn't ride the wind and retreat like Miao Huanzun. Miao Huanzun cultivated thunder; his escape art could definitely get him away from three people. But his 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' wasn't good for fleeing, and he didn't want to cause a huge commotion. So, his eyes remained fierce, quietly watching his opponent. The hand pinching the divine ability-dart squeezed slightly.

“Peng!”

A burst of golden fire, a spray of black water—he had crushed the divine ability dart with his bare hand.

As his golden eyes swept around, the old man holding the sword bowed slightly and vanished. The demonic cultivator in the Thousand-Eye Demon Robe gave an awkward laugh and silently put away his dagger. The black-robed man sighed heavily and also retreated.

At this moment, the world was gradually quieting down. Only the rumble of the Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues giving chase remained. Through the heavy clouds, at the other end of the area, Touba Ci also secured the three thunder short swords. He gave Li Zhouwei a deep look, summoned his carriage, and the rumble of wheels quickly faded into the distance.

As the cultivators who had obtained spiritual thunder quickly retreated, the sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues were rapidly closing in. Li Zhouwei saw that Touba Ci had finished and there was no further opportunity to be had, so he didn't stay a moment longer. He instantly transformed into Heavenly Light and sped away.

'The harvest isn't bad! Miao Huanzun just condensed his third divine ability, and two others didn't want to see him succeed…'

The golden light on his face slowly faded. The solar eclipse between his brows also dimmed and vanished. He used his Spirit Probe ability, having long since locked onto an unexplored direction. Only then did he pretend to look around, riding his light casually. He raised his hand, revealing the purple-gold mace.

This mace was purple-gold, 4 chi 2 cun long. The handle was relatively short, and the body was four-sided. Dense patterns covered it, all depicting the subjugation of Demons and the pacification of the world. It felt numbing to the touch, its silver-white light restrained. A fine weapon indeed!

The weapon was sealed in the cauldron. It still had an owner, so it couldn't be refined quickly, nor could it be stored. He just tied it with Heavenly Light and fastened it to his waist. He flipped his hand again, revealing a touch of green light.

In the fight just now, he had obtained the two most important treasures. This item was the green square cauldron that held the treasures of Xinhu Palace—and it carried no imprint of a previous owner's divine ability or dharma power!

As his Bright Yang divine ability continuously poured in, the green cauldron began to glow. Golden light gathered within its square mouth. First, the profound-patterned flying bird patterns lit up, followed by the turtle patterns on its belly. The lake patterns also shone brightly.

By the time Li Zhouwei's escaping light stopped, pausing before a mountain peak, this Spiritual Artifact was finally refined by him. It vibrated, and all its light suddenly retracted, leaving only a thick green glow,

[Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron]!

This was a container used in Wanling Heaven to hold spiritual items, but it was also a ritual vessel for sacrifices. The Wanling Upper Sect was wealthy; this item was actually superior to Changxi's [Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger].

“It's a Spiritual Artifact of the Gathering Wood Dao. This is the first time I've gotten a Gathering Wood Spiritual Artifact... though it's not like I have many Spiritual Artifacts anyway…”

Its main marvel was called [Renew]. It could take damaged spiritual plants, pills, and spiritual resources of the same Dao lineage and be placed inside, allowing them to regain their vitality and restore their quality.

If large amounts of non-conflicting Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resources of the same Dao lineage were put inside, this item would gather divine ability and transform them into a spiritual extract.

And this cauldron's [Renew] had another extremely important benefit. If what was put inside wasn't water-virtue spiritual resources but a water-virtue spiritual item of high enough quality, presided over by the Gathering Wood divine ability, it could even transform it into Purple Mansion Realm spiritual water! As for fire-virtue... most of those conflicted with Gathering Wood, so that wouldn't work.

'This is probably this cauldron's most important function…'

Li Zhouwei thought to himself,

'Good thing spiritual sense is limited in the Grotto-Heaven. Daoist Master Luo who rushed over only saw the spiritual thunder. Otherwise, he would have definitely tried to snatch this! It's very useful for me too. At worst, I'll just have to ask him when I need to use this marvel.'

It was, after all, an item from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. It actually had two other marvels. One was called [Primal Prosperity], which could add a tiny, almost negligible, bit of good luck to the owner. He had no idea how useful it would be. It seemed to be a technique of Auspicious Qi.

The second was called [Auxiliary Rite]. This one could finally be used in a fight. It could continuously absorb thunder, water, metal, and light to suppress an enemy's marvels. Once full, it could spit out a white light to protect the owner. Although the white light's power wasn't great, the absorption ability was very useful.

'Next time I run into Miao Huanzun, I'll just use this to absorb his thunder-fall.'

He flicked a finger. The Spiritual Artifact shrank to a finger-sized small cauldron. Divine ability and dharma power condensed into a cord, tying itself to his waist. Li Zhouwei drew the [Radiant Sun King's Halberd], raised an eyebrow, and looked. Before him was a picturesque, idyllic mountain scene, beautiful and serene. Below it stood a stele,

[Clear Rite Peak].

The formation here was much worse than at Xinhu Palace. Its connection to the Grotto-Heaven's Profound Foundation was weaker. But the formation's aura was novel. Although he couldn't tell what Dao lineage it was, he could vaguely guess it was one of the Twelve Qis. Li Zhouwei gave it a second look,

“Another family… After entering this Wanling Heaven, there are so many Dao lineages I don't recognize!”

Li Zhouwei unleashed three strikes of [Splitting Light] with his halberd, and the great formation shattered. Above was a large plaque, with four words in cloud-like white script,

[Upper Rite Celestial Empyrean].

On both sides stood a large white jade treasure vase, its patterns faint, gushing Spiritual Qi. A pity they weren't Purple Mansion Realm level. They would just take up space in his storage bag. Li Zhouwei strode inside, into the inner hall. Six large pillars stood in rows. At the front were two lines of silver text,

[Consult the Nine Profundities Dharma, Four Reverences Earth]
[Six Harmonies Treasure Vase, One Spirit Heaven]

Only then did he see screens on both sides, densely covered with golden text. Li Zhouwei scanned it, knowing it was an artifact refining treatise, called [Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise], which explained the method of refining treasure vases.

Li Zhouwei simply memorized it, flicked his sleeve, and his divine ability opened all the surrounding cabinets. He took out six bottles of pills. A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed that too much time had passed. Even in the Grotto-Heaven's excellent preservation, three bottles were ruined. They must have been placed there for some time even back then.

The remaining three bottles had surging auras. They were this Dao lineage's spiritual pills, silver-white as if refined from metal. The aura was already somewhat unstable, and there was no pill fragrance.

He casually collected them and walked into the inner hall of the cave residence. On the meditation cushion, covered in dharma light, lay a crystalline white skeleton. Its cultivation in life hadn't been high, probably Qi Refining. It had committed suicide.

In the skeleton's arms was a jade slip, a jade pot, and two dharma artifacts that had degenerated from spirit embryos. Li Zhouwei collected the items. He saw the jade pot contained a light-cloud-like spiritual liquid, which gave off a transcendent, radiant, and profound aura.

'Also the same Dao lineage!'

Even if this wasn't a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item, it was at least a spiritual extract. Li Zhouwei collected it and picked up the jade slip to examine with his spiritual sense,

[Essence-Gathering Profound Origin Art].

This was actually a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation art that included a qi-gathering technique. It was an ancient art, and he couldn't tell its grade. The second half was missing. Clearly, these major Dao lineages stored their secret arts separately. The divine ability it condensed was called 'Bright Heart Feast'.

But what truly stirred Li Zhouwei's heart was that this art claimed to be from one of the Twelve Qis, the 'Upper Rite'.

'The Twelve Qis… only eight are manifest in the current age. Adding the Radiant Qi obtained by the Buddhist cultivators and the Exiled Qi sunk into the Underworld, that's ten total. The Daoist canons list all ten... but two of them are almost extinct…'

'And of these ten, I've seen almost all. This Dao lineage's feeling isn't like the brilliant Radiant Qi, nor the dark, unsearchable Exiled Qi… which means it must be one of the remaining two.'
