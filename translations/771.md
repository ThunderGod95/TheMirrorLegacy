# Chapter 771: Unexpected

The brilliance of the Shamanic Talisman Gold Charms flowed over Li Chenghui's body. As thunder rose from his feet and a powerful golden light erupted from behind him, the young man's thoughts were quickly interrupted.

*BOOM!*

Situ Mo, having been tricked and almost losing his target, was no longer just feigning fury; his face was twisted in genuine, dark rage, like a snake handler whose prey had bitten back.

The brilliance of the Golden Tang Gate Master instantly brightened. His diamond-patterned golden robe shimmered with layer upon layer of runes. With a single step, his speed was a world away from before as he reached out to seize his enemy.

A torrent of red and purple light surged over Li Chenghui, with all the purple lightning flowing down to his feet. His expression remained calm, devoid of any fear or panic, like an ice-cold pond. He stepped forward in mid-air, barely managing to evade Situ Mo's grasp by a single, narrow margin.

Situ Mo showed no remorse. As long as Li Chenghui remained within the range of his spiritual sense, there was no way he could escape. His only fear was a repeat of the momentary disappearance from before, which had sent a cold sweat down his spine.

The dark look on his face swiftly vanished, replaced by a cold ruthlessness. A point of golden light rose from the back of his head, transforming into a gourd as white and cold as snow.

'A Dharma Art... or a Dharma Artifact?' Li Chenghui didn't have time to distinguish. A chilling, splendid mist immediately poured from the gourd, descending like a heavenly light that split the clouds and shone directly on him.

Situ Mo's own speed was considerable, and he now closed the distance once more. He joined the tips of his index fingers, murmuring, "Receive the Western orthodox hue, and let the Qi arise…"

With his vast combat experience, Situ Mo didn't waste a moment. While chanting, he also sent his golden needles and golden saber flying. They first sought out the Chongming Profound Insight Screen in the air, and seeing its cyan movement, successfully forced the Dharma Artifact to appear.

Meanwhile, the chilling mist swirled over Li Chenghui. He had already surmised that Situ Mo had held back in their previous encounters, so he prepared his thunder to counter the incoming cold light.

However, a gray-green light rippled over him, and the spell's cold mist cascaded down, as if striking a slippery, round rock. It scattered to either side, and Li Chenghui found he didn't have to act at all.

This was his first time using the talisman, so he was unfamiliar with its effects. The unexpected success was a pleasant surprise, and he quickly raised his thunder. A series of piercing noises rang out in the air.

*CLANG!*

A dark-gold ruyi scepter appeared directly above his head and smashed down. Li Chenghui raised a bolt of lightning to block it, which burst in mid-air into a spray of brilliant white light and glimmering sparks.

Unfortunately, Metal is born from Earth and distinct from it, and it suppresses rampant thunder. The ruyi scepter effortlessly shattered the lightning and struck the gray-green light on his body, which instantly let out a sharp, cracking sound.

"Crack!"

Li Chenghui knew the talisman's protective power had reached its limit. He could only seize the last fading light to take a few more steps, his hand forming a spell seal as he said, "Where Yang culminates…"

Before he could finish the incantation, a cold aura surged from behind him. A torrent of Geng Metal's baleful qi rushed in, slamming into the dark-black light of the Shamanic Talisman. The black light vanished in an instant, like ebbing seawater.

The 'Concealment' ability was shattered and gone!

"Puh."

Li Chenghui spat out a mouthful of blood, which turned into scorching thunder. His cultivation was far inferior to his opponent's, and the number of years he'd spent cultivating couldn't compare. His thunder techniques were also countered, making a battle of Dharma Arts hopeless.

He could only grit his teeth and ride the thunder eastwards. Situ Mo watched him, his eyelids twitching, his expression growing ever more savage.

'He still won't give up!'

The venomous, snake-like gray rope crawled up his sleeve, and Situ Mo simply moved aside, throwing the Spirit Artifact forward.

Li Chenghui's talisman was broken, and the Spirit Artifact vanished back into the Great Void, secretly locking onto him again. A curtain of golden light, patterned with mountains and rivers, descended from the gray rope, sealing off the path to the east.

Situ Mo's heart seethed with hatred. Watching Li Chenghui trapped like a bird in a cage, he felt an unexpected sense of powerlessness. He let out a low sigh and said, "You... you are so foolish! You don't even care about your own life! How many people in your Li clan do you think I can kill?"

Li Chenghui brandished his spear, his gaze fixed on the other man as he stated calmly, "You are welcome to kill me. If killing me doesn't force anyone out, then killing anyone else is useless. Once your usefulness is gone, let's see who protects you then."

Situ Mo felt a mouthful of bitter blood stuck in his chest, unable to be spat out. His heart was hot. The situation was now clear to him: Li Minggong and the others were rushing to aid Li Chenghui. Ding Weizeng, without the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, would soon be defeated. Situ Mo's own family members were also on their way.

Li Chenghui absolutely refused to return to the lake. The only option now was to kill him.

Situ Mo refused to give up hope. "Zhaojing's plan failed. How far can Li Zhouwei hide? What good is it for you to die for nothing?"

Li Chenghui was silent for a moment. He glanced at his opponent, his striking eyes seemingly empty. He then replied, "Kill me if you must. When my clan's forces arrive, they will also kill you."

*BOOM!*

The light curtain of the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope trembled. Someone had arrived nearby. Situ Mo finally gave up. He looked at Li Chenghui one last time and said, "I don't know if I'll survive, but you must die first."

The golden screen in the air descended, and Situ Mo drew his blade. He saw the young man in silver armor and black robes spit out a brilliant, blood-stained point of light. Blood began to seep from the young man's face. Situ Mo's eyes lit up, and he let out a couple of low, laughing sounds from his throat.

He had a deep grudge against the Li clan, and seeing this scene brought him a sense of relief.

Li Chenghui's eyes bulged, and amidst a sky full of lightning, they disintegrated into points of light. His flesh and skin followed, turning into a bloody, crackling torrent of thunder. A suffocating amount of lightning filled the air. Six pieces of the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman coalesced, maniacally draining all the spiritual qi from his body.

Situ Mo retreated without hesitation. He threw the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope, which wrapped around all the lightning and hurtled far into the distance. He clasped the Purple Mansion talisman in his hand and took flight.

*BOOM!*

No matter how powerful this surge of thunder was, it was no match for a Purple Mansion Spirit Artifact, especially one of the Earth and Metal Virtues. It was ultimately contained within a long, muffled rumble. The lightning tried to lash out at Situ Mo, but it was completely trapped, unable to move a single inch.

As the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope's light faded, all the pale golden brilliance returned to the sky. Situ Mo raised his eyebrows, taking in the scene before him.

To the west were his own cultivators from the Golden Tang Gate. Situ Biao and the others stood ready, with one or two bearing minor injuries. It seemed they had dealt with Ding Weizeng.

On the other side was a woman in a red skirt, holding a six-sided lantern. Red and white flames flickered, and her brilliant eyes were filled with tears. Behind her were the rest of the Li clan members.

Should he continue to fight?

Situ Mo's mind was made up in an instant.

'The Li family has a talisman that can evade Purple Mansion-level scrying. It's not difficult for Li Zhouwei to escape the notice of Purple Mansion cultivators. If it were me, I would have fled in secret, too. Li Chenghui was right—killing them is useless now!'

Situ Mo immediately stepped back. As Situ Biao came to meet him, the Gate Master took the purple talisman from his sleeve and pressed it into the old man's hand.

*BOOM!*

The thunder in the sky suddenly flared. Even after being heavily suppressed by the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope, Li Chenghui's final, desperate act still made the heavens turn white. Everyone had to close their eyes and retreat from the blinding light.

This was precisely why Situ Mo had thrown the Spirit Artifact. He used the opportunity to catch the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope as it returned from the Great Void. From within it, he retrieved a black brocade bag, then placed the Spirit Artifact back into Situ Biao's hand. He transmitted a cold message to him: "Kill them all! I'm going to the lake to find Li Zhouwei!"

*BOOM.*

The thunder subsided, and Situ Mo's figure had already vanished as a pale golden streak of light.

Situ Biao could only activate the Spirit Artifact where he stood. A flurry of Dharma Arts passed through the thunder and headed towards him. With flames interlaced with golden water chains, the old man clutched the Purple Mansion talisman, a sense of unease rising within him.

'Why would he give this to me…?'

But he had no time to think. Li Minggong, seeing Li Chenghui's death, nearly vomited blood. Her face wet with tears, her fury was palpable. The old man could only hold up the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope.

However, he had not received the Gate Master's full inheritance. While he knew a few of the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope's wonders, he was clueless as to its true secrets. He could only release waves of yellow light to defend against the incoming Dharma Arts.

…

Situ Mo sped south for a while. Once he was out of sight, and the broad river flowed beneath his feet, he immediately changed direction and headed east towards the Eastern Sea.

This was the most promising path to survival he could think of in that instant.

He left the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope and the Purple Mansion talisman with Situ Biao, so he wouldn't be seen as coveting another's Purple Mansion artifacts. With the Rope and the talisman as a trump card, Situ Biao could continue to fulfill the Purple Mansion's orders, draw their attention, and even manage to kill one or two of the Li clan members, making his sacrifice all the more meaningful.

As for Situ Mo himself, he had deliberately taken Li Chenghui's storage bag to give Li Ximing a way to find him, so he could become a "fish hook" for the Purple Mansion cultivators. This way, even if one of them wanted to kill him, others would be unwilling to see him die.

As for "going to the lake to find Li Zhouwei," that was just a pretense to convince Situ Biao to stay behind and die for him.

'It's a pity about that Chongming Profound Insight Screen; it was a magnificent treasure. Since Li Minggong was there, I had no way to take it. If she had been able to tie me down, the outcome would have been uncertain…'

Having abandoned even the Spirit Artifact, he certainly wouldn't be greedy for the Chongming Profound Insight Screen. He rode the wind, terrified and on thin ice, his mind racing.

The sky before him slowly grew dark. Situ Mo's heart was aching with anxiety, and his hands and feet were ice-cold. The river below reflected the setting sun. He scanned the scene from south to north, as if expecting a Purple Mansion cultivator to leap out at any moment and crush him to pieces with a single palm strike.

After flying for a while, the land to the south grew desolate, turning into a vast wilderness. There was no one around, not even a passing cultivator. The river was as calm as a mirror, with no sign of a single aquatic demon.

Situ Mo's heart, to his own surprise, began to calm. A cold sweat broke out on his back, and the Golden Tang Gate Master's mind grew clearer than ever.

'I succeeded… Amidst this chaos, the Purple Mansion cultivators' positions will only become more and more fixed. They have colluded to harm Li Zhouwei, and with every passing hour, their thoughts will shift in silence toward wanting to kill Li Zhouwei, and even Li Ximing!'

'After all... even if no one else knows, it's better for those I've harmed to die sooner rather than later!'

His thoughts became more focused, buried deep within his mind. Situ Mo knew he was on the right path to survival. Li Chenghui's face, stained with blood and filled with determination, flashed in his mind for a moment, then quickly disappeared.

He continued to fly out of the wilderness, sometimes in the sky, sometimes diving deep into the river, changing his path constantly. The black storage bag of Li Chenghui was clutched in his hand like a life-saving talisman, and he never opened it.

At this point, his spiritual qi was running low. The long chase with the Spirit Artifact had left him mentally and spiritually exhausted. The tension he'd held all day finally began to ease.

*Splash!*

He burst from beneath the river's surface, sending water flying in all directions. The water fell back, and the surface of the river became a mirror once more. The world was now at its darkest point, and the surroundings were incredibly black, save for the faint sound of wind rustling through the trees.

The last of the river water dripped from him, and Situ Mo lowered his eyes, his gaze falling upon the river's surface.

Reflected in the water was a man in golden-white armor. A black robe was draped over his shoulders, billowing in the night wind. A brilliant light of Bright Yang heavenly light streamed down from his armor, rippling across the surface of the water.

His black hair was loose. Two black-flame arms grew from his back, each holding a black halberd pointed towards the river on either side. A white-veined profound armor plate extended slightly on his left hand, and his fingers were joined, pinching a shimmering golden talisman that was slowly transforming into a black light in the wind.

'Concealment.'

The young man's other hand held a long halberd outstretched. A dazzling heavenly light surged from the center of the Grand Ascension Halberd, and the sharp, long blade rapidly grew larger before his eyes. Situ Mo vaguely saw a point of light rise from the center of the other man's brow, and then, a boundless white light engulfed his vision.

*CLANG!*

The Grand Ascension Halberd struck his Dharma Robe like a streak of light, and the Golden Tang Gate's top-tier Dharma Robe groaned under the unbearable pressure. Situ Mo felt as if his internal organs were on fire.

*BOOM!*

Then, the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light smashed into his face like a sharp sword. An explosive boom mixed with the sounds of shattering reverberated through the night sky.

A mouthful of fire shot from Situ Mo's mouth and scorched his lungs, making his entire body convulse. He wasn't surprised by the man's power since he'd left seclusion. All he felt was a chilling horror.

'How is this possible?! How is he here at this time?!'

'This is a vast river! How could he have blocked my path?'

It all happened too suddenly. Situ Mo had never imagined a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion cultivator would appear right in front of him. And all the things he had relied on for his arrogance at the lake—the Purple Mansion talisman and the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope—he had thrown away in Funan!

What was more, the person who had appeared was a Purple Mansion Seed like Li Zhouwei!

His golden robe could no longer bear the strain. It dimmed in mid-air. The bright light shone through, and two arms made of black flames shot out from either side. Situ Mo's golden talismanic light shield had no time to fully form. It was seized by the arms, which were imbued with an anti-Dharma power, and it corroded away, unable to close.

*Thump!*

One of the arms suddenly locked around his throat. Situ Mo felt the world spin. The stars and moon blurred before his eyes. He had been lifted into the air and was now staring into a pair of golden pupils.

A pair of golden eyes, full of hate, as if blood were about to drip from them.
