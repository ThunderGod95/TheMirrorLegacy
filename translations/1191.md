# Chapter 1191: Abundance

The night was deep. Across the waters between islands, a grand palace shimmered with red decorations and brilliant candlelight. Li Suining arrived on the wind, pulling up just outside. Before him stood a vast, elevated platform, clad in vermilion from top to bottom. A great hall rested upon the platform, and atop the hall sat a pavilion bearing a name plaque in crimson characters on a golden field.

Fullness Palace.

He flew closer in two swift movements, seeing figures milling about on the high balcony. A young man in red was supporting an elder as they stood within the pavilion.

It was the rare and joyous occasion of Li Suihuan's wedding, and Li Xuanxuan looked invigorated. He had changed into a new, reddish robe and stood on the highest corridor, supported by Li Zhouming.

The roguish young master held the old man’s hand, casually pointing out the guests coming and going below, introducing the envoys from the various powers one by one, eliciting smiling nods from Li Xuanxuan.

His wife, Xia Shouyu, the master of the Stray Fragrance who commanded all the vital qi of the lake, seemed rather inconspicuous now. She stood on the old man’s other side with a charming smile, a jade plate in her hands upon which a cup of clear tea rested steadily.

A few feet away, Li Minggong stood in a red dress with a sword in her arms, intentionally or otherwise shielding the old man with her body. A few children from some unknown family sat on the steps, playing around a plate of pastries. Li Jiangzong, who managed the family’s affairs, was enjoying a rare moment of rest, watching the younger generation with a smile.

'So lively!'

A warmth spread through Li Suining as he took in the scene. He glanced down a level to the great hall, which was a blaze of red. The banquet inside was in full swing, guests mingling everywhere amidst a boisterous clamor. His own grand-uncle, the thunder cultivator Li Zhouda, was surrounded by a crowd, one foot propped on a wine jar, his face flushed as he gulped it down straight from the jug.

The usually serene island was filled with the festive sounds of suona horns, and familiar faces drifted through the crowd. A short distance away, his younger brother Li Suikuan stood awkwardly in a corner, at a loss as to how to respond to the flood of compliments washing over him.

When he saw Li Suining looking over, he shot him a desperate, pleading gaze. But Li Suining only smiled to himself and continued forward.

"Old Master!"

He dismissed his arcane cloud and landed on a set of steps three levels down. After a slight bow, he smiled.

"Ancestor, you're in fine spirits!"

Li Xuanxuan was enveloped by the vibrant, celebratory crowd, a smile never leaving his face. Seeing Li Suining approach, he turned and nodded. Li Minggong’s eyes lit up.

"It's a rare sight to see a man as busy as you show his face!"

With that, a group of elders swarmed him, chattering all at once and pulling him in every direction. Even though this was his third life, Li Suining still couldn't recognize them all. Unsure of who to answer first, he simply nodded along with a series of agreements, standing awkwardly in place. Just then, he heard Li Zhouming's gloating voice from the side.

"Just make him go through and recognize every single one of them! Time he learned his seniority!"

Li Suining sucked in a sharp breath. Fortunately, Xia Shouyu shot her profligate husband a subtle glare. Her face remained wreathed in smiles as she raised her voice slightly and brought the tea over. Her voice was clear and bright.

"Ning'er, it's been too long. The Old Master has missed you dearly. It's only right that you come offer him a toast!"

Finally freed from his predicament, Li Suining came forward, beads of sweat on his brow, and offered Xia Shouyu his sincere thanks. But the woman simply helped him up with a smile.

"Don't be in such a hurry to thank me! There's someone I want you to meet!"

She shifted slightly to the side, revealing a woman in a pink dress standing behind her. She appeared delicate, but her eyes were sharp and glittering. They swept over him, and as if sensing something, she smiled.

"Now this is a formidable character. The family is truly overflowing with talent!"

Li Suining paused, slightly stunned, as he heard Xia Shouyu say,

"This is your aunt, a relative from the same branch of the family. Her name includes the character 'Yi'!"

Li Suining did, in fact, recognize her. His heart stirred.

'It's the aunt who married into the Sima Family!'

He wasn't familiar with this aunt. In his first life, the Xinyu market had sunk into the sea during a shift in the earth veins, and he’d heard that Daoist Masters had even fought over it. Li Queyi had likely perished then. As for his second life, the Li family was wiped out prematurely; he couldn't imagine she had met a good end.

The woman before him, however, only saw him as calm and exceptional, his gaze sharp and unlike that of an ordinary man. She presented him with a gift of treasure medicines she had prepared, and after a warm exchange, she said,

"I've already told your brothers this, but if any of you run into trouble out there in the future, you must come to the Xinyu Archipelago. Your aunt is stationed there year-round."

Li Suining thanked her profusely, wiping sweat from his brow.

"Grand-uncle built this whole Fullness Palace below. There's so much space, why is everyone crowded up here in the pavilion? The elders are getting on in years; I'd hate for them to get jostled."

"Crowded?"

Li Zhouming snapped his feather fan shut, slapping it against his palm.

"It's not as crowded as it looks. Word got out a few days ago that the Daoist Master had come out of seclusion, and they're all betting he'll attend the wedding. So they have no choice but to squeeze in around the Old Master, hoping for a chance to say a word or two, to pass their juniors' names before the Daoist Master."

"As for those down below..." The rogue leaned close to Li Suining's ear and whispered with a laugh, "The imperial influence extends north, our radiance scatters across the Sanjiang region, the northern territories have newly submitted, and our might fills the lake—who wouldn't sing our praises? Today, a scion of our house weds, Bright Yang itself officiates the rites, and even the Imperial Court of Cultivators has sent envoys with edicts. Look at the guests! From Yuyang to the southern border, the great clans attend as if escorting royalty. Even from the desolate borderlands, the Southern Sea, and the newly risen powers of the heartlands, who would dare neglect us? They say the Purple Terrace of the Purple Smoke Gate doesn't meddle in mortal affairs and the sect of Linhai wouldn't deign to visit, yet today even they have prepared lavish gifts and sent their regards, all flocking to our island."

Li Zhouming thrived on excitement. Having had a few cups of spirit wine, the hot wind on his face only made him more unrestrained. He shook his head and laughed.

"I've already got it all planned out. I'll compose a song and call it 'Fullness Palace'. Then I'll have someone create a painting or two of this scene. I'll carry them with me, and when the day comes that I journey to the Underworld, I'll hold them close. When I see our ancestors, this will be my proof!"

He was joking around when a serene voice drifted down from above.

"Proof of what, Fifth Young Master?"

"So no one can say I was bragging!"

Li Zhouming shot back, but then he noticed that Li Minggong beside him was already bowing deeply. The surrounding clamor seemed to vanish in an instant. The area was flooded with a brilliant light, and standing there was a Daoist Master with a single point of white light between his brows, his eyes fixed upon him.

"Daoist Master!"

Li Zhouming cried out internally and dropped to his knees, immediately beginning to beg for mercy. Sure enough, he saw his grandfather shoot him an impassive glare.

"There you go again with that flippant tongue of yours," the Daoist Master said calmly. "You ought to be sent to the Court of Justice for fifty days... but today is a joyous occasion. I'd rather not hear anyone screaming."

The young man was used to being scolded and had become adept at reading the situation. He glanced around and saw that everyone else was still going about their business. Below, Li Zhouda hadn't even stopped his drinking. Realizing that no one else could see or hear this exchange, he immediately grinned.

"But it was all true!"

Li Ximing just smiled and shook his head.

"You can report there tomorrow."

The rogue froze, then wilted with a sigh. Li Xuanxuan glared at him.

"You've already reached Foundation Establishment. What kind of punishment can they give you? It's just fifty days of confinement. Must you act like you're at a funeral?"

Li Ximing's gaze swept over the group, lingering on Li Queyi with a hint of a smile. He nodded to her, but whenever he saw this particular junior, his thoughts inevitably turned to another.

"Have you heard any news of your younger sister?"

At his words, several of the younger family members looked confused. Li Queyi bowed.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, I've heard from several of my friends and fellow disciples from Purple Smoke that my sister has been cultivating under Daoist Master Wenqing. They say she reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm some years ago and has been gathering resources for her breakthrough ever since."

As she said this, a chill crept up her spine. True enough, a shadow of disappointment flickered across Li Xuanxuan's face, and the Daoist Master before her raised an eyebrow. He turned to the side.

"Jiangzong!"

Li Jiangzong took a quiet, sharp breath and bowed.

"This junior... has not received any word."

This confirmed it all. Even with the family's power at its zenith, Li Quexi, the junior who had joined an immortal sect, had no intention of relying on her family's strength to reach for the Purple Mansion Realm.

Li Ximing shook his head grimly.

"Then pay her no mind."

He took a jade slip from his sleeve and said with a serious expression, 

"Grandfather, I have not forgotten the matter you spoke to me about a some time ago."

Li Xuanxuan understood immediately. He pushed through the crowd and pulled a half-grown boy into the space of the divine ability. He placed a wrinkled hand on the child's shoulder.

"Come... Greet the Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing glanced down and saw that the child was delicate and endearing. Though too young to show any particular signs of talent, he had a cheerful and open air about him. Clearly, Li Yuanqin's eye for people was excellent.
It was Li Qinggong.

Seeing that the boy showed no fear, Li Ximing nodded in satisfaction.

"This is the 'Scarlet Palace Mystic Tiger Scripture'. It is a Hengzhu art. Though it is ungraded, it is a first-class technique of the highest quality. He will be the first Hengzhu practitioner in our family's direct line!"

Li Ximing had discussed this matter at length with Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan. After much deliberation, they had finally settled on this particular Hengzhu art.

'Our family has many who cultivate the Dao Lineages of the Five Virtues, but we have few of the Ancient Merging arts. The arts of the Three Shamans and Two Rites, however, are all exceptionally practical. Any one of them would be a great asset to our power.'

'Coincidentally, Que'wan has a Hengzhu Spiritual Treasure in her possession. If we pass down this art and a talented individual emerges in the family who reaches the Purple Mansion Realm, they will be able to utilize this treasure!'

Of course, there was a third consideration.

Ding Weizeng.

The Li family's most capable general practiced the 'Palace-Yang Tiger' art. If their own domain ascended and the Purple Mansion Realm became a possibility, the man was the most suitable candidate.

Li Ximing turned with a smile. The man with the swallow's jaw and tiger's whiskers was standing on the platform, a cup of clear wine in hand, drinking alone beneath the moon. In the next instant, he was pulled before them by the divine ability.

"Congratulations!"

The distant sounds of horns and firecrackers faded away. The battle-hardened man, renowned for his meritorious service, reacted in a flash. His hand went to the weapon on his back before he quickly lowered it and returned the bow. His face was a mixture of joy and worry.

"Greetings, Daoist Master."

The wedding of Ding Yujing and Li Suihuan was a grand affair, yet the man was fraught with anxiety, a torrent of words seemingly dammed up inside him. 

"Though Yujing is but a woman, she loves to brandish spears and staves. I fear her temperament is not gentle enough, and she may not be able to please His Highness. I hardly dare presume to be his father-in-law..."

Ding Weizeng was no brute; his concerns were not without reason. Being the father-in-law to a royal scion was a glorious position for now, but Bright Yang was known to be both passionate and ruthless. If the day came when the couple had a falling out and truly couldn't reconcile, what would become of him, Ding Weizeng?

Li Ximing surely saw his apprehension but paid it no mind. He simply smiled, shook his head, and produced a purple scroll from his sleeve.

"First, convert your cultivation according to this scripture," he said seriously. "Then begin practicing this art. When you have finished mastering it, come find me on the mountain."

The scroll contained the 'Scarlet Palace Mystic Tiger Scripture' and two appended secret arts.

Li Ximing had certainly considered Ding Weizeng's future path, but he also had to be realistic about his trusted general's capabilities. By his estimation, even though Ding Weizeng ranked among the best of the Li family's cultivators—more outstanding than even Li Zhouda or Li Minggong—his chances of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm were still slim.

'I'll just place this piece on the board and see what happens. If he truly has some hidden talent and can master this in twenty or thirty years, it wouldn't be unreasonable to find a Purple Mansion spiritual item for him. But if he can't, if it takes him sixty or seventy years... then I can only help him fulfill his heart's desire in the final moments of his life.'

At first, Ding Weizeng was confused. But as he took the scroll and began to read, shock and a tremor of disbelief surged through him. The iron-willed warrior immediately understood the Daoist Master's intent. His eyes reddened, and he stared blankly at the man before him, his voice trembling.

"This subordinate... I am unworthy... I am not worthy of this!"

He came from a disgraced line of officials. To have climbed to his current position within the Li family was already an unbelievable honor that left him perpetually overwhelmed. He had never imagined that his lord would seek out a Purple Mansion cultivation method for him.

For a Purple Mansion master, allowing anyone other than a direct descendant or a personally-tutored disciple to attempt a breakthrough was a great risk. You could lose an incredibly useful, meticulously trained subordinate, and gain little in return after their success. In fact, a newly ascended master could even become a threat to your own status and interests. The former Tang Shecheng had served Yuanwu diligently for a century, yet he was denied a Purple Mansion art even on his master's deathbed. And he was a clansman. Ding Weizeng was merely a surrendered general who didn't even share the family name.

Furthermore, the Li family had no connection to the Hengzhu Immortal Dao. How could they have possibly, by some great coincidence, obtained a Purple Mansion art for the 'Palace-Yang Tiger'? It must have been painstakingly acquired through trade.

'Where in this world could one find such a master!'

Ding Weizeng felt as if he were in a dream. He stood there, stunned, tears welling in his eyes. Li Ximing, however, simply laughed and shook his head casually, his gaze turning to the lively scene outside. The beautiful couple had completed the ceremonies and were now approaching the pavilion, surrounded by their procession.

He stood with his hands behind his back, enjoying a rare, leisurely moment watching the festivities. But then, the Light of the Six Harmonies coiling around his fingertips pulsed slightly, and a realization dawned on him.

'This is... someone from the Dragon-kin has arrived.'

Li Ximing had taken care of many things since emerging from the island's core, but there were still more arrangements to be made.

A few days prior, he had received word that Daoist Master Xiang Chun of the Dragon-kin possessed a treasure even more effective at extending life than the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill. He had extended an invitation, intending to send someone to her on a chosen day.

He had originally planned to give that Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill to Li Xuanxuan. While Li Ximing was only interested in its life-extending properties, its other miraculous uses had captured the Daoist Master's heart, and she had long ago offered to trade for it. The problem was that life-extending spiritual items were exceedingly rare, and those that could gently add decades to the life of a mortal not yet at the Foundation Establishment Realm were rarer still. It had taken her until now to find a suitable exchange.

'As expected of someone with the backing of the Dragon-kin, her resources are far greater. Though old Daoist Master Shanbai also wishes to trade for the pill, he cannot hope to compete with her.'
