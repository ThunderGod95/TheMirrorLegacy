# Chapter 813: Within the Secret Diffusion

Cui Jueyin acknowledged the order. Li Jiangqian shook his head and said, "With the Purple Smoke Gate shifting manpower to the Eastern Sea, our production speed slows daily. But since the Daoist Master hasn't returned, delays are acceptable. The clan is stable; these are minor issues. Protector Cui, you are often on the Eastern Shore. Do you know what’s happening with Jiangxia?"

Li Jiangqian pointed to several letters on his desk, their format indicating they were almost certainly from Li Jiangxia. He frowned. "For several months now, the families on the Eastern Shore and the autonomous territories in the wilderness have gone silent. The number of disciples coming to the forest has plummeted. This is supposed to be the triennial intake, yet almost no one has shown up... This is no simple matter."

The Eastern Shore comprised 118 families, and their autonomous territories extended into the wilderness. Li Jiangxia had spent years chipping away at this region. Although they had been struck once by the Capital immortals Dao, their foundation remained unshaken. Though called the Eastern Shore, the name no longer covered the scope of their influence. If the entire wilderness were divided into five parts, the western two were under the Li family's remote control.

These territories were crucial sources of spiritual materials. Now that they needed to forge the Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails, this supply line was even more critical. He couldn't ignore it.

Cui Jueyin nodded. "I have received word... and I have determined the cause."

"In recent years, the Sacred Writ Gate in the eastern Shanji Prefecture has stabilized its foothold and begun recruiting widely. This group of demonic cultivators seems to be imitating the Chengyun Gate. With the Purple Smoke Gate backing them, they intend to transition to a righteous path..."

"They are desperately short on low-level cultivators, so their standards are low. Their main requirement is a 'clean background,' and they prefer cultivators from Jiangnan... Shanji Prefecture is blocked to the north by the Xuanmiao Temple and flanked by Supreme Yang lineages. Only the wilderness has a large population of cultivators... but the wilderness is full of rogue cultivators, a mixed bag with scattered and disorganized lineages. Even with the Sacred Writ Gate's low standards... few qualify."

"However, the wilderness borders the Eastern Shore. As it happens, the Eastern Shore families have spent years cultivating disciples according to the season, preparing them for the forest's recruitment. They focused on solidifying cultivation and building strong foundations, not rushing their training. When the Sacred Writ Gate opened its gates wide, they all flocked east to try their luck."

Beyond the Eastern Shore lay the autonomous lands, so those families primarily offered tribute through mining and planting. Unlike the prefectures on the lake, which were clearly internal territory, there was no need for the kind of diplomacy used with Ding Mu. After hearing the explanation, Li Jiangqian didn't seem anxious.

He nodded. "It makes sense. My family already has too many guest elders, too many rules, and not much enjoyment. Their future prospects here are far worse than with the Sacred Writ Gate. How could our offer compare to the comfort of being a disciple in a Purple Mansion Realm sect?"

Cui Jueyin bowed. "The Clan Head speaks truly... However, the Sacred Writ Gate lineage is only using them as fillers. They'll enter as outer disciples, lacking cultivation time and resources. It won't necessarily be better..."

"That's not important... Everyone has their own ambitions. We aren't lacking one or two batches of people." Li Jiangqian raised his eyes, his gaze settling heavily on the map scroll on the table. "What I fear is that they join the Sacred Writ Gate one by one. Today they take this family, tomorrow that one. If all one hundred and eighteen families are taken away, the east will be strengthened, but what about our west?"

Cui Jueyin nodded hesitantly and spoke softly, "The Third Young Master has been cultivating his influence there for many years. Perhaps we should integrate the Eastern Shore and wilderness region and establish a Prefecture Peak... But I fear this will make all those families anxious... It would not be easy to manage."

The crimson-robed youth shook his head. "Prefecture Peaks cannot be expanded lightly, much less swallow over a hundred families at once. This is about our family's reputation. Those Eastern Shore families exist to give the families bordering the lake someone lower-ranked to look down upon; it’s a method of uniting our core vassals by giving them superiority."

"Furthermore, these families are remnants from the era of the Jiang and Yu clans. When the Yu family weakened, they couldn't be touched, fine. But why didn't the Jiang family act? Why didn't the Xiao family? The Azure Pond Sect rule forbidding sects from crossing prefectural boundaries is not just empty words; it originates from the ancient Moonlight Origin Mansion. Under the Mansion's governance, only a true Sect can operate across prefectures. Even the Purple Smoke Gate must keep to its designated borders."

"Secondly, it avoids creating a direct border with other Purple Mansion powers... My family has the forest to manage these families; the Xiao family has Mount Yu. It is the same structure."

Li Jiangqian pondered this, looking at the map. "The wilderness also borders the Xiao family, near Mount Yu. Many must be going there to cultivate as well. Yet the Lixia Xiao family has not reacted... This makes things difficult."

He looked up. "Do all those families have people serving in the forest? Immediately revoke their positions. For those who went to the Sacred Writ Gate but failed the entrance, the forest will not accept them either. I will send someone east to ask questions. That Dai Jinquan of the Sacred Writ Gate seems reasonable. We will ask first."

***

Li Jiangqian waved Cui Jueyin away. Finally, a person ascended from the hall below. Dili Guang had followed Li Zhouluo to the Southern Sea, so this attendant was from the Dou family. He bowed.

"Reporting to the Clan Head, Guest Elder Miaoshui has returned."

Li Jiangqian looked up, concerned. "Alone? Or with Guest Elder Wang?"

The man replied, "Three returned together. They are already in the side courtyard, and are said to be heavily injured."

Li Jiangqian frowned and immediately descended. He arrived just as the three were approaching. Miaoshui’s aura was stable, though her robes were ragged. She bowed first. Wang Quwan followed behind her, sword at his waist, his face pale.

The last person was a stranger, his face covered in cold sweat and his clothes stained with blood. A golden, armor-like energy had invaded his body, freezing his limbs purple and making him stiff as he bowed.

Li Jiangqian let out a hearty laugh and stepped down from the dais, taking Wang Quwan’s hand. "Quwan, you are truly a peerless talent! You have returned safely, just as I expected!"

He then turned to the stranger, perplexed. "And this is..."

As Li Jiangqian began to ask, Wang Quwan cupped his fist. "This is Daoist Shouding from Mount Jingyi. We fought enemies together within the earth palace. He was injured when we escaped that perilous place. Considering the long road back to the Eastern Sea, and knowing we must pass through the territory of the Chunyi Dao Gate, I feared an ambush. Thus, I invited him here to the lake to rest."

'Mount Jingyi!'

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian immediately scrutinized the man. This Daoist Shouding looked young, with narrow eyes and an unimpressive demeanor. Perhaps he was suffering the backlash of a technique, as his hair and beard looked somewhat withered. Wounded by that golden energy, he couldn't even speak.

During the Profound Peak incident years ago, Changxi had gifted Yuezhou Island to Mount Jingyi. They should have been allies of the Profound Peak faction. Yet Mount Jingyi had never sent a single person, nor a single resource. They left the Kong family to struggle alone in Jiangnan, which indirectly led to Li Ximing being completely trapped. To put it unkindly, Sumian had at least spoken up; Daoist Master Xuanyi hadn't even opened her mouth. She hadn't so much as passed wind.

The core Profound Peak lineage despised them for this. While the Xuanmiao Temple hadn't suffered losses, Sumian was equally displeased with Xuanyi. Since his own family had been harmed by the affair, Li Jiangqian had nothing good to say about Mount Jingyi either.

Yet, of all the families in Jiangnan, this man had met Wang Quwan. And now he was here, delivered to the Li family. Only Li Jiangqian, with his deep political cunning, could maintain a smiling, courteous expression.

"So, it is a guest from the immortal Mount Jingyi. This is only proper. Please, rest in a grotto-mansion... If you require any resources, you need only ask."

Daoist Shouding’s face was purple, his lips trembling. He managed a strained sound of acknowledgment, then coughed up a mouthful of blood, unable to even offer polite pleasantries. Li Jiangqian had Miaoshui escort the man away but bid Wang Quwan to sit in the hall. Only then did he return to his seat, a plan forming.

'I wonder if this fellow's mouth is tight. Since he's from Mount Jingyi, I must try to find out... probe him indirectly, and see what kind of relationship Changxi and Xuanyi truly have.'

Aloud, he smiled. "Congratulations on your return... How were things inside the earth palace?"

As he spoke, his gaze rested on Wang Quwan, heavy with meaning.

'Based on his actions, he must have spoken a great deal with that Shouding in the palace. As a disciple of Jingyi, Shouding must understand the secrets of the Secret Diffusion lineage. The question is, did Wang Quwan manage to learn anything?'

At his question, Wang Quwan quickly bowed. He retrieved a large box from his sleeve and opened it before him. Inside rested a red pearl chain and a long, earth-yellow shield—the very Crimson Orb Jade and Hundred-Stone Spirit Shield he had borrowed.

She reported, "Clan Head, the earth palace contains deeper mysteries. We traveled to the lowest level, entered an earth vein, and then another vein beyond that, where we found a pool of Converging Water. It contained a universe within."

"Upon entering that pool, we found a palace inscribed with the words 'The Grand Secret Mirage-Vault.' The long plaques on either side had been stolen. The moment we passed the palace, water, fire, and lightning descended upon us. We flew and shuttled through it... for an entire year."

"The water, fire, and lightning were weak at first, but the water was Converging Water and the fire was Merging Fire. It burned hotter and hotter, and the lightning shattered our techniques. Fortunately, I had the two artifacts the family granted me—especially the Crimson Orb Jade—and my Floating Cloud Body supporting me. Only then did I pass."

Li Jiangqian felt something was wrong. 'A Grotto-Heaven? But what kind of Grotto-Heaven traps Foundation Establishment cultivators for a year and a half while they are still flying? How could it possibly be that large?'

Wang Quwan continued, "Past the trial of elements, we saw a stone bridge. According to Daoist Shouding, the bridge was crafted from an Wu Earth spiritual material. The entire bridge was covered by a great array that suppressed spiritual sense. I groped my way to the midpoint and found a stone stele inscribed with the three words: 'Code of Golden Manifestation.' A box containing water was granted from the sky. I took it, but the path ahead vanished, and I was forced to retreat."

"When I returned, I found Shouding. He said that 'Code of Golden Manifestation' required a Metal-Virtue Dharma Art to break. I have not learned one, so I turned back. But the exit path had changed. A crowd of people inside seemed to be fighting over something. I found a place to hide. After half a year or so, a large group moved off in one direction, and I seized the chance to escape."

"But the moment we emerged from the pool of Converging Water, a group of demonic cultivators ambushed us. Thankfully, the artifacts in our hands were powerful... but Daoist Shouding suffered greatly... The demonic cultivators saw his higher cultivation level and assumed the leader must have the treasures, so they focused all their attacks on him... He even used up the talismans his master had given him."

Li Jiangqian listened silently, then asked, "This Shouding from Mount Jingyi... how did he come to be with you?"

Wang Quwan replied succinctly, "He was severely injured but knew the way out. Shouding led me to the exit, and I protected him along the way."

Curiosity sparked in Li Jiangqian. 'Xuanyi understands the Secret Diffusion that well? It seems that if we want that treasured sword, Mount Jingyi could be a useful asset...'

After finishing his report, he bowed slightly, retrieved another box from his storage bag, and opened it before Li Jiangqian, revealing a light, translucent spiritual liquid.

"I did not recognize this spiritual item, but I brought it back for the family."

Li Jiangqian immediately frowned. "This is an opportunity you earned. What nonsense are you speaking?"

Only then did he glance at it, recognizing it instantly. "This is Clear Origin Spirit Water. It can be used to cultivate ocular techniques. You keep it. It is exactly one portion, and it will be of great use to you!"

Before Wang Quwan could reply, Li Jiangqian waved his hand dismissively. "Anything obtained from a Dao repository belongs entirely to you."

Wang Quwan hesitated a moment but finally put the item away. He bowed deeply and said in a low voice, "Clan Head... I noticed one other thing... I fought many people within the earth palace. The deeper we went into the veins, the stronger the cultivators became, yet their Immortal Foundations grew increasingly monotonous. There seemed to be only a few types. I privately asked Daoist Shouding, and he claimed that those who enter the earth palace with similar Dao lineages naturally gather together..."

Li Jiangqian remained noncommittal, unsure if he was telling the truth or repeating a fabrication. He rubbed the jade cup in his hand, appearing to make a decision. Finally, he spoke.

"As I thought..."

Wang Quwan looked puzzled. Li Jiangqian shook his head. "This matter concerns the Purple Mansion realm. I have a few speculations... which I can share with you, Quwan."

Wang Quwan immediately bowed, clearly having harbored these doubts for a long time.

Li Jiangqian said seriously, "If I am not mistaken, that earth palace was built by the Chengyun Gate. The demonic cultivators waiting outside were also their people. They discovered a specific Dao lineage underground, one that requires specific Immortal Foundations to enter... so they distributed tokens far and wide to those with the right foundations... letting those people enter the grotto for them, only to kill them when they emerged."

His expression darkened. "When the Floating Cloud Cave was destroyed, its techniques and resources were sent here by the other two caves. The technique you cultivate came from the Brahma Cloud Cave, which is backed by the Chengyun Gate... It seems their original plan was to give it to one of our family's disciples, lure them to that pool of Converging Water, and kill them... Divination is likely blocked in that place. Fortunately, Quwan, you were cautious and did not fight them for treasure... and the Daoist Master granted you a pill, allowing you to reach Foundation Establishment, which is how you escaped intact."

Wang Quwan froze, a flicker of shock passing over him.

Li Jiangqian smiled, shaking his head. "But the Daoist Master is far-sighted, beyond anything you or I could know. Perhaps he already saw through Chengyun Gate's scheme. He values you highly, so he specially granted you the pill for a battlefield breakthrough, leaving them entirely empty-handed... What was a minor trick by the Chengyun Gate instead became your destined opportunity..."

Li Jiangqian had twisted the order of events, lightly inserting Li Ximing's name with casual confidence, deftly papering over the family's failure to warn him sooner. Shock slowly dawned on Wang Quwan’s face. He processed the implications and let out a long breath.

Li Xuanxuan had genuinely given him the artifacts to protect his life. Neither Li Jiangqian nor Li Zhouluo had involved themselves in his gains, making their attitude clear. Wang Quwan bowed deeply. "My only regret is that my cultivation is shallow. I could not fight for more and wasted the opportunity the Daoist Master gave me..."

"That is nothing," Li Jiangqian smiled. "Based on your description, that place is not somewhere a few Foundation Establishment cultivators can explore in one trip. Go find Sun Bai for healing first. I will write a letter and ask the master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion. We will definitely gain something from this."
