# Chapter 1055: Possession

Liu Changdie rolled up the scroll in his hands and dismissed Li Que'wan. He then hurried to the edge of the great formation, where he saw a lone figure standing above the churning sea. The man’s eyes were a startling mix of white and red. He was clad in bone armor and blood-red silks, a pair of golden wings folded neatly behind him as he stood in silence.

Seeing his faint and listless aura, Liu Changdie was filled with sorrow. He quickly opened a path in the formation and gestured for the man to enter. The Demon King strode in with his hands behind his back, staggering like a lost soul.

He cried out in a rasping voice, "Gods… I almost didn't make it!"

Liu Changdie sighed. As he led the man inside, he retrieved a vial of spirit pills from his sleeve.

"Are you feeling any better?"

Fuxun took the jade vial, uncorked it, and, to Liu Changdie’s pained expression, poured the pills into his cavernous mouth as if they were candy. The demon beast didn't seem to taste them at all. He smacked his lips, his red eyes fixed on Liu Changdie.

"What are you looking so pained for? Following that great Alchemist, how could you possibly be short on pills?"

Li Ximing had indeed refined and left behind pills for him when he came for the cultivation art, but Liu Changdie was exceptionally frugal. He shook his head and sighed.

"These are not normal times. He possesses an abundance of spiritual materials and resources, so much so that even the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition in its heyday was never so extravagant. Besides… how could I simply take his things for free!"

Others might not have known, but Liu Changdie had been the one to handle every single transaction for the Neck Feathers. He even knew that the supply of Wall-Sinking Water from the Eastern Sea had dried up long ago, halting production entirely. Liu Changdie knew exactly how luxurious Li Ximing’s cultivation was. Even with his own considerable wealth, he could only admit his own inferiority.

Meanwhile, Fuxun had taken a seat. He glanced around the wondrous, blue-and-gold cave-residence with a nod of approval, then began brewing himself a pot of tea while cursing.

"Damn that blasted White Victory Dao! Damn that Zha'xi Ciwang! The day I achieve the Dao and become a great Demon King, I’ll punch three holes straight through their sacred palace!"

Liu Changdie frowned. He watched as the demon beast lifted his robes, revealing three massive holes in his otherwise flawless, jade-like Dharma Body. But inside the wounds, there was no bone or flesh. Instead, they looked like a rich man's cellar; golden sand cascaded like a waterfall, with gold tables and chairs scattered about. Emeralds and rubies the size of fingernails dotted the scene, where one or two lavishly dressed, thumb-sized lesser demons knelt in the sand, weeping.

Liu Changdie stared, stunned for a moment.

"The Xipo Kingdom is lost? Who took it!"

"Lost, of course it's lost!" Fuxun said mournfully. "Carved up by those bastards. Luckily, I took an Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill long ago and successfully refined the Observing Jin Auspicious Body. I gathered all my subordinates and fled, otherwise I'd be all alone today!"

The profundity of Fuxun's Observing Jin Auspicious Body was limitless. While it bore some resemblance to the Murong clan’s ability to contain things within their bodies, its fundamental nature was entirely different. In essence, it was a Body Divine Ability that created an enormous physical form, allowing countless demons to attach themselves to it. The art then transformed this main body and all the attached demons into a new shape, concealing them beneath his skin.

Liu Changdie was momentarily speechless. He didn't believe for a second that Fuxun was particularly benevolent toward his so-called subordinates. They were there for two reasons: one, to run errands, serve him, and help him cultivate his Dharma Body; and two, they were probably emergency rations for when his injuries became unstable.

Though he was certain of this, he asked aloud,

"Senior Qingyan…"

Fuxun’s face contorted with grief and despair.

"They captured him!" he spat through gritted teeth.

"What?!"

Liu Changdie had anticipated that the two demons might face a calamity, but he never imagined it would be this severe. He was horrified.

"Senior Qingyan… How could they have calculated his whereabouts! Doesn't he possess a wondrous art to conceal himself? Situ Huo ambushed him for ten years and never caught him… How could…"

He cut himself off, suddenly realizing that Situ Huo was nothing compared to the White Victory Dao. He fell silent.

Fuxun said bitterly,

"The White Victory Dao is not what it once was. That great lord must be showing signs of revival, perhaps he's even regained some ability to act! Only by borrowing his divine power could they have schemed against Qingyan so easily!"

At the mention of the fiend from the Great Western Plateau, a flicker of terror crossed Fuxun's eyes, and he seemed momentarily flustered.

"When the White Victory Dao ambushed us, we were no match for them. Fortunately, Qingyan still had that Azure Tome of Subjugation. He used it to buy us a chance to escape from the White Victory Dao Lord, though it came at the cost of grievous injury. But that man has a Profound Banner! As long as our wounds haven't healed, they can track us anywhere!"

"We fled in terror, even casting an art to call for your help, but we were out of hope. That wondrous art you mentioned… it was enough to fool someone like Situ Huo, but how could it ever deceive the White Victory Dao Lord? He carried the Wind-Horse Profound Banner. Even though Qingyan's art let him flee over a thousand miles, a single wave of that banner was all it took to find him again. If I hadn't broken away when I did… I would’ve been captured along with him!"

A wave of guilt and unease washed over Liu Changdie. He lowered his head. 

"It's not that I wouldn't save you… That night, this place was wracked with lightning and thunder. A Daoist Master was lying in ambush nearby, waiting for me. If I had gone out, I wouldn't have been able to save myself either."

The Demon King began to wail at the table. His tears fell like crystals, and as a Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat, a naturally strange species, a fragrant powder scattered where they landed, filling the air with an exotic scent. After crying for a while, he shook his head.

"How could I ever distrust you! I figured it out long ago. Since they were so determined to capture Qingyan, they would have been watching from every angle. How could they possibly have let you come to the rescue!"

He collapsed back in his seat, utterly devastated.

"Such pain!"

Liu Changdie wasn't as close with Qingyan as he was with Fuxun, but they were well-acquainted. A storm of complex emotions churned within him, and a surge of grief rose in his heart.

"What could I have done even if I had saved you?" he sighed. "The White Victory Dao Lord came personally. How many rounds could I last against him…"

But just as the demon before him lowered his head, his jade-white cheek suddenly began to writhe, as if something underneath were struggling violently to break free. A grotesque, fist-sized face tore its way out. Its two eyes were hollow sockets, the flesh sunken in, and they stared blankly at Liu Changdie.

Liu Changdie staggered back a step in shock.

"What foul creature are you!" he roared.

His shout was infused with divine ability and dharma power, yet it only caused the fist-sized face to pause for a moment. Its hollow eyes shifted, as if surveying the surroundings. Fuxun’s reaction, however, was faster. His hands shot up and viciously clamped down on the face.

The tumor-like visage was instantly crushed. Pale golden blood burst from between his fingers, releasing a strange fragrance. Fuxun wiped the blood away, his eyes cold and vicious as he broke into a violent coughing fit.

Liu Changdie’s brow was tightly furrowed. He remained silent for a long time. After his coughing subsided, Fuxun knew the other man was waiting for an explanation. He forced a smile.

"I was hit by the White Victory Dao Lord's Lesser Yang art. My Dharma Body is probably filled with these little Yang Worms, all eagerly waiting to report back to him."

Seeing Liu Changdie’s tense expression, Fuxun understood and quickly shook his head.

"Don't worry, don't worry. I came here during a gap when they were being summoned by his prayer banner. Once I entered the great formation and was sealed off from the Great Void, it got much better. No message can get out now, so relax… _cough_… _cough_…"

Only then did Liu Changdie feel some relief, though he was still torn between sympathy and anxiety.

"It's not that I'm being suspicious," he said in a low voice. "This Deer Weeds Island is Li Ximing's territory. It's already a great kindness that he allows me to cultivate here. If something were to happen, if I were to bring disaster down upon this place… how could I ever face him!"

They looked at each other in silence. Liu Changdie sighed.

"I will take responsibility for your injury. Supreme Yang spiritual items are hard to find, but I'll think of other ways. I can contact some high-level cultivators who specialize in healing arts for you. For now, just stay here and recuperate, senior."

Fuxun lowered his head, wanting to say something grateful, but no words came out. He simply raised his cup. After a long pause, he sighed. "After this battle, the Great Western Plateau now looks down upon Poluoduo, controlling it completely. There's no going back. All the demon beasts in Poluoduo are in for a world of pain… and I have nowhere left to run!"

"My family, my followers… their upkeep is immense. And I myself must pursue the Dao. I certainly can't go to the outer seas. The Western Sea, the Northern Sea… is there any place for me in either?"

Liu Changdie remained silent, shaking his head.

"Where else can you go now? I doubt you even dare to step outside this formation!"

Despite his words, he began to think of a path forward for the Demon King. 

"What about… the Dragon-kin?"

A flicker of interest appeared in Fuxun’s eyes, but he shook his head hesitantly, gritting his teeth.

"My bloodline is… unusual. I’m truly afraid one of the Dragon Kings might just eat me! Before coming here, I had to ask around through my connections. Otherwise, how would I dare just stroll into this territory?"

"And even if I weren't eaten… my future would be uncertain. We demons are not like you humans. If they have no use for me, how could I dare to pledge allegiance so recklessly!"

Sensing that Fuxun had something more to say, Liu Changdie asked,

"It seems you have a plan, senior."

Fuxun sighed.

"To be honest, I'm at my wit's end. The White Victory Dao never had room for me; it's just that I used to keep a low profile… prancing around outside their line of sight."

"They are notoriously vengeful. That old friend of my father's… all he did was step in to save someone, and he later died a miserable death at their hands. It's only because you didn't come to our rescue that I can hide here with you for a while."

He looked somewhat embarrassed.

"That… that White Qilin… he has ties with the Dragon-kin. I was hoping that through him… I might find a powerful backer."

Liu Changdie finally understood. He was silent for a long time.

'Dragon-kin… And since when are dragons a benevolent sort? Li Zhouwei calls himself the White Qilin and seems close with the dragons, but who doesn't know what that bunch from the Hornless Dragon lineage is scheming!'

Liu Changdie knew nothing of the great powers' grand plans, but he would bet his life that the Dragon-kin had ulterior motives. Unless it was a last resort, he truly didn't want to trouble Li Ximing.

'I just hope this doesn't attract any major trouble.'

But Fuxun's situation was also important. He was caught between a rock and a hard place. After a long silence, Liu Changdie finally replied,

"I will ask on your behalf, senior. But I cannot promise whether it will succeed or fail."

He chose a cave-residence for Fuxun to enter seclusion. After the earlier episode, the Demon King's condition seemed to have worsened. He stumbled as he walked, and worse, his mind seemed to be wandering, a clear sign that his foundations had been shaken.

Liu Changdie silently shook his head and left. He had only taken a few steps when he saw Li Que'wan hurrying across the main hall, her face slightly pale.

Liu Changdie quickly called out to her.

"The senior's arrival was sudden," he said with a sigh. "I will write a letter to Ximing. You need not worry."

"I will prepare the things he needs for his recovery. However, he still has many subordinates with him. I'll have to trouble you to arrange for some people to prepare spirit grain and food for him on a daily basis."

Li Que'wan lowered her gaze slightly, her expression quickly returning to one of composure. 

"Yes," she said respectfully.

Liu Changdie sighed inwardly.

'Gaining a Demon King for no reason… This probably won't be easy to explain to Ximing.'

In the hall of white jade, which was like a construct of snow, the light of the sun and moon shone down together. A pale azure sword was embedded among the bright white jade stones, with a cup of clear tea balanced on its hilt. No matter how the longsword trembled, it could not dislodge the cup.

'Fuxun…'

On the table lay an azure scroll, its pale gold, mystical patterns flickering in and out of sight. The man beside the table wasn't looking at the sword, but was gazing out beyond the realm's border, lost in thought.

After the fall of Wanling Heaven, Lu Jiangxian had been forced to divide his attention. He had to monitor the overall situation, compose the method for seeking Gold for Chi Buzi, and simultaneously suppress the Way of the Sword dao inheritance within Li Jiangchun. He was incredibly busy.

The most mentally taxing of these tasks was the method for seeking Gold. Such methods were inherently difficult to create, and Chi Buzi’s was a unique case. The theory behind it was sound, but there was a world of difference between a mere Daoist treatise and actually writing out the complete method. Its profundity and difficulty made the Nine Dao Secret Arts he had created in the past—which had the benefit of borrowing from existing Metallic Essence concepts—seem like child's play in comparison.

In truth, Li Zhouwei’s method for seeking Gold was equally important, but he hadn't even started on it yet. Lu Jiangxian was confident he could manage Li Zhouwei's cultivation progress; there was still time. Chi Buzi, on the other hand, was a rare, unpredictable piece on the board. His mind was flighty, and he had ties to various powers. His future trajectory, under the indirect influence of the various Dao Embryo plots, had become difficult to calculate.

Therefore, Lu Jiangxian had prioritized his method, in case the situation suddenly changed and Chi Buzi found himself standing at the forefront of a new era with an empty mind, staring blankly at Du Qing after regaining his memories.

It was because his attention was so divided that Lu Jiangxian’s perception of the Eastern Sea was not as sharp as usual. Fortunately, Li Que'wan was an astute and careful person. The moment she saw a Demon King enter the formation, she had naturally used the Immortal Mirror to scan him. That single scan was enough to jolt Lu Jiangxian to full attention.

'Something's wrong…'

Under the illumination of his divine sense, a bright golden thread, fine as a hair, hovered above Fuxun's head, attached to some distant, intangible point. And on the back of his head, another face was faintly visible. It had sharp teeth, golden lips, a low-bridged nose, and pure white pupils. Its features writhed and shifted, roaming erratically across the back of his skull.

The first instant Lu Jiangxian saw it, he knew this creature was not of the Purple Mansion Realm. He was shaken. Looking closer, he detected the flavor of Metallic Essence… He searched his memory and suddenly recalled that strange True Qi bird from long ago!

'Liu Changdie, oh, Liu Changdie, you've invited a plague into your home!'

A Metallic Essence fiend!

A world-destroying monster, exceedingly rare in the current age!

Upon careful consideration, it was clear this fiend had cultivated some wondrous art. It was hidden so perfectly, almost completely cut off from all external information, that it had to rely on Fuxun’s injuries "flaring up" just to observe the outside world. This spoke to its incredible skill, but a fiend's cunning nature did nothing to reduce the danger it posed.

Fuxun thought he was merely injured, that there were still Yang Worms left by the White Victory Dao Lord that he had yet to expel. In reality, it was just the fiend occasionally stirring, wanting to use his body as a vessel to peer out at the world!

'It's perfectly normal that Li Que'wan was scared white… In fact, her ignorance was bliss. She only thought it was terrifying because of how it looked. If she truly knew what this thing was, forget her, even Chi Buzi would be drenched in a cold sweat. This is a fiend… something involving a Golden Core existence!'

If this fiend were to go berserk, it wouldn't matter if the Purple Mansion Realm formation could hold it. The entire island chain would be transformed into a living hell. Sovereign Fire, Minister Fire, Dawn Fire… all sorts of spiritual flames would manifest alongside the light of the Lesser Yang, and the next thing to descend would be the true body of the Dragon Monarch of the Northern Sea!

Lu Jiangxian frowned and watched for a long while. He saw that Fuxun’s expression was normal, but he didn't dare look away. Watching him crush the "Yang Worm" on his face, Lu Jiangxian felt a chill in his heart and muttered to himself.

'Where is the Underworld? And the two Dragon Monarchs in the Eastern Sea… how can they have no reaction at all?'
